The black box cockpit voice recorder from an Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed into the Mediterranean several weeks ago, killing all on board, has been found by search crews. The flight data recorder had been recovered earlier in the day. The bodies of eight victims were recovered from what is believed to be fuselage."We found it and retrieved it about an hour ago today," Lebanese army Brigadier Saleh Haj Suleiman said, as quoted by BusinessWeek. According to reports, the plane made a sharp turn and disappeared from the radar upon departure; Lebanese officials, however, say it's too early to conclude the crash was due to pilot error.The black box records communication data, technical information such as speed, altitude, etc., as well as conversation in the airplane cockpit, which could help investigators determine why the jet crashed.The boxes will be transported to France to be analysed, according to officials.Flight ET409, which had departed from Beirut, Lebanon, was bound for Addis Ababa in Ethiopia on January 25 when it crashed into the waters of the Mediterranean Sea several minutes after takeoff, in inclement weather. All ninety people aboard were killed.Minister of Public Works and Transport Ghazi Aridi told Reuters, "The priority now is searching for the rest of the bodies of victims." So far, the bodies of 23 victims have been recovered.Speaking in Khartoum today, Jan Egeland, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator of the United Nations, said “this is the moment of truth. We are playing with a powder keg”. This followed disagreement about the role that UN would play in providing a force to help deal with the crisis in Darfur.Kofi Annan, retiring UN Secretary General, yesterday announced agreement of African, Arab and European leaders to provide a 20,000 force to supplement the 7,000 African Union peacekeepers trying to cope with the situation that had resulted in 240,000 being killed and 2.5 million being displaced during three years of conflict in the western region. However, Lam Akol, the Sudanese foreign minister, said: "What we agreed upon in Addis Ababa was the African Union (AU) force assuming full command, while the UN role would be confined to providing technical and logistical assistance to the AU mission." No dates had been agreed for the deployment of the UN forces.Egeland said that the delay would cause the situation to become infinitely worse and would prevent the ingress of humanitarian aid to the millions affected.According to National Grid and NYSEG during an afternoon press conference, at least 300,000 people and businesses are still without power as the City of Buffalo, New York begins to clean up after the worst October lake effect snow storm in "137 years of records" being kept, according to the National Weather Service. The NOAA calls the weather event "unprecedented." Power in many areas may not be fixed until early next week. Electric crews from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania have been called in to assist in the clean-up efforts, but power to many areas may not be fully restored until next weekend.BBC News is reporting "up to 267,000 gallons (one million litres)" of crude oil has leaked from a pipeline in the Prudhoe Bay oilfield. Although not as large as the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, this is thought to be the largest spill on record affecting the Alaska North Slope.The Alaska Wilderness League reports that there is "no confirmation" of the quantity of oil lost; but it points out that it is not only the oil that causes problems. The cleanup efforts will also have environmental impacts.The Associated Press first reported this spill on 2 March.On Wednesday, Captain Chesley Sullenberger retired.  The US Airways pilot was best known for the "Miracle on the Hudson," when he landed Flight 1549 safely down on the Hudson River on January 15, 2009.  After a bird strike in which both engines were blown out, Sullenberger was forced to land the plane, which carried 150 passengers, safely down on the river.  With help from the crew and first responders on scene, all those on the plane survived with minimal injuries.  Following the near disaster, many people hailed Sullenberger as a hero.  Over the past year, he has been involved in writing a book, giving speeches, and appearing before Congress. During his testimony before Congress, he spoke about the importance of pilot safety. He also served as the grand marshal of the 2010 Tournament of Roses Parade. Sullenberger was additionally hailed at the Obama inauguration and Super Bowl XLIV.  On his final flight, Sullenberger flew from Fort Lauderdale to Charlotte.  His co-pilot on the flight, Jeff Skiles, had been with him on Flight 1549.  Sullenberger was joined on the flight by his wife, Lorrie, and five passengers from Flight 1549.  Sullenberger said in a statement, that he will continue to work as an advocate for aviation safety.A fatal series of mudslides have caused hundreds of deaths in the South East Asian nation of the Philippines. They were triggered by super typhoon Durian's torrential rains as the runoff flowed down the slopes of the Mount Mayon volcano, according to witnessesRivers of mud and volcanic ash have swamped settlements in the eastern region of the country, according to officials. At least 388 people have been confirmed dead, according to the Agence France-Presse.Initial fears that the combination of storm damage and flood waters might produce a "toxic soup" in downtown New Orleans have been downplayed by experts in environmental science.  While the threat of cholera, typhoid and other diseases is certainly increased by the contamination of the flood waters with sewage and corpses, many of the chemical companies located in or near New Orleans survived the storm without spilling dangerous contaminants into the flood waters. Of course, care should be taken to not ingest any of the flood water.  People with open wounds wading or swimming through the water may also be at risk of disease.Experts at Louisiana State University said that sediments in the Mississippi River and Lake Ponchartrain are not heavily polluted and that the biggest risk of chemical contamination will come when the flood waters recede, leaving shallow pools where the water can evaporate, concentrating heavier chemical pollutants.The widespread damage caused by the flooding is actually one of the factors in reducing the contamination, since the large amounts of water have diluted many of the contaminants. Most of the chemical pollutants that were released were of low quantity, including gasoline from underground storage tanks, dry cleaning solvents, and household and small-scale industrial chemicals, such as cleaning agents.In the aftermath of the bush fires around Perth the Western Australian government has offered a $A200,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of an arsonist.Premier Alan Carpenter, who is visiting the area of the Dwellingup fires said, "It is almost inconceivable that anybody could be so stupid and so criminally, willfully damaging to the community as to go about setting a fire deliberately in these circumstances".Further fires were lit today near Yanchep and in John Forrest National Park both fires are believed to be deliberately lit as they had multiple ignition points. Earlier this morning the Dwellingup fire, assisted by strong easterly winds , broke containment lines and threatened the town of Coolup. Additional flareups and spot fires from embers have now been contained. This fire has burnt more then 11,000 hectares so far. Spokesman for the Department of Environment and Conservation, Murray Mitchel says that firefighters were trying to consolidate the fire in preparation for Wednesday's expected 40oC (104oF) temperatures. A fire weather warning has been issued for the south west of Western Australia.Investigators have found the black box of an Airblue flight that crashed into the Margalla Hills of Pakistan's capital city on Wednesday. The flight data recorder was also recovered Saturday morning. Airblue Flight 202 departed from Karachi, Pakistan, and was bound for the capital Islamabad when it crashed into the Margalla Hills due to bad weather conditions. All 152 people aboard, including the 6 crewmembers, were killed.Junaid Amin, the head of Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, told CNN the recorders will be sent to either Germany or France, which have the necessary resources to analyze the data. Such an investigation could take months to complete, however. The black box records communication data and technical information such as speed and altitude, as well as conversations in the airplane cockpit. It could thus help investigators determine why the plane crashed.The black boxes from an Air India flight that crashed into a valley of near the southern Indian city of Mangalore Saturday, killing 158 of the 166 onboard, have been found by investigators.  The flight data recorder was recovered late yesterday and the cockpit voice recorder was located today.At the end of Sunday, 146 of the 158 bodies have been identified, and all have been recovered.According to reports, the plane touched down at Mangalore's Bajpe airport, overshooting the touchdown point by several thousand feet; one tire did not hit the runway at all. Sudden braking occured, the airliner's wings hit a neighboring cliff, and the plane careened into a heavily forested ravine where it burst into flames.  "The plane veered off toward some trees on the side and then the cabin filled with smoke," said survivor Umer Farooq, "I got caught in some cables but managed to scramble out."  "I didn't think of anything at the time. All I knew was that I had to get out and get far away from the plane. The fire was spreading fast. Behind me I could feel other people jumping out but I didn't turn back to look," said survivor Koolikkunnu Krishnan. The black boxes record communication data, technical information such as speed, altitude, etc., as well as conversation in the airplane cockpit, which could help investigators determine why the jet crashed.  "The black box has been recovered from the crash site. It is vital in finding information about key details like the last moments of the flight and whether there was any error from the pilot's side. The box will be brought to the accident lab of the Director General of Civil Aviation in the national capital where it will be opened and to find out what exactly went wrong," reported investigators. They did not clarify which box they were refering to, but both have been recovered.The Air India Express Boeing 737-800, which had departed from Dubai of the United Arab Emirates, was bound for Mangalore in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.  The Bajpe airport has a "tabletop" runway which means it is set atop a hill surrounded by a deep gorge.  The airport, which was constructed in 2006, has seen over 32,000 successful landings since opening.  After visiting the eight survivors, Arvind Jadhav, chairman of Air India said, "My heart goes out to those who died and who lost friends and relatives."At least fourteen former paramilitary group members are dead as the result of a bus crash in Guatemala. BBC News Online reports at least 25 other paramilitaries were injured. According to the Herald Sun, at least 50 were injured in the crash.The incident happened when the bus was near the city of San Marcos. In the early hours of the morning, the bus departed from the mountain road and went into a ravine that is 50 metres (164 feet) in depth. There were approximately 60 passengers on the vehicle when the accident occurred.Injured survivors of the crash were transported to local hospitals. One of the survivors of the accident explained to the local media that "[t]he driver was going very fast and when we got to the curve his brakes failed and we went into the ravine". Rescue crews have also suggested that braking system problems were the cause of the crash. According to BBC News Online, road traffic collisions often occur on the mountainous Guatemalan roads.All of the passengers of the vehicle are participators in a reforestation project, and were travelling towards the municipality of Concepción Tutuapa to receive payment for their work on the project. The project was which was created by the government to give them employment. Previously, the military had created the group to assist in fighting against left-wing rebels during the Guatemalan Civil War.Australian transport investigators have announced they have identified a "critical safety issue" with engines fitted to the world's largest passenger airliner. Some Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, which power some Airbus A380 "superjumbos", may be prone to "fatigue cracking", which could lead to oil leakage and a fire.The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said they think this was "central to the engine failure" which occurred on a Qantas A380 on November 4, shortly after take-off from Singapore. The airline grounded all six of its fleet of A380s so they could undergo safety checks before they were put back into service. Late last month, Qantas announced the aircraft were safe and began returning them to service.The ATSB said the manufacturing fault with the Trent 900 engines "could lead to an elevated risk of fatigue crack initiation and growth, oil leakage and potential catastrophic engine failure from a resulting oil fire." The agency urged Rolls-Royce to "address the safety issue and take actions necessary to ensure the safety of flight operations in transport aircraft equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 series engines."Qantas emphasised on Thursday that there was "no immediate risk to flight safety," but said they would conduct further investigations. A statement from the airline said: "Qantas currently has two A380 aircraft in operational service, following the grounding of the fleet on 4 November. Both A380 aircraft will be inspected at the Qantas Jet Base in Sydney. Inspections will commence this afternoon." Two other airlines use A380 aircraft with Trent engines, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines; Singapore Airlines said they were checking the engines of their A380s "on a daily basis". They said: "The new checks advised by the ATSB will be carried out as quickly as possible."The incident in Singapore was embarrassing for Airbus. Aviation journalist Tom Ballantyne said the incident in Singapore was "certainly the most serious incident that the A380 has experienced since it entered operations." The A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007, and is now in service with several other airlines, including Air France and Emirates. It is the largest commercial passenger airliner in the world, with an 840-passenger maximum capacity, though Qantas' can carry 450.The fire is one of three that ignited yesterday in the Mojave Desert and San Gabriel Mountains. The first was a 30-acre fire that began to the west of Lancaster in the Fairmont area. It was contained and suppressed by mid-afternoon, but the other two fires ignited while firefighters were battling the first. The second fire, the "Briggs Fire", began shortly after 2:00 pm near 8334 Soledad Canyon Road and Briggs Road, south of the freeway. It burned 500 acres south of the 14 Freeway, but the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) now has it contained, and firefighters are hopeful that it will burn itself out as it edges closer to the 160,577-acre burn area of last year's Station Fire. The third fire, the "Crown Fire", broke out at around the same time as the Briggs Fire on the northern side of the 14 Freeway near Acton. The Crown fire has so far burned 13,000 acres and has been heading north into Leona Valley and Palmdale.Over 800 firefighters are now tackling the Crown Fire on the ground, Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fixed-wing aircraft have taken to the skies to drop Phos-Chek slurry (a red powdery fire retardant that is a mixture of mostly water and fertilizer, and doesn't evaporate) on the fire, and modified Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters known as "Firehawks" are making water-drops. As well as LACFD, firefighters from Los Angeles City Fire Department, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) are also helping to battle the fire. Weather conditions and topography have hindered their efforts, as temperatures rose to 98 degrees Fahrenheit today, with windspeeds of 25mph. Tonight, the National Weather Service predicts winds will reach as high as 50mph.The fire burned down a Los Angeles County Sheriff Department communications tower, forcing Lancaster and Palmdale-based deputies to set up mobile operations bases and coordinate their efforts using cell phones and computers. Last night, the California Aqueduct acted as a barrier to the fire.Residents of Leona Valley, Lake Elizabeth, Ritter Ranch, Rancho Vista, Ana Verde and Palmdale received Reverse 911 telephone calls last night alerting them of mandatory evacuations. Many of the evacuation orders were lifted this morning as the spread of the fire decreased. However, as winds picked up in the afternoon, fire embers were carried across the aqueduct and the fire is now heading towards a highly-populated area of Palmdale. Residents who were allowed back into their homes were re-evacuated to Red Cross shelters set up in local schools and parks.The fire is also threatening five high-voltage power lines that supply electricity to much of Southern California. 21 customers in the immediate vicinity have been without power since yesterday.At 5:00 pm, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, police and fire officials held a press conference. The governor said that the fire was 20% contained and had burned 13,000 acres. It is thought that the fire began when workers in Agua Dulce caused sparks by hammering the bolts when they were removing a tire from a rim.The Haitian cholera outbreak has killed 292 people and infected over 4000, according to the Haitian government, although there are no new cases in the earthquake ravaged capital, Port-au-Prince. Neighboring countries, Dominican Republic and Jamaica have begun to implement measures to prevent the disease from spreading.The Deputy Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Jon Andrus said, "health aides are in Haitian camps, educating people about proper food, water and waste treatment." He also added that "the goal is to provide 24-hours-a-day medical care." The United Nations (UN) is calling the cholera outbreak "extremely serious" and it would be "irresponsible to plan for anything but a considerably wider outbreak." A United Nations spokesperson also expressed concerned that the disease might become more widespread. Members of CARE medical teams have been working non-stop to treat the sick, but the number of people who need treatment still remain high. Although no cases of the disease have been reported in the Dominican Republic or Jamaica, the countries are beefing up their defenses. The Jamaican Prime Minister, Bruce Golding, said yesterday that the coast guard have increased their high seas patrols to prevent individuals infected with the disease from fleeing to the country. He also added that "we must all ensure that we practise good hygiene, wash our hands with soap regularly, drink only boiled water or bottled water." Golding informed the cabinet that the Ministry of Health has begun to beef up operations in select towns which are still suffering from high waters due to the passage of Tropical Storm Nicole. In the Dominican Republic health officials are present and are currently putting measures in place to prevent the disease from spreading over to the country. These include tight border control and bans on cooked or raw food from Haiti.NASA has stated that a three inch gouge has been found in the heat shield on one of Space Shuttle Endeavour's wings. The gouge was spotted as the shuttle approached the International Space Station (ISS) and captured on camera by ISS astronauts.According to NASA, the gouge was found on a six-inch thick tile on the starboard wing of the heat shield and that it may have been caused by ice and not foam. NASA is worried because the hole appears to be deep."What does this mean? I don’t know at this point. There are three prongs to our assessment, first we will conduct a thermal analysis based on the damage, check the flight history and test the area. We would never take it lightly to send astronauts to the underside of the vehicle to do anything," said the mission management team chairman, John Shannon who also said that until the damage is inspected, "it's way too early to determine whether any repairs are required."If the damage is found to be irreversible and cannot be fixed, the crew of Endeavour would stay on the ISS. NASA says that supplies would last until a rescue mission could be launched October 8 by sending up Discovery.During lift off of Endeavour on August 8, cameras had shown moisture which had gathered on the camera's lens, but NASA states that the object which caused the damage was not caught on camera. At least nine pieces of debris were reported to have been filmed while the shuttle took off, but NASA says that only three of those pieces of debris had a possibility of hitting the shuttle.Astronauts are expected to use a laser that is attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to measure the exact depth and size of the gouge on Sunday. The tile could be repaired by affixing a metal plate over the tile, filling it with putty, or sealing the gouge.Poland has rejected a Russian investigative report into the air crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczyński earlier this year. Poland's first couple and other senior officials were among the 96 killed when their aircraft went down near Smolensk, Russia. On Friday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called an unreleased draft he has seen "unacceptable" and its conclusions "without foundation".Tusk's televised remarks to the press did not reveal what the report contains, but claimed it to be in breach of the Chicago Convention, an international regulatory document on air travel. "From the Polish point of view, the draft report from the Russian side as it has been sent is without question unacceptable. This negligence and mistakes or lack of positive reaction to what Poland has been asking for, all these things allow us to say that some of the report's conclusions are without foundation," he said.Edmund Klich, who heads the Polish air accident investigatory body, has seen the report and blamed elements in both Russia and Poland. Klich said the Polish military pilots had been insufficiently trained and ignored safety, and that Russian air traffic controllers should have diverted the aircraft elsewhere. Visibility had deteriorated at Smolensk's airport prior to the crash, but the Tupolev Tu-154's pilots were determined to get the President through the fog so he could attend a ceremony commemorating the Katyn massacre. Stalin had ordered Polish prisoners there to be killed during the Second World War."I believe the Polish side bears more responsibility," Klich commented, "but of course the Russians had their shortcomings." He has previously criticised Russia's failure to provide air traffic control transcripts from the disaster, which left no survivors. Also on Friday, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman told Ekho Moskvy Russia is ready to answer Polish questions. He reiterated a need to co-operate and added it is "important not to politicize the situation." Russian President Dmitry Medvedev also repeated calls for co-operation on a visit to Poland last week.The comments follow the delivery of the draft to Poland by the Interstate Aviation Committee last month following complaints Russia should speed up the investigation. The crash has caused political controversy in Poland, with the newly-elected President and first lady belonging to Civic Platform, who were Kaczyński's opposition.The Wall Street Journal suggests Tusk's remarks may damage improving relations between the countries. Conservative elements within Poland already doubted the veracity of improved relations and have formed conspiracy theories around the crash, citing a perception the Polish government will blindly accept whatever Russian investigators say.One person is dead and 13 others, including 5 members of the Garda Síochána, Ireland's police force, are injured following the pursuit of a stolen bus throughout the south of Dublin city and county. A driver who was not authorised to take the vehicle early in the morning of May 7 stole the coach from the yard of private hire operator Dualway. The bus was later located at Dublin Heuston railway station by the coach company, where the driver attempted to run over the son of the owner of Dualway.The driver then returned to the Dualway depot in Rathcoole in what developed in to a high speed pursuit involving up to 20 patrol cars and a police helicopter. The Gardaí fired several shots at the driver's tires in an attempt to stop the car, as well as laying tacks. The bus was driven down the wrong side of the N7 Naas road, where it collided with a number of cars, killing a female driver, and rammed five Garda patrol cars that were blocking the road. The driver was apprehended and arrested at the Dualway depot after crashing the bus.Sections of the N7 as well as surrounding roads were closed following the incident for forensic examinations, and the Luas tram services were severely curtailed.An aging ferry deemed unsafe sank in the Red Sea on Friday with about 1400 people on board, mostly Egyptians who travel back and forth to Saudi Arabia to work as guest workers.Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's spokesman, Suleiman Awad, said there were not enough lifeboats, and questions were raised about the safety of the old ship that had 220 cars on it as well as the passengers.  "The speed with which the ship sank and the lack of sufficient lifeboats indicate there was some deficiency," Awad said."It's a roll-on, roll-off ferry, and there is big question mark over the stability of this kind of ship," said David Osler of Lloyds List. "It would only take a bit of water to get on board this ship and it would be all over. ... The percentage of this type of ferry involved in this type of disaster is huge."Tens of thousands of poor Egyptians work in Persian Gulf countries for years to earn money. They travel by ship as it is a cheaper option than flying.Reports say that the amount of people fleeing from their homes in California located in the United States due to wildfires has reached the 1,000,000 mark as the fires continue to grow. More than 500,000 people have been ordered to evacuate areas of Southern California as firefighters have began to realize that they may not be able to put all the fires out.45 people have been injured, 21 of those being firefighters battling the blazes. At least one person was reported to have been killed earlier, but so far those reports cannot be confirmed."If it's this big and blowing with as much wind as it's got, it'll go all the way to the ocean before it stops ... We can save some stuff but we can't stop it," said captain of the San Diego fire department, Kirk Humphries.Yesterday, U.S. President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency in California, clearing the way for the state to begin receiving federal aid assistance."All of us across this nation are concerned for the families who have lost their homes and the many families who have been evacuated from their homes. We send the help of the federal government," said Bush in a statement to the press.The Santa Ana winds have been blowing for three days and they are not forecast to stop for the next day or so.Close to 2,000 homes are burned to ashes and nearly 70,000 more are believed to be at a high risk of catching fire. Almost 400,000 acres of land have been scorched with 18 fires burning.Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency Service reported that a blaze which started Thursday outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia in Canada was brought under control by Friday afternoon with the help of a rainstorm Friday morning."If we didn't have the rain, this fire may not be under control," Lloyd Currie, a spokesman for the Halifax Regional Fire Service said. "We're happy that we're having this rain. We just need more of it."Hurricane Juan in 2003 produced downed trees and brush to fuel this year's fire which spread through the area at 36 metres (118 feet) per minute. On Thursday, the fire was settling down, but when high winds fanned the blaze, the fire surged out of control, creating flames 15 meters (49.2 ft) high which leapt from treetop to treetop.Between 800 to 1,200 hectares (2,000 to 3,000 acres) of forest were destroyed, as were eight homes. Another ten homes were also damaged as high winds fanned the flames through the district. Police are investigating a possible case of arson during the brushfire when residents were evacuating.File:HalifaxRegionalMunicipalityMap.GIFOver 100 firefighters and five helicopters were out fighting the fire.People were awakened from their sleep at three a.m. local time to report into the Red Cross evacuation centre. Residents reported driving through flames in their home driveways to escape the brush fire. On Wednesday, firefighters thought a fire in the same district was under control. Currie feels that the Thursday wildfire was a separate fire distinct from the one started on Wednesday.“We warned the people as fast as we could,” said Currie.  Altogether about 1,100 persons were displaced because of the fire and about 500 homes were abandoned.Peter Kelly, Mayor of Halifax toured the devastation by air. “It's a shock. Where homes used to be they are no longer.  It's surreal for me,” he said.On Friday no flames were visible, but hot spots remained.Halifax Regional Municipality, with a population of 282,924 in 2006, is the capital of the province of Nova Scotia.1.4 million people have been evacuated on the mainland of China because of a deadly storm. The Xinhua News Agency reported Typhoon Krosa struck China's Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, before weakening to a tropical storm. The storm made landfall around 0730 GMT, with winds of up to 126 km/hour.Severe structural damage and power outages have been reported in the port city of Wenzhou. Among the evacuated were 500,000 tourists who were at coastal resorts for the National Day holiday. Xinhua also said that 75,000 fishing vessels have been ordered to return to their ports.Taiwan's Disaster Relief Center reported that Krosa killed at least 5 people and knocked out power to another 2 million when it made landfall as a Category 4 typhoon.Ten American soldiers were killed when a CH-47 Chinook helicopter crashed near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border close to a landing zone in the Kunar province. A military spokesman said it crashed while conducting combat operations. The Soldiers were involved with Operation Mountain Lion, which is aimed at rooting out al-Qaeda and former Taliban militants."The remains of all the 10 soldiers have been found and there are no survivors. There is no indication that the helicopter came down due to some enemy action. Additional aircraft and crews were also at the landing zone and confirmed that enemy forces did not cause the crash," said Lt. Tamara D. Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military.However; Muhamad Hanif, a Taliban spokesman, said that the crash was the result of the Taliban. He also said that advanced weaponry was used to shoot down helicopters."We have no indication that that happened," said Lawrence in response to Hanif's claim. "The crash occurred in a very mountainous terrain and the landing zone was very difficult. It was a mountain-top landing zone. There were various weather factors that could have come into play…. There were high winds. We are investigating any possible causes for the accident but there were no enemy actions detected at the scene," she added.In June of 2005, Taliban forces brought down a Chinook in the same province, which killed all American soldiers onboard. According to the military, rocket-propelled grenades were used in that attack.There are at least 20,000 coalition forces in Afghanistan; 18,000 of them are American soldiers. At least 2,500 of the American soldiers are also involved with Operation Mountain Lion.Ten people have been arrested over a school fire in Uganda over possible negligence on their parts. The news comes as the death toll in the fire reaches 20 schoolgirls. Earlier reports also say two adults died, but later sources make no mention of this.Police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba said the matron of the dormitory that caught fire and the guards at the Budo girl's school were arrested, but provided no details of their alleged role in the April 14 disaster. However, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni previously commented that there are "signs that there was negligence by the school administration." Nabakooba also announced a police reward of US$3,000 for more information on the blaze, although it is unclear if the value was given in Ugandan shillings or if the dollar is being used as an alternative currency.58 girls are thought to have been in the dorm at the time, which had been locked from the outside. Some mannaged to escape by wriggling through narrow windows. By the time fire services reached the scene, 15 kilometres from Kampala, most of the dorm had already been desroyed by the intense fire.It has been suggested by police that the fire may have been a vengeful act of arson, based on preliminary investigations, mainly interviews with eyewitnesses to the fire. Police Inspector General Kale Kaihura described the initial indications as pointing to "homicide".A Friday prayer service for the victims, spoken at by Anglican Bishop Samuel Balagadde Sekadde, was attended by thousands. Sekradde spoke of an act of heroism by 10-year-old Yvonne Namaganda, who was able to rescue six of her fellows before poisnonous fumes overcame her upon her return for a seventh.Exactly ten years on from her death hundreds of people attended a memorial service today led by her two sons, William and Harry, in memory of Diana, who was killed in a car crash in Paris, France in 1997.The memorial service was led by her two sons and was attended by many members of the British Royal Family including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and Prince Charles, Diana's brother and sisters and others including Andrew Lloyd Webber, former UK prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major and entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson. Hundreds more listened to the ceremony broadcast live outside. There was also a period of two minutes of silence in Harrods, the London department store owned by Mohammed al Fyaed, father of Diana's partner at the time of the crash Dodi, to pay respect.During the ceremony Harry called his mother "the best in the world" and the Bishop of London, Reverend Dr Richard Chartres, said that Diana should now be left to "rest in peace" and that the media speculation and conspiracy theories should end.The second inquiry into the circumstances of the fatal crash is due to commence in the coming weeks.11 people have been left dead and thousands have no electricity after a snowstorm hit the central area of the United States. Hundreds of flights were also cancelled. A pile-up on Interstate 40, Texas caused one death and two life-threatening injuries. Hundreds of trees and power lines have also fallen across Chicago, Wisconsin, Texas, Kansas and Minnesota.In Wisconsin there were three fatalities from the snow storm, while one died in both Kansas and Texas. These deaths were caused from road accidents which arose from the storm.At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, 300 flights have been cancelled due to the storm, which is expected to move north to the area near the great lakes. Winds were at speeds of 50 to 68 mph in the Chicago Area.In many areas visibility was lowered to almost zero by the storms.The death in Texas was expected to have involved over 40 vehicles and about 20 semitrailers. The accident involved many families, some going on a holiday for the festive season.Three deaths were also caused by a traffic-related incident in Minnesota.In addition, there were reports of children not wearing clothing appropriate to the weather conditions. The type of storm that hit America today is not uncommon at this period in Winter. Authorities have the capability to deal with this type of extreme weather, to the extent that damage is lessened but not completely prevented.Eleven people have died after a military helicopter crashed during an anti-narcotics flight in Western Mexico. The Bell 212 went down near Uruapan in Michoacan.Michoacan is a major area in Mexico's anti-narcotics operations, which are conducted by the nation's military. The rotorcraft went down around midday. Police cordoned off the scene and forensic officers have moved in to examine the site. The Defense Department is investigating.A statement by the military confirmed the crash. "There are 11 men dead, including a colonel, and one soldier was injured," said a state attorney general's office spokesman. The wounded soldier, who was the sole survivor, was flown to a Mexico City military hospital, and remains there in a serious condition.Although authorities released no crash details, witnesses say the helicopter lost power during attempts to land. "The motor stopped and the helicopter plummeted to the ground," said one local resident named Agustin Vargas. The flight had been headed to a marijuana field with the intention of raiding it.The Indonesian government has ordered the evacuation of 11,000 people form the Magelang district as Mount Merapi spews ash, lava and smoke from its dome. The dome continues to rise and scientists fear it may collapse. Smoke and ash are rising at least 2.4 miles into the sky and lava is rising at least 4 miles from the volcano's crater."Of course it is dangerous. But we don't know for sure whether the lava dome will collapse," said an Indonesian government volcanologist, Subandriyo.At least 40 cars and trucks have been ordered to assist in the evacuation and take villagers to nearby schools and government buildings that have been turned into makeshift shelters."Since Monday we have evacuated ... more or less 2,000 people. The people that we need to evacuate are around 11,000. The lava has spread out in various directions. The lava domes are weakening," said Edi Purwanto, who is in charge of the evacuation post. Scientists also say that the recent earthquake on May 27 which had a magnitude of 6.3 may have caused the volcano to become unstable and likely "shook the mountain." At least 5,800 people were killed in the quake."I don't think that's unreasonable. The volcano is an unstable pile of rock. It's fragile. I would be surprised if it [the quake] didn't literally shake the mountain," said an Arizona State University volcanologist who studies the volcano, Stanley Williams.The volcano sits 280 miles to the east of Indonesia's capital of Jakarta.According to many news sources including CNN and USA Today, reports indicate that 12 coal miners have been found dead in the mine in Sago, West Virginia and only one has survived, reversing reports three hours earlier that 12 had been found alive -- a report that had caused celebration amongst family members and friends.  The family members of the dead miners were notified of the deaths by Ben Hatfield, CEO of the International Coal Groi[, at the Sago Baptist Church. Hatfield blamed the reversal on "bad information" and "miscommunication." "What happened is that through stray cell phone conversations it appears that this miscommunication from the rescue team underground to the command center was picked up by various people that simply overheard the conversation that was relayed over cell phone communications without our ever having made a [public news] release," explained Hatfield.Family members walked out of the church saying that the CEO of the mining company had "lied to them". The surviving miner, Randal McCloy, is currently in critical condition at Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia.The United States Mine Safety and Health Administration issued the mine 208 citations last year, an increase from 68 reported in 2004. Federal regulations cover concerns over accumulations of combustible materials, including methane gas and coal dust from loose coal, in addition to other safety issues. The agency has announced that it plans launch a in-depth investigation into the incident at Sago. The investigation will examine the mine's compliance with health and safety standards and how emergency information was communicated.At least 12 people have died and 32 have been injured because of a human stampede in the night club News Divine in Mexico City, Mexico.

The establishment's owner, Alfredo Maya Ortiz, told those in the club to leave due to the authorities' appearance.The Secretaría de Seguridad Pública (Public Safety, SSP) police officers arrived at the club at 5pm after being informed of alcohol sales to minors. During the raid, Ortiz used the sound system to make an announcement asking everyone to evacuate. Everyone did so simultaneously.Three minors are confirmed dead following the incident, as are six teenagers between 18 and 22 years old and three policemen. Some of the victims lost their lives because they were flattened by the doors being opened. Others perished after falling to the floor and getting trampled by the stampede. There were a number of deaths due to cars unintentionally running over people. All bodies were moved to the GAM 5 territorial coordination."Everybody began to run to the door desperately, in that moment somebody fell to the floor; others where arrested by the police when they crossed the door. Some of them where hit and moved to some buses. When they [the police] weren't looking at us, I took one of my friends and started to run", said a reserved source. He or she also confirmed that drugs were sold there and the club was only a "small two-story club that was always crowded".In addition to the owner, club employee Mariana de la Cruz Gayoso and an unidentified person have been arrested. The head of SSP, Joel Ortega Cuevas, confirmed the destitution of the policemen who organized the raid in order to optimize the investigation.News Divine has been open for three years and in that time has been closed three times by the law. Most recently, it was closed earlier this year. There have been many reports and complaints of drug sales, fights, and aggression around the club.In San Luis de La Balsa, Costa Rica a tourist bus carrying foreign tourist flipped over in the highway about 55 miles Northeast of the capital of San Jose.

According to the Aviation Safety Network, last year Africa accounted for just 3% of all airliner flights, but also accounted for 18.5% of all fatal accidents in the commercial aviation sector. Mining flights in particular have caused safety concerns, with officials banning flights into Goma from Walikale, also in Kivu, in June. Prior to the ban, aircraft had been using a stretch of road as a temporary runway while a purpose-built one was being constructed.Thirteen people have died in Russia after two accidents, one with an airplane and one with a helicopter.An Antonov An-12 cargo airplane crashed early Sunday morning in the Moscow airport Domodedovo, leaving no survivors. According to a spokesperson of the Ministry of Emergencies, the airplane "fell four kilometres (2.5 miles) from the runway and caught fire.

The flight originated in Iquitos, capital of the region, and had flown on to Orellana, where it had just taken off from when the accident occurred.Survivors said after the crash that they had attempted to persuade the pilot not to takeoff in the adverse weather conditions, but they had been assured by Air Force personnel that they would be safe as they were on board a military aircraft.Survivor Juan Saavedra said that, on takeoff, the pilot immediately began struggling to control the plane in high winds. It then dropped and flew between two trees, shearing off its wings. Another survivor said that immediately prior to the crash the pilot gave an order to turn off the engine in a move that is speculated to have been intended to prevent a post-impact fire.Local officials said 20 people were on board, with police giving seven survivors and the Defence Ministry eight. No passenger list or official report has yet been released regarding the crash, but it is known that 13 bodies were recovered from the wreckage. Juan Montes, a police spokesman in the jungle village Contamana, supposed to be the aircraft's next stop, said that the plane had a three-man crew, all of whom were killed.Maria Luisa Armas, 93, the oldest resident of Contamana, is reported by survivors to have survived initially but insisted that other survivors leave her in the aircraft and go off to find help. She was one of the 13 deceased ultimately pulled out of the wreckage.The survivors were taken to Pucallpa, which was supposed to be the last stop on the flight.According to the state news agency, Andina, homes had been deroofed and trees felled by powerful winds earlier the same day.The United States military has confirmed that all 13 U.S. soldiers aboard a U.S. Blackhawk military helicopter were killed when it crashed near Baghdad, Iraq."A U.S. forces helicopter went down northeast of Baghdad ...

Thirteen passengers and crew members were aboard the aircraft and all were killed," said a statement issued by the U.S. military.The cause of the crash is not known and an investigation has been launched, but witnesses near the crash have stated that the helicopter was hit with a "rocket" or another form of a "projectile" and was in flames while flying in the air, before it crashed. CNN reported January 22 that anonymous members of the American defence have confirmed that the helicopter was shot down."I'm not sure if it was a rocket or other projectiles. After the helicopter was fired upon it was obvious that it was losing control. Then it crashed with an explosion and the smoke started," said a farmer who witnessed the crash.

The Indian army dispatched troops and helicopters to the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to rescue people stranded by the flooding. They also delivered emergency medical supplies and food provisions. Hundreds of thousands of people have already been evacuated out of the vicinity.The rains damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, the authorities have said. The waters have also ruined crops, blocked roads, and disrupted communication links. The death toll is expected to rise as search teams reach areas previously rendered inaccessible.The Chief Minister of Karnataka, B. S. Yeddyurappa, said that the current situation was "serious". "We have asked for more helicopters from the Indian Air Force to help us," he told media.Chief Minister K. Rosaiah said that army personnel had dispatched to assist with rescue efforts. "Six chopper [sic] have been pressed into service to immediately rescue people. While four helicopters are being used to airlift the flood-hit people in Kurnool district, two choppers were deployed in Mahabubnagar district. A helicopter rescued 15 people in the pilgrim town of Mantralayam," he said.Weather analysts have said that the intense rains come from a storm in the Bay of Bengal. "India's monsoon season usually brings rains from June and withdraws by the end of September. But, this year some parts of the country were actually drought affected due to inadequate and untimely rainfall. Moreover, the cyclone in the Bay of Bengal did the damage in south India which is battling floods after rivers breached their banks. This is a calamity. The central government is also closely monitoring the situation," said Professor D.K. George, a weather specialist.The Indian Meterological Department has said it expects more heavy rains over the next day in the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.Bushfires across the Australian state of Victoria have killed at least 108 people and have destroyed dozens of homes. These fires were caused by a severe heat wave affecting the country, combined with winds reported to have reached gale force. According to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the fires have burned approximately 30,000 acres (12,140 hectares) of land since they began on Friday. State police officials stated that there are still several more fires being fought, and feared that the death toll could reach as much as double the currently confirmed number when all fires are extinguished and investigations begin.Temperatures in Victoria today reached 46° Celsius (115° Fahrenheit), with the combination of temperatures and high winds helped to fuel the fires. The fire was reported to be moving at an estimated 60 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour). "This has been an absolute tragedy for the state and we believe this figure may only get worse. We're concerned this figure could even reach up into the 40s," stated Kieran Walshe, the Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner, referring to the death toll."The whole of Kinglake is ablaze, I live a couple of kilometers out of town, I heard explosions, by the time I got to the road there were fires everywhere. [There is] flame everywhere, trees exploding, gas tanks exploding, buildings on fire, it's very, very, very serious," said a resident of Kinglake, a small township north of Melbourne that was greatly affected by the flames. "I can't quite see down into the main stretch of town, but there's a lot of flame coming up from there, so I presume most of the town is going up," he also stated. Kinglake has had the most deaths in the fire outbreak so far, where it was reported that six people traveling in a car were all killed when it was set ablaze by the raging flames.Over 30,000 volunteers are currently fighting the blazes across the country, along with the help of helicopters and aircraft dropping chemicals and water onto the site hoping to help extinguish the fire. Greg Esnouf, the Victoria Country Fire Authority deputy chief, stated that conditions for firefighters were "off the scale" dangerously, and also stated that the forecast for Sunday would not be different than the previous few days.Victoria Police have reported that they are suspecting that some of the fires were lit through arson, and are currently in the process of questioning a resident about a fire that started outside of the city. Another man was arrested in connection with deliberately lighting the fire, but was released by police and had arson charges dropped. According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the heat wave is expected to continue throughout the weekend and peaking in the southeastern part of the country, with temperatures not expected to get cooler until early next week."According to our latest information, 14 people died -- the driver of the truck and 13 people on the bus," said a spokeswoman for the Emergency Ministry. The crash occurred in Petushinsky, a district 100 kilometres (60 miles) to Moscow's east.The crash occurred on the Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod-Ufa highway, and the death toll may yet rise as the burnt-out wreckage makes identifications difficult. The death toll has already been revised from 25. A criminal investigation has been launched regarding possible violations of traffic laws.It is unclear where the vehicles were going. Reports suggest both were headed towards Moscow. It is thought that the truck left its lane and crossed into the path of the bus.14 people were injured after a bus carrying 39 students and five chaperones veered off the road and into a ditch South of Quebec City before overturning at about 9:30 p.m. local time yesterday evening. The bus was about 45 minutes from the city, close to the town of St. Patrice de BeaurivageThe bus was returning to the city with students from a day trip to watch the manufacture of maple syrup. 12 students and two chaperones spent the night in hospital, with the most serious injury being a broken collarbone suffered by a chaperone, who remained in hospital.

The head of the middle school described the students as "resilient" and as having "high spirits", and said that "they bounce back really quickly.".Councillors were made available to parents and students.It is thought the accident occurred when the driver lost control in a heavy storm. Ann Mathieu, a provincial police spokeswoman, said the weather at the time of the crash "was very, very rainy and the visibility was not too good." She said the crash happened when the bus skidded and the driver swerved to try to keep it on the road, causing it instead to overturn. She also said that charges are unlikely as a result of the incident and that no mechanical problems could be found with the bus. She told reporters that neither alcohol nor excessive speed were factors in the accident. The bus is thought to originate from Massachusetts as it has a Massachusetts license plate.At least 14 United States troops, four crew and ten passengers, were killed in Iraq when their UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed, for unknown reasons. The U.S. military in Iraq are blaming mechanical failure for the crash. One other helicopter was flying with the downed one on a mission the military calls Task Force Lightning."There were no indications of hostile fire.

The boy, who was unnamed due to his age, was a passenger on board Southwest Airlines Flight 284 from Los Angeles to Nashville on Tuesday, with his parents reporting him missing at 11:30 am the same day. Although he remained calm throughout the flight and made no hijacking attempt, authorities report he had handcuffs, duct tape and yarn inside the aircraft cabin with him. Although his arrest was only made public on Friday, it is reported that he was detained immediately on reaching Nashville International Airport.George Bolds, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that the items were "suspicious" and that the boy had informed the FBI he had indeed intended to hijack the aircraft. An FBI agent told reporters that he felt the plot was ill-conceived, saying "His plan had a low probability of success."The FBI also conducted a search of his home on Thursday, finding in his room "a photograph of the inside of a small aircraft, something you'd find in a bookstore."Subsequent to his arrest he pled guilty on Friday to a "delinquent act," according to local officials. A juvenile court judge ordered him to be returned to California for continued perusal of that charge as well as others set to be made. He is currently in Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center in Nashville.Authorities believe that the teen was suicidal, but the FBI dismissed earlier reports alleging that he intended to crash the airliner into a Hannah Montana concert in Lafayette, Louisiana.A 66-inch (168 centimeter) water main has been reported broken at River Road and Bradley Boulevard in Bethesda Maryland, a suburb of Washington D.C.The Montgomery County Police in Maryland stated that they received a call at 7:55 local time (12:55 GMT) about a water main break. A spokesman for the Montgomery County fire department stated that no less than twelve people have been rescued by boat and helicopters from their automobiles after being stranded by the flooding. At least two cars were trapped, one of which turned over with a person inside. The rescue effort was made more difficult because the gushing water was moving so quickly.No major injuries have been reported, although several people have been treated for frostbite, a result of the -6 centigrade (21 Fahrenheit) temperatures at the time.Raj Bhansaly, a witness to the disaster, commented on what he saw: "I thought it might be a minor leak, then suddenly I stepped outside and, my God. It looked literally like the Potomac river."The road is reported to be thoroughly flooded; drivers are advised to seek alternate routes. Both Bradley Boulevard and River Road are closed for the time being.At least seventeen people were killed on Sunday after a river ferry in Cambodia capsized in a tributary of the Mekong river.The ferry, with 30 people onboard, was travelling to a ceremony at a Buddhist temple.

Many of those who escaped the mines are suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. Since the accident, there has been no contact with the 170 workers trapped inside, although the initial number of 183 people still in the complex was revised downwards.China has had a long history of mining accidents —its mines are known as being among the most dangerous in the world. Last month, more than 150 people died after a gas explosion in a mine in the Henan province. The official tally of 4,153 mine fatalities during the first nine months of this year is actually a 13% improvement over the same period last year, which had a total of 6,246 mine worker deaths —4,620 of them coal mines. 5,203 deaths occurred among workers in other China industries.1700 runners running in the Original Mountain Marathon, a fell running event, are still unaccounted for the day after they were stranded by flooding.Approximately 2000 people entered the race, and rescue teams have resumed their search for the missing.The disruption of the event that occurred at the top of one of the highest mountains in the Borrowdale Valley (a region of the UK's Lake District) , and the people found have sought refuge at local buildings and businesses. Three hundred of the people found have sheltered in the nearby Honister Slate Mine."The weather is absolutely horrendous and it's a scene of chaos up here," stated Mark Weir, the owner of the slate mines. "I believe there were up to about two thousand people who entered this race and I advised the organizers not to go ahead with the event.""The mountain rescue teams are still trying to account for everyone," added Weir. "We have had people coming in throughout the day in pretty bad states. They are dripping wet through and very cold. Our staff is helping to transport them off the mountain pass and down to Cocker mouth where the emergency services are taking over. But we need more help and more buses as there are still plenty of people up here."Organizers of the run have stressed that the runners should be fully equipped with tents and food, allowing them to survive in the place where they are stranded.High winds and multiple tornadoes caused destruction across the American Midwest yesterday, killing 18 people when they hit five states in the early evening, although that figure is expected to rise.In Dyer County, Tennessee alone, 12 people were killed, and in Gibson County, Tennessee, a further three were lost, bringing the death toll up to 15 in that state alone. The remaining three lives were lost in Missouri as a result of high winds, although the freak weather also hit the states of Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois.When asked about the storms which caused chaos in Tennessee, Dyer County Sherriff Jeffrey Holt said, "This hit about 7:40 last night, so the warnings were out. They were being tracked all the way across Arkansas and Missouri as it was coming in. We had plenty of warnings, I think, just the amount of destruction in the area is what caused our fatality count to get so high. Destruction is almost absolute total destruction along some of the path of this. There's just nothing left of houses but foundation."Numerous power failures were reported across the affected areas, with some county authorities reporting that the blackouts may go on for several days.A dispatcher in Pemiscot County, Missouri informed the press that, as of Monday morning, some people were still trapped in their houses as a result of the storms.In Illinois, tornadoes touched down across at least seven counties according to local emergency officials, but no-one was severely injured or killed. The Emergency Management spokesperson for Illinois Patti Thompson reported that a large storm front which spanned the breadth of America from Illinois southwards was the cause of last night's dramatic weather.In the state of Ohio, a Wilmington-based meteorologist informed members of the Associated Press that "In every county in southwest Ohio there has been some type of damage."Repair costs for damage across the affected area are expected to be six-figure sums, and extensive work to replace destroyed segments of the infrastructure such as gas and power supplies is already underway, said officials in all seven of the states hit this morning. The current death toll is expected to rise today, with at least one more unconfirmed death reported in Missouri already.At least 18 people have been hospitalized after two students released pepper spray into a high school in Valga, Estonia.

Another biker rode into a guardrail, and others were killed on their way home.At least 190 people have been confirmed dead after heavy rains caused a river to burst its banks in the eastern Ethiopian city of Dire Dawa. A further 300 are reported missing. Rescuers have been digging all weekend with just hand tools and garden equipment, although bulldozers have also been used to shift tons of mud. Disaster management teams are expected to reach the city today. The river Dechatu flooded on Saturday night after exceptionally heavy rains. Over 200 homes were destroyed and many died instantly as their houses were swept away as they slept. Of the confirmed dead so far, nearly 40 were children. 94 people injured in the immediate aftermath were treated in hospital before returning to the remains of their homes.Regional police inspector Beniam Fikru said that some of the dead were already being buried, but identifying bodies was difficult. “Relatives are reporting that 300 people are missing,” he said, “but the search goes on.” Dire Dawa, 500km east of the capital Addis Ababa, is the country’s second largest city. While the death toll is expected to rise, over 15,000 people had been displaced from the city’s 250,000-strong population. On Friday, over 1,000 people were rescued from villages as rains swept through the south of the country. Flooding is a regular occurrence in the June-August rainy season and Dire Dawa has been struck before. 45 people were killed in the city in flash floods last summer, some reportedly by crocodiles in the floodwaters.Terry Knutsen, who performed under the name Terry Teen during the 1960s, died on Friday evening after life support systems were removed, according to sources close to the artist. Mr. Knutsen was seriously injured on Wednesday evening, while riding his bicycle along the outskirts of Tyler, Texas, United States.Doctors immediately classified Mr. Knutsen's condition as 'critical' upon his arrival at the hospital, and further stated that he never achieved notable brain activity while hospitalized. Reports indicate that Mr. Knutsen struck a tow truck while he rode his bicycle along Highway 110 along the outskirts of Tyler, Texas on Wednesday evening. A passerby describes seeing "...a smashed up bicycle covered in...plastic bags and...a yellow raincoat..." lying at the scene of the accident. Mr. Knutsen achieved some notoriety for his novelty song Curse of the Hearse, which was a staple for many years on Doctor Demento's annual Halloween radio program. Before his death, Mr. Knutsen had performed for many years throughout Texas as a professional clown. He made a brief (uncredited) appearance many years ago on one episode of the hit television show In Living Color. Sources indicate he also had minor roles in various films.A memorial service is planned for Monday evening at 7:00pm local time (CDT).A large fire in Bislig City, Philippines has left 2,000 people homeless. One person was killed, and at least 25 others injured.Peruvian highway police said that two thousand tourists have been stranded near the ruins of the ancient Machu Picchu citadel, after torrential rains caused mudslides, blocking the train route that goes from the site to Cusco.Soledad Caparo, a spokeswoman for Perurail commented that the train operator suspended service earlier today, and is trying to remove the mud that is blocking the rail.The last leg of the trip from Machu Picchu to Cusco is only possible by rail; Peruvian Tourism Minister Martin Perez remarked that the government might try to evacuate those stranded via helicopter.The Vilcanota and Rio Blanco rivers located nearby, meanwhile both have overflowed, flooding hundreds of hectares of corn crop and fifty homes, according to officials. The Cusco-Abancay highway was also blocked due to the overflowing Yanama, with vehicle traffic lining up, unable to get through. Two people were killed by the rains.A two-year-old girl was found dead inside a car yesterday in Union Township, Clermont County, Ohio The car was parked outside the Glen Este Middle School with all windows rolled up. High temperatures in the area reached 100ºF (~38ºC). Police said that the girl had been inside the car for hours before her death. A friend of the family said the child was Cecelia Slaby, however police are not reporting any personal information.The car was registered to the school's vice principal, Brenda Nesselroad-Slaby. The school staff had to report to work to prepare for the start of school next week.The family friend that identified the girl also told News 5 in Cincinnati that Nesselroad-Slaby was scheduled to attend a 7 a.m. meeting, but decided that was too early in the day to drop off Cecelia, so she ran several errands instead. The source said Cecelia likely fell asleep in the car and Nesselroad forgot about her when she did go to the school, as she usually does not care for the child in the morning. However, police have not released any specific details. The family friend described Nesselroad as "mother of the year."The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the temperature inside a closed vehicle setting in sunlight can raise nearly 20 Fahrenheit degrees (11 Celsius degrees) in just three minutes. Another three or four minutes, and the administration says a car's temperature can reach 125ºF (~52ºC). Heatstrokes occur when the body reaches a temperature of 104ºF (40ºC).No charges have been filed. An autopsy has been scheduled.A freak accident caused twenty deaths and some injuries, according to officials, at the well-known Kintampo waterfall, in Ghana, on Sunday afternoon local time. Those affected were reportedly school students from Wenchi Senior High School on a supervised trip, and several tourists, who were swimming at the time of a rainstorm and strong winds, bringing down a tree and crushing victims.Eighteen students, according to Ghana National Fire Service spokesman Prince Billy Anaglate, were killed at the falls, while another two were rushed to hospital and died in care. Varying reports indicated possibly up to 18 people remaining in a critical condition who were trapped under the tree, who were then rescued and rushed to hospital, including a Wenchi Senior High School administrator.Anaglate said the wind uprooted trees, which fell on swimmers.  Students' bodies have been sent to the Kintampo Municipal Hospital's morgue.At least 20 people have died and 20 more are injured after a partially constructed flyover (overpass) in Hyderabad, India collapsed onto traffic.The disaster occurred at the Panjagutta junction, near Nagarjuna Circle. Two large concrete sections dropped onto oncoming cars and motorised rickshaws, damaging several severely.A large emergency effort was immediately activated, but experienced severe difficulties in reaching the site due to congested traffic resulting from the collapse. Ambulances from the 108 EMRI Service and Appollo Hospitals attended the scene, and rushed the injured to a variety of nearby hospitals. All the region's major hospitals, particularly the nearby Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences, have placed their medical staff on emergency alert. Rescuers are now using cranes and cutting equipment in an effort to reach anyone who may still be trapped. It is expected that the death toll could rise further as many vehicles remain trapped under tons of debris.Various politicians also attended the scene, including the local district collector, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Dr. YS Rajasekhara Reddy, Senior Congress Leader and MLA from Khairathabad P Janardhan Reddy and several other ministers.Police have asked both the public and the press to keep away from the area, in order to prevent further collapse of the unstable structure. Preliminary investigations suggest the flyover had been been poorly constructed. The construction project had been carried out by leading contractor Gammon India Limited. It had been delayed, the original foundations having been built in 2005. After a successful request by the company to have the deadline for the project extended, work was slated to cease in November of this year, with the flyover entering operation by December. It is believed heavy rains in the area a few hours prior to the collapse may have contributed to the disaster.An early morning coal mine explosion in Beijing, China left 20 miners dead and seventeen trapped inside. The blast occurred at approximately 06:00 am (22:00 UTC) local time in the Henan province, about 430 miles (690 kilometers) south of the capital Beijing.A spokesperson for the State Administration of Work Safety said that the cause of the blast and the depth of the trapped miners are unknown. He also confirmed that seventeen people were trapped instead of 30 as previously reported.China's mining industry is one of the most dangerous in the world with thousands of deaths each year. Earlier this year 115 miners were rescued from a flooded coal mine in China. The group survived by eating sawdust, tree bark, paper and coal. 1,600 illegal Chinese coal mines have already been shut down this year in an attempt by regulators to improve safety standards. The number of fatalities in Chinese mines had fallen, but rose suddenly again earlier this year.20 people are confirmed to have died, 28 have been rescued injured and more than forty are known to be missing after an overcrowded bus plunged into the Rapti River in a mountainous region of West Nepal. The 45-seater vehicle was carrying at least ninety when it skidded off a highway in Dang district, and many were trapped as the bus sank.Police and rescue crews pulled some people out alive but do not believe there wil be any more survivors. "The bus fell 100 metres off the road into the Rapti river. Thirty-two people have been rescued and are getting treatment at a nearby hospital," said local police officer Purna Gurung, although this disagrees with the Thaindian News, which states 28 were injured, and that just under half of these are hospitalised in a serious condition."We fear there may be bodies inside the bus and some may have been swept down the river... We are currently trying to lift the bus out of the river with a crane," he told reporters, adding that no cause has yet been established but it is known that no other vehicles were involved. Search and rescue and recovery operations were hampered by the remote location of the disaster.The bus was headed to a remote Hindu temple on a hilltop. At least 36 people are confirmed to be Indian nationals on a pilgrimage to the holy site.At least 20 people were injured when a covered stand collapsed during a main parade in the Carnival of Blacks and Whites in the Colombian city of Pasto.According to the police, the stands were designed to support 500 people, but there were 700 on them. The intense rains might have also contributed to the collapse as the tents had become too heavy.The Red Cross immediately helped all those affected. Most people presented minor injures although 3 people had to be referred to medical assistance centers.Despite the incident the parade continued along the main streets of the city.On this day twenty years ago, a transatlantic airliner broke up in midair and came down onto the Scottish town of Lockerbie. All 259 people on board Pan Am Flight 103, and eleven people on the ground, lost their lives in what remains the worst air disaster in British history.The disaster was an act of terrorism, caused by a bomb loaded on board. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, an intelligence officer from Libya, was convicted of 270 counts of murder for the bombing in 2001. Libya has since paid US$1.5 billion in compensation to the victims.Today, Megrahi's legal campaign for freedom continues. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission granted him a second appeal, saying there may have been a miscarriage of justice. The terminally ill man will begin that appeal next year. Wikinews wrote to Mr Megrahi in prison but he did not respond.One who does not believe in Megrahi's innocence is Kara Weipz. Her brother Richard Monetti lost his life in the bombing. Weipz, who now heads the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 group, says she represents the large majority of victims' families from the United States when she says that they "believe that there were others who acted with Mr. Megrahi and should be held accountable also," when asked if she felt there was much still to learn about the events twenty years ago.They have, she says, no sense at all that Megrahi may have been wrongly convicted; to the contrary she now has some closure from the trial. "The conviction has brought a sense of justice to the families. No we do not agree with the convict at all. We support the Crown office and the decisions of the Court," she told Wikinews.We asked her if there were any differences between her version of events, and about her thoughts on potential issues with the investigation. "There is no difference between the truth as we see it and the official version of events. The facts are the facts, Mr. Megrahi is guilty," Weipz told Wikinews. "I don't believe there were any issues with the investigation. What bothers me is people with conspiracy theories that spew them as truths. The programs that have been run on TV recently call them conspiracy theories as well." Did the authorities let her down? "Not one bit. I am thankful for the Scottish Police and the FBI."She also revealed that she was not concerned that people might have viewed compensation for the bombing, granted from Libya, as 'blood money'. "Calling it blood money is a misnomer. We entered into a civil trial. The outcome of a civil trial is a monetary one. We knew that since Libya was guilty that the outcome would be that they compensate the families. The only part that bothered me was [that] it was connected to the lifting of sanctions and removal from the State Sponsors Terrorism List. Our goal was to deter terrorism by making it expensive to kill innocent people."One of the aims stated by the website of her victims' group is to maintain the memory of her loved ones; this she felt was still being done - "Absolutely!!!!" was what she told us. She says that the last twenty years have been hard, however: "While I miss my brother [every day], I live a healthy and productive life in his honor. Hard - yes, productive - yes."Megrahi has not been in touch with Weipz, or with any of the other victims, she tells us. Refusing to be drawn into speculation, she tells us she has "no idea" what secret documents Megrahi's defense has been refused permission to see might contain - she has "never seen them" herself, so she does not know what they are.She also did not feel that Megrahi should have been released upon his recent request on compassionate grounds owing to his terminal cancer, as "he is receiving the same medical treatment in prison as he would outside of prison. The Court didn't feel it was appropriate either." Wikinews also asked her if she believes the legal process generally has been fair to him over the years - "Yes, I believe it has been fair."VictimsofPanAmFlight103.org states "we are committed to seeking the truth about this tragedy and keeping the memory of our loved ones alive." The final question Wikinews put to Kara Weipz was this: "Do you think we will ever know the truth?""I would love to say yes, but I don't think we will ever know the whole truth," she told us.Twenty years ago, on July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 crash landed in Sioux City, Iowa, U.S.. 111 of those on board were killed - but the actions of the crew helped save the other 185 flying on the DC-10.The airliner was a trijet, with one engine mounted in the tail. This engine had a cracked fan disc which went undetected by the airline despite inspections, and on that flight the component failed completely, shattering and sending debris flying. This debris damaged all three hydraulic systems that controlled the aircraft, leaving the jet without any conventional means of control. "We had no ailerons. We had no rudder. We had no elevator. We had no spoilers. We had no wing flaps. Everything that controlled the movement of the airplane we lost," said Captain Alfred C. Haynes.The pilots were quickly joined by a DC-10 instructor who was traveling as a passenger, and together they improvised a method of 'skid steering' the aircraft. Captain Haynes recalls "[We had] these two engines, and by varying the thrust on those two engines, we could skid the airplane one way or the other. And if you thrust both throttles up at the same time, the increase in thrust would pitch the nose up, and if you closed both throttles it would pitch the nose down." The flight crew flew the aircraft in this manner for 45 minutes before reaching Sioux Gateway Airport in Iowa's Soiux City. "It looked real good. I thought he was going to make it," said air traffic controller Kevin Bachman of the moments before touchdown. But it wasn't to be: the right wing dropped down and struck the runway, sending the aircraft cartwheeling down the tarmac until it broke up in a fireball.Haynes was knocked out in the accident, and when he came to he "asked if everybody made it. And [flight engineer] Dudley said no. And I said Oh my God, I killed people." The accident occurred as two nearby hospitals were changing shifts,meaning plenty of emergency personnel were on hand to help with the rescue effort. The National Guard were also in the area.Haynes has since come to terms with the accident. He does continue to provide lectures on pulling as a team in challenging circumstances. Today his stance upon the praise directed towards him and his crew is that "If you're going to call a hero, you've got to call everyone involved. The hundreds or thousands involved in the whole operation."A ceremony was held in Sioux City to mark the anniversary. Former 185th Air National Guard chaplain and doctor Dr. Gregory Clapper, who counseled victims and rescuers alike, commented that "Humans are historical beings. When we suffer a loss, the date of the loss becomes so significant. Although it may not be objectively important to others, taking note of that date may be beneficial for those who suffered the loss," he said at the event in Chris Larsen Park.The National Transportation Safety Board's investigation resulted in new procedures for the way airlines inspect their aircraft in the U.S. However modest Haynes and his fellow crew members may be, the fact remains that twenty years on their achievements remain recognized as one of the world's most remarkable displays of airmanship in the face of the odds.Recipients of 2007's Darwin Awards were announced last week, representing the stories of people who are killed or otherwise rendered sterile after committing an "astounding misapplication of judgement."One of this year's top winners was "What Goes Up Must Come Down" which received an 8.0 rating and 8929 votes. The tale concerns a couple in South Carolina who died in hospital after being discovered naked and critically injured on a roadway. Authorities discovered the couple's clothing on a rooftop and concluded that they fell from that location when they engaged "in the act of procreation".Tied for a top score of 8.0 with 4212 votes was "The Enema Within", an account of a Texas man who absorbed alcohol by means of enema because his throat condition made swallowing painful. After consuming 3 litres of sherry in this manner, he died overnight from alcohol poisoning after attaining a deadly blood alcohol level of 0.47%.A runner-up story, "Support Group", featured three incidents where scrap metal thieves ended their lives after removing metal supports under heavy objects.According to the Darwin Awards website, the winners were announced a week later than normal "because Wendy became obsessed with finger loop braiding".Statistics supplied by a survey from the Geneva-based Aircraft Crashes Record Office (ACRO) and by aviation insurance specialist Aon suggest that 2007 was an unusually good year for safety in the aviation industry. The ACRO reports that fatal aircraft accidents involving planes carrying over six people were at their lowest since 1963, while Aon reports that fatal accidents on commercial airliners totaled 23, which Flight International reports to be an all-time low.ACRO reports that 136 crashes killed a total of 965 people worldwide. It says this is 28 fewer crashes than 2006, and also a 25% decrease in fatalities. Flight reported that 23 fatal commercial airliner crashes killed a total of 597 people. That accident rate is the lowest it has ever been, and both figures are well below the average for the last decade, which came in at 35.5 and 846.3 respectively. In 2006, 27 fatal commercial aviation accidents killed 863 people.Aon reports that in 2007 there were 47 commercial hull loss accidents, including all 23 fatal accidents. That includes three accidents involving mishaps occurring to parked aircraft (including China Airlines Flight 120, a Boeing 737-800 that caught fire at the gate with passengers still on board). One hull loss is not included in the statistics; an Airbus A340-600 was destroyed after it rammed a wall during ground testing in Toulouse, but was not counted because the new aircraft was still with Airbus and was yet to be delivered to its first owner, Etihad Airways."In 2007, more than two billion were traveling worldwide and we have thousands and thousands of aircraft, airplanes flying every day worldwide, it means that airplanes, aviation is one of the safest transport modes in the world," said Ronan Hubert, aviation accident historian and head of ACRO.According to Hubet, the highest number of accidents recorded in an individual country was 34 in the United States, followed by Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia and Indonesia. However, he defended US air safety, pointing out that North America accounts for most of the world's air traffic and therefore it was to be expected that there would be a high level of accidents there. He went on to criticise African air safety, which is so poor that most African airlines are on the list of air carriers banned in the EU. He blamed this on political factors. "We know today that countries like Somalia, Sudan and DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo], they are totally unsafe," said Hubert. "But, we know why. Somalia is today a country of which you have a civil war for many years. Sudan, you have big problem of corruption. You have the Darfur problem. You have the civil war also and on the DRC there is plenty of corruption problems also."Hubert makes a distinction between fly-by-night operators in several African countries and reputable national carriers in most African countries. He says national carriers in Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, the North African countries and others are reliable and safe. He says international flights to and from Africa are not the problem, as most of the plane crashes and deaths take place during internal flights in Africa by small, dangerous carriers.The worst aviation disaster all year was the crash of TAM Linhas Aéreas Flight 3054, an Airbus A320 that overan the runway at Congonhas-São Paulo International Airport in Brazil killing 187 on board and 12 on the ground. The disaster was one of just two fatal commercial passenger aircraft accidents that did not either occur in the third world or involve an aircraft registered there. The other was the crash of UTair Flight 471, a Tupolev Tu-134 which crashed while attempting to land at Samara Kurumoch Airport, Russia, killing six of the 57 passengers on board.Congo saw more fatal commercial air crashes than any other country. Four cargo aircraft and two Let 410 passenger flights suffered fatal crashes. One of these accidents involved an Africa One plane which came down in the capital of Kinshasa, killing many on the ground. Indonesia also had a particularly poor year, with two major disasters. Adam Air Flight 574 crashed near Sulawesi; all 102 on board are missing, presumed dead. Later, Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 shot off the runway at Yogykarta International Airport, killing 22. Indonesia also saw another Adam Air plane in a major nonfatal accident, as Flight 172 snapped in two after a hard landing.CCTV footage has been released showing a truck bomb exploding outside the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, Pakistan. The footage shows a camera, which was manually controlled to focus specifically on the developments as they happened.The nearly four minutes of footage, shows a large truck pulling up in front of the hotel at a guarded gate. After the truck attempted to ram through the barrier, some reports stated that guards began to fire shots into the truck."The truck was stopped at the barrier and there was an altercation between the attacker and the guards," said Pakistani Interior Ministry official Rehman Malik in a statement to the press.Guards began to run away once the truck slammed into the gates, but began to approach the truck seconds later. The cabin of the truck then explodes sending sparks and debris in all directions, with some of it hitting the camera. The truck begins to catch fire and people can be seen returning to the scene in an attempt to put out the blaze. Unsuccessful, the truck explodes, taking the camera out with it.Officials believe al-Qaeda is responsible for the attack which killed 53 people and injured almost 300. Rescuers are searching for survivors, as an unknown number of people are still missing. At least 21 of those killed were from foreign countries.Officials say the target was aimed for a residence a block away which was said to be housing Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistan's new prime minister. He was attending a dinner with several other Pakistani officials.Three blasts occurred in Mumbai Wednesday evening in one of the busiest areas of the city. It has been estimated that 21 people have been killed and up to 113 injured. According to a regional government official, Prithviraj Chavan, the explosions were "a co-ordinated attack by terrorists."The first blast took place in South Mumbai's Zaveri Bazar at 1854 local time (1324 UTC), in which several were injured. Here, a motorcycle had a bomb attached to it that exploded next to a jewelry shop. According to eyewitnesses, fire broke out immediately after the blast. The second explosion happened  at the Opera House in Charni Road within a few minutes of the first one. This was the most powerful explosion, caused by a bomb that blew up inside a building. The third one took place in Dadar at 1905 local time (1405 UTC), where a taxi was rigged for the purpose. All three of the locations are commercial and residential areas with busy streets and heavy traffic.According to an eyewitness to the Zaveri Bazar explosion, "[b]odies and limbs were strewn everywhere. People were crying and screaming. The area was packed with shoppers at the time of the blast. A few offered assistance to the blood-soaked victims, while others looked on in a state of shock."The home ministry put the National Security Guard on alert following the blasts in Mumbai.22 passengers were killed when a bus rolled down into a deep gorge near Mahua Dabra Haripura of the Kangra district in northern India this morning. 42 more people were injured.The bus driver lost control of the bus and fell into a hundred-foot-deep gorge 45 km away from Dharmsala, Himachal Pradesh. The bus, which was reported to have been overcrowded, was headed from Dehra to Nagota Suriyan.The wounded passengers have been admitted to the Dr. Rajendra Prasad government medical college in Tanda by a rescue team. Senior civil police and officers are overseeing rescue efforts.Heavy rains and flooding hit Miyi County in Panzhihua, in the southwestern part of Sichuan Province, in China on Sunday killing 22 people. Thirty-eight others were injured and at least 7 others are still missing.The strong storm dropped 177 mm of rain between 21:50 on July 26 and 8:00 a.m. on the next day. Over 100,000 people were affected. About 17,500 residents had to be evacuated from Jiangxi province where rain fell for four days.At present, emergency rescue and disaster relief work is being carried out. Rescue workers are providing blankets while financial aid is being devoted to the area. In total preliminary estimates set damages at ¥225 million yuan (US$33 million) as houses, roads, bridges, and farmland were destroyed.Last spring the province was hit by a 7.9 earthquake which left 68,636 dead and nearly 375,000 injured.23 people have been killed and 36 injured by a stampede at a football stadium in Sudan's capital, Khartoum.The victims had been attending a graduation ceremony for young people who had completed training before beginning one year's military service. The victims had been attempting to enter the stadium when the disaster occurred. According to a police statement, "the majority of them [the victims] are women and children."Khartoum's stadium is actually in the capital's twin city Omdurman. Omdurman Hospital is now treating the injured survivors. Bodies of the deceased have already been taken to the local morgue.French authorities have today revealed that Air France Flight 447 sent 24 error messages shortly before the plane disappeared during the flight between Rio de Janeiro and Paris with 228 people on board. They also said that the plane's auto-pilot was not active, although they say that from the error messages it is impossible to determine the reason for it being inactive. The crash is said to be the world's worst aviation disaster since 2001.Officials have still not determined the reason for the flight's disappearance or located the wreckage of the plane, but have said that it was flying through an area of "powerful cumulo-nimbus" clouds. The authorities continued saying, "these are found frequently in this area and in normal climactic [sic] conditions". However other meteorologists said the jet was entering a zone with unusual storms and 100mph updrafts which could have formed a vacuum, sucking water up from the ocean.Fourteen of the error messages sent by the system were done so within a period of one minute, 2:10 a.m. – 2:11 a.m. UTC. It is thought that some of the error messages are related to the flight speed and controls related to auto thrust. Paul-Louis Arslanian, director of the French air accident investigation agency, said that the error messages indicated systems had shut down one after another. He also confirmed that the plane in question had encountered difficulties with measuring its speed and that Airbus was currently completing "a programme of replacement, of improvement".Airbus and Arslanian insist that planes are still safe, however Airbus have since re-sent information regarding difficulties with calculating speed and confirming their advice in such situations.Previous announcements by the Brazilian air force that they had successfully located part of the wreckage of flight 447 have turned out to be false after ships recovered unrelated debris from the sea. After recovering debris from the sea, including a cargo pallet and two buoys, Brigadier Ramon Cardoso, the director of Brazilian air traffic control said, "[U]p to now, no material from the plane has been recovered."He continued, "We confirm that the pallet found is not part of the debris of the plane. It's a pallet that was in the area, but considered more to be trash. The pallet was made of wood, and the Air France Airbus A330 did not have any wooden pallets on board. That's how we can confirm that the pallet isn't part of the remains of the aircraft". It is thought the pallet came from a passing ship which is also being blamed as to the reason for the oil slick spotted in the area.David Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flight International magazine, said: "The fact that the autopilot was not working is not the cause of this accident", continuing by saying it is "not at all unusual" for the autopilot to cut out, alerting the pilots with a loud warning, adding "it's not the cause, it's the symptom" of the accident.He also said that it was "designed to cut out at any time that it receives conflicting messages, which we know it was" and that "It's designed to cut out rather than controlling the airplane in an unsafe way - it's not an intelligent system, it doesn't know which of the data are correct."Rescuers have long since given up on attempting to find any survivors instead now trying to locate and recover the wreckage of the flight and more importantly the flight data recorders, without which they say they may never know what happened to the flight. The process of recovery is expected to be difficult with the seabed reaching depths of 3,000 to 4,000 meters. Both American and French specialist equipment has been sent to the area with the aim of recovering the recorders, however French officials say that the locator beacons attached to the boxes could possibly have become detached by the force of the impact.Speculation has been rife as to the thought cause of the flights disappearance, ranging from a direct lightning strike to weather in the area, however recently a Spanish pilot has said, via his airline Air Comet, that on a flight in the area he saw an "intense flash of white light". The report, initially released by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo and then confirmed by AFP also said a co-pilot and passenger also saw the bright light."Suddenly, we saw in the distance a strong and intense flash of white light, which followed a descending and vertical trajectory and which broke up in six seconds" the unidentified captain said.24 people had to be rescued by fire fighters after a mechanical fault caused a roller coaster to stop mid journey at the California's Great America theme park in Santa Clara, California, United States. The Invertigo roller coaster malfunctioned at around 12:15 p.m. (PDT) leaving some riders stranded as high as 80 ft from the ground. The ride was stuck for several hours, and the last passenger reached the ground at 5:45 p.m.. None of the riders were injured during the incident. The theme park released a statement saying that the cause of the fault was a faulty lift chain.  They added that getting the ride fixed was "priority number two while the passengers safety was the number one priority." One of the stuck passengers was Shannon Brown who said "there was a lot of noise, parts went flying. A big, heavy piece of metal went flying. It gave a pretty rough stop -- knocked my glasses off."Passengers were given water as they waited in 90(F)-degree heat. Fire captain Scott Kouns said, "It was a hot day in the Santa Clara with temperatures in the 90s. Any length of time trapped on a roller coaster would be uncomfortable, to say the least, and it took at least an hour to get the first person off the ride."After the riders were rescued, the theme park offered complimentary soft drinks and pizza.According to local media, 25 people have died in an illegal coal mine in central China, after a fire broke out there.The incident occurred at the mines of the Dongxing Coal Mining Company, near the city of Zhengzhou, the capital of the Henan province. It is believed that the fire was started by an electrical fault, the Xinhua news agency reports. There were 31 total miners inside the mine; six were able to escape, but the others burnt to death.The owner, manager, and an investor of the mine were taken into police custody on Monday. Their assets, and those of the mine, have been frozen by the authorities. It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze, although an investigation is underway.China's mines are the deadliest in the world; according to Al Jazeera, several thousand miners die each year due to accidents in them. Earlier this month, over 30 people were killed in another coal mine in the northern part of the country, after a flood. The government has pledged to crack down upon illegal mines and enforce safety rules.Twenty-five miners are confirmed dead, two injured, and four missing, after an explosion in a West Virginia coal mine Monday.  The incident occurred in the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, West Virginia.  It is the deadliest mining accident in the United States since 1984.Search and rescue operations were suspended Tuesday due to high levels of methane gas which made conditions unsafe for rescuers.  A team attempting to ventilate the mine is expected to complete the work by Wednesday evening.  Officials said that it was unlikely that the missing miners were still alive, although they would not stop efforts until they were found.The mine is owned by Massey Energy but operated by Performance Coal Company, a subsidiary of Massey, which is the fourth largest coal producer in the US. Federal officials have fined Massey nearly US $900,000 after numerous safety violations were found at the mine that suffered the explosion. To date, Massey has paid around $170,000.US President Barack Obama held a prayer breakfast in the White House Tuesday morning. He said that "I would ask for the faithful who are gathered here to pray for the safe return of the missing, the men and women who put their lives on the line to save them and the souls that have been lost in this tragic accident. May they rest in peace, and may their families find comfort in the hard days ahead."A van carrying around thirty-three people crashed into the Alamatti reservoir on the Krishna river in north Karnataka, killing 25 people while the rest managed to swim to safety. The passengers, including women and children, were from Bagsibundu village in Koppal district and were going to visit the Alamatti dam after going on a pilgrimage to Koodalasangama. District officials rushed to the spot and initiated efforts to rescue survivors and extricate the bodies of the deceased. Chief Minister of Karnataka, H.D Kumaraswamy expressed shock over the accident.25 people were killed today and 33 were injured when a large explosion ripped through a karaoke bar in Tianshifu, Liaoning Province, China. The state-run Xinhua news agency says the cause of the disaster is under investigation. Four people are reported to be in a serious condition.Originally, Xinhua reported only five fatalities, but as rescue workers continued to move away debris, the full extent of the death toll was discovered. Xinhua has also reported that several employees at the bar, as well as the wife of the owner, were being questioned. According to a philly.com article authored by The Associated Press, Xinhua failed to state whether this was as witnesses or as suspects in any potential criminal activity, but the Shanghai Daily said that Xinhua had reported the people had been detained as suspects. The owner himself, Mr. Qu, was killed in the blast.Investigators say they are currently unsure if the blast was purely accidental, or if foul play was involved, as all efforts were initially focused on attempting to locate survivors. The two-storey building, which also housed a bathhouse, was completely leveled by the blast. In addition, several cars were buried under the debris and windows in nearby buildings were shattered by the pressure wave. A power cut in the area was also caused by the blast due to damage to the local electricity network.77-year-old local resident Chen Xiaohong, who lives 50 metres from ground zero, described the explosion: "I was watching my grandson finishing his lessons. Suddenly, we heard a big bang, then the door burst open from effects of a powerful shock wave and the lights went out... We were lucky not to have been hurt." Meng Xianling, who runs a seafood stall located down a narrow lane opposite the site of the accident building, commented that "I was afraid the parlor's boiler would explode. Mercifully, it didn't."China has been the location of many disasters in both public and private places, such as fires and explosions. Earlier this year, an unsafe arrangement with a two-ton steel ladle resulted in the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation disaster, in which molten steel was accidentally poured into a room full of workers, killing 32. The majority of China's accidents stem from a combination of lax safety regulations and negligence, and accidents continue regularly despite promises by the government to prevent them.25 people were killed and eight more injured after a bus left the road and plunged into a river gorge in a mountainous region of Kashmir, Pakistan.The bus was carrying around 40 people when it left the road in the Neelum Valley. According to a local military official who declined to give his name to reporters "It was apparently due to overspeeding. That's the reason witnesses are giving".The crash occurred 45 km (30 miles) Northeast of the town of Muzaffarabad, according to the same official. The bus had been heading for the town, having originated from Jura.The military continues to search for six more passengers who are known to be missing.At least 26 workers were killed and five were injured in China after an accident at a tin mine in the Hunan province, national media reported.The official Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted a rescue team as saying that nineteen of the miners were killed instantly after two lifts fell due to a brake failure on Thursday. Another seven died later due to their injuries.An investigation into the accident has been launched, Xinhua reported.China has some of the most deadly mines in the world. Official statistics indicate that over 3,200 miners died in mine accidents in last year alone, although independent groups suggest the actual number might be higher, as not all incidents are reported.26 motorcycles and two cars have piled up on the Interstate 5 road in Oregon, United States. Two bikers have been critically injured.The crash occurred near the Baldock Rest Area, which is just south of Wilsonville, at 2:45 p.m. Friday. The group of motorbikes, belonging to members of the Brother Speed club, was in the left (fast) lane behind one of the cars when traffic slowed down. Despite attempts to take evasive action, the bikes and car collided. The second car was hit by a motorbike that veered into the middle lane.The bikes were in a formation of two columns — standard for large motorbike parties.  According to eyewitness Terry Scott, a silver SUV suddenly slammed on its brakes and while the leading two bikers managed to swerve out of the way, the rest were caught up in a chain reaction.  "There were bikes and people and gear flying," said Scott, who had been driving with his girlfriend behind the bikes.The crash scene was "ordered mayhem" according to Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue's captain Mike Towner. "Firefighters from Aurora and Canby were providing medical care to injured bikers as non-injured bikers tried to assist," he said.A LifeFlight air ambulance took two bikers to hospital and eight more were taken away by ambulances. Some bikers suffered from broken bones as well as shoulder and hip injuries. KPTV quotes the club's website as saying that they are "serious about brotherhood, respect, riding fast and building Choppers."The accident was responded to by paramedics and firefighters from various locations, including Canby, St. Paul, Woodburn and those from the multi-city Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue. The entire road was closed northbound until 4 p.m., when one lane was reopened. Investigators kept the other lanes closed until 6 p.m.Officials say 27 people are dead after a plane crashed into the sea off east Indonesia today. Fifteen bodies have been recovered and it is thought the others on board have sunk with the wreckage."I can confirm that all the passengers were killed when the plane exploded as it crashed into the sea," an Indonesian navy official told local radio station ElShinta. He said around ten navy divers were sent to the Papua crash site 400 metres off-shore in six kilometres of water but "had difficulties locating them [trapped passengers] due to strong currents and limited equipment."Merpati Nusantara Airlines has not confirmed passenger numbers. A transport ministry spokesman said the ministry is "still checking on the passengers' situation," adding "the weather was pretty bad at the time [of the crash]." Built by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the propellor-driven MA60 was 500 metres from a runway when it crashed, according to airport officials.The nation of islands has heavy use of aviation and a poor safety record, including the crash of an Adam Air jet in 2007 that killed 102 people near Sulawesi. The European Commission had banned all Indonesian airlines from entering it, but two years ago flag carrier Garuda Indonesia was deemed to have improved and allowed to enter.Twenty-seven people have been killed after a bus was engulfed by fire in Chongqing, Southwest China today; 11 more were hospitalized.None of the 38 on board escaped unscathed after the disaster occurred at around 5 p.m. local time. Emergency services rushed the injured to a nearby hospital for treatment, while two vice-mayors visited the scene of the tragedy.It is not currently known what caused the accident.Floods in the Algerian town of Ghardaïa which is in the M'zab Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, have killed at least 29 people according to local officials and Ali Belkhir, the head of public health for the north African country.Belkhir confirmed that "following these floods, we can sadly declare that 29 people have died." He also said that 84 people were injured, although the Algerian interior ministry has since lowered the toll to 48. Six hundred homes were also flooded in the incident, and several hundred people were evacuated by helicopter.According to reports on Algerian national radio, there may also be undiscovered damage in towns nearby Ghardaïa, which is approximately 600 kilometres from the Algerian capital, Algiers.The flooding was caused by storms that flooded a seasonal river, known locally as a wadi, which can rise quickly by around 8 metres.Ghardaïa is the capital of the Ghardaïa Province, located on the edge of the Sahara desert, and it has a population of approximately 100,000. The city was founded in the 11th century and has a pyramid-style mosque at its center.Gary Knowles, head of the search and rescue operation at the New Zealand Pike River Mine,  told media a second explosion has occurred inside the mine. He stated there is no possibility any of the 29 men still inside could have survived.The situation began on Friday, around 3:45pm local time, with an explosion at the mine which is about halfway between the West Coast towns of Greymouth and Reefton. Emergency services began responding at 4.53pm; two miners managed to walk out and were treated for minor injuries at Grey Base Hospital, with 27 originally believed missing.Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn initially stated: "We are holding on to hope. Look at Chile, all those miners were trapped and they all came out alive."Early Saturday, Pike River Coal chief executive Peter Whittall reported 29 were trapped underground, ranging from 17 to 62 years old. They were a mix of New Zealand, South African, Australian, and British nationals. Miners' families congregated at a hall in Greymouth, and were updated by the search and rescue leadership twice daily. Media briefings were also held twice daily.Families and the public began to feel frustration that rescuers had not yet moved into the mine. The search co-ordinator Superintendent Garry Knowles explained that the gas levels in the mine meant that the risk of another explosion was too high to allow entry. The Police Commissioner, Minister of Police, and Prime Minister all confirmed they supported the decision not to send rescuers in while expert analysis showed the mine was still unsafe.The New Zealand Defence Force supplied a bomb-disposal robot to take video footage inside the mine. However, the robot only made it 550 metres up the tunnel before being shorted out by water in the mine. Later, the robot was restarted; this time it made it 1000 metres in before running out of battery. A second Defence robot was also sent in and recorded some video footage. A 160 metre long bore-hole was drilled from the surface into an area deeper in the mine to gauge the gas levels in areas closer to where the miners could be. It was reported that the samples from that bore-hole were showing up to 95 percent methane.At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Superintendent Knowles reported that there had been a second large explosion at 2:37pm, at least as big as the first. "Unfortunately I have to inform the public of New Zealand that at 2.37pm today there was another massive explosion underground and based on that explosion no one survived." He said the rescue team and experts believed survival was impossible. The Grey District Mayor reported that a recovery team had gone in while gas levels were still low. In a more extended briefing, the Pike River Mining chief executive explained this had not occurred as the mine was still too dangerous, but said they would do everything they could to recover the bodies.International leaders including Queen Elizabeth have sent their condolences.A Vietnamese coal transport ship sank in the South China Sea on Friday killing three people on board, reported the Xinhua News Agency.The ship sank 22 kilometers (14 miles) from the Fangcheng Port in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.The Nanhaijiu 196 rescue vessel was dispatched about 8 pm local time, when authorities were notified that the ship may sink. The coal transport ship sank about 9:30pm Friday. There were winds up to 90 kilometers per hour when the ship sank during a gale.Saturday morning rescue operations were supplemented by a rescue helicopter. There were a total of seven crew members on board. Four are missing, while three bodies have been recovered by the South China Sea Rescue Bureau.Local officials in southern Afghanistan say a roadside bomb blasted a passenger bus Tuesday, killing 30 civilians and wounding at least 39 others. The latest violence comes days after a UN report declared August the deadliest month of the year for civilians in Afghanistan.  The Afghan government blamed the Taliban for the latest attack outside the southern city of Kandahar. No one has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, which killed dozens of civilians, including women and children, who were riding on the bus.Afghan presidential spokesman Humayoon Hamedzada said that the authorities are investigating the matter. "We are deeply sorry for the loss of life, but our provincial authorities and the security agencies have received instructions to complete the investigations," he said. Lal Jan, one of the survivors from the explosion, described his experiences. "An explosion hit the bus. I don't know what happened. When I came to, I got out of the bus and saw that the bus was totally wrecked," he said.Tuesday's explosion occurred just west of the city on a highway, where a similar blast killed three civilians a day earlier.Provincial police chief Sardar Mohammad Zazai claimed that "the enemies of Afghanistan are planting mines on the main highway and killing innocent women and children." In a statement, the government said that "the mine was placed by enemies of the country."Late last week, the United Nations issued a report that said it had recorded some 1,500 civilian casualties between January and August. August was this year's deadliest month, as the Taliban sought to discourage people from voting in the presidential election. The report also said almost three times as many civilian deaths were attributed to anti-government elements than to pro-government forces.The spokesman for international forces in Afghanistan, US Army Colonel Wayne Shanks, said that NATO troops are working with local populations to clear the roads of Taliban bombs. "Every time [the Taliban kills] innocent civilians, they are hurting themselves," Shanks said. "Just like if we make a mistake and we hurt innocent civilians, we are hurting ourselves. And we are trying to absolutely fix that." Meanwhile in Pakistan, authorities say another suspected US missile strike targeted militants in South Waziristan. Officials believe the insurgents in Pakistan's tribal regions have ties to the Taliban and al-Qaeda and use the area as a base of operations for strikes in Afghanistan against foreign troops.Three car bombs were detonated in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq on Sunday morning, killing 30 people. The attacks were aimed at foreign embassies, according to sources. 224 people were wounded in the bombings which occurred in quick succession according to officials."They were suicide attacks against the Egyptian and Iranian embassies," commented Major General Qassim Atta, who is the spokesperson for the Baghdad operations of the Iraqi security agencies. According to him, one of the attacks were at a junction close to the German and Syrian embassies. The German foreign ministry officials claimed that an security guard of Iraq was killed while three others were injured. The head of the Egyptian embassy's security was killed and several guards were wounded in the blast.Atta stated that Iraqi security agencies had barred a car with a bomb in Masbah, central Baghdad. The car was allegedly to be used to attack the headquarters of security police, whose work was to protect embassy officials. The bomb was defused and the driver of the car arrested by security forces.The explosions which occurred almost simultaneously broke windows in adjoining buildings, sparked exchange of gunfire between the security personnel and the attacker, thereby sending smoke clouds in the sky. Two suicide car bombs were detonated in the neighbourhood of Mansur in west Baghdad while a third explosion occurred close to the Iranian embassy in the city. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks.Said Mohammed, a witness of the blast near the Egyptian embassy, said guards had made an attempt to stop the bomber. "Three security guards shouted at the truck to stop moving, and opened fire on the driver," said he. He angrily shouted at Iraqi army officers on seeing this, saying: "How did the truck get here?"Pieces of shrapnel covered the street in front of the embassy building. The entrance to the building was destroyed; a crater five metres (16 feet) in diameter could be seen near it."The explosion [at the Iranian embassy] was really strong," said Abu Ahmed, a taxi driver who was an eyewitness of one of the blasts. "They never kill ministers, officials or heads of state. They kill taxi drivers, public employees and shopkeepers. How much longer will this last?"The frequency of attacks in Iraq has fallen from the levels in 2006 or 2007; however figures issued on Thursday showed that last month, 367 Iraqis had been killed in attacks, the highest this year.At least 43 people have died and at least 46 injured, 4 of whom are in critical condition, in a metro train crash in Spanish city of Valencia, according to the regional government. It has been reported that two of the carriages have derailed and overturned, leading to the evacuation of 150 passengers. A part of the wall in the tunnel between the Plaza de España and Jesús stations in the southwestern neighborhood of Patraix may have collapsed, causing the derailment of one of the carriages, which in turn caused the carriage behind it to overturn.Another theory put forth by subdelegate of the regional government Luis Felipe Martínez is that the wheels on one of the carriages fell off while the train was speeding. The same source has also confirmed that there are two overturned carriages.The fire department, paramedics and local police are on the scene after a passenger in the crashed train called the emergency services at about 1:03 p.m. CEST (1103 UTC). The authorities have closed the area to all road traffic and routes 1 and 2 of the Valencia metro system, which use the affected rail tracks, are shut down.The incident comes days before Pope Benedict XVI was due to visit Valencia for the World Meeting of the Families, expected to be attended by one million pilgrims.Two successive suicide bombings killed 30 people in a camp providing aid to displaced people in northwestern Pakistan, police officials stated. The two explosions hit the Kacha Pukha camp located near the city of Kohat. Nearly 50 people were wounded.Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder said from Islamabad that the bomber hit the camp when a food distribution programme was underway. "This was a point where registration was under way and food distribution was under way," he said. "Most of the victims were the displaced people from the Orakzai agency where the military has launched an offensive recently, displacing a large number of people. The attack is said to have involved a suicide bomber and perhaps a remote-controlled device planted near that particular area," he added."At least 27 people have died. There are 45 wounded. The toll may go up," regional police chief Dilawar Khan Bangash told the Agence France-Presse news agency from the scene of the incident. "Both were suicide attacks. Body parts of the suicide bombers have been recovered. The blasts took place at the relief distribution point for internally displaced people." Officials later confirmed that the death toll was 30.It is not immediately clear who was responsible for the bombing.A bus collision with a truck in Uganda has resulted in at least 30 fatalities and has left a further 21 injured. The bus, which was heading for Nairobi in Kenya, crashed in the Kabale district of Uganda near the Rwandan border. Of the 30 fatalities, 25 died instantly upon impact whilst the remaining 5 died later in hospital. "There were 20 survivors, the majority of them are in critical condition," said Cyprian Gatete, Rwanda's assistant commissioner of police, during a telephone conversation with Reuters.The survivors of the accident were initially taken to Kabale Hospital in Uganda, but were later flown back to hospitals in Rwanda. It remains to be seen what exactly caused the accident, however South African news source Independent Online is reporting that a Rwandan reporter on the scene speculated that the bus seemed to have swerved into oncoming traffic.China has rescued more than 300 Vietnamese fishermen who were missing in the wake of a record typhoon, Chanchu, which blasted the South China Sea.Survivors were found on 22 Vietnamese ships near the Pratas Islands, off the southern coast of Guangdong province. State television reported the rescue as the "largest international marine rescue operation ever mounted by China." Eight fishing ships sank 1,000 km east of Vietnam's central city of Danang, while eight remained missing. Rescuers had found 26 bodies and rescued 81 others, the Vietnamese government said in a statement. "However, the number of missing fishermen and the ships remains huge," Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said on state-run Vietnam Television. On the Da Nang coast, relatives of the missing fishermen erected altars with flowers and fruits. Weeping families burnt incense and prayed for loved ones to return.Typhoon Chanchu was downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday when it crossed the southern Chinese coast. The storm caused landslides, flooding and forced around a million people to evacuate. Landslides and collapsing buildings killed 15 people and left four missing in China's Fujian province. Eight more people died in neighboring Guangdong province. Flooding in southern Taiwan swept two women to their deaths. Chanchu, the most powerful on record to enter the South China Sea in May, left a wake of damage in the region - killing at least 37 people in the Philippines last weekend. The typhoon, with winds of up to 170 km per hour, has reportedly killed 23 people in China. Vietnam's Fisheries Ministry had listed more than 400 fishermen as missing from Danang city and the nearby provinces of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.A fire broke out in a refugee camp in eastern Chad Friday, leaving 3,000 people homeless and injuring 10, according to the United Nations (UN) refugee agency United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Refugees have been living in the camp as a result of the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan.The fire started in the Goz Amer camp triggered by a cooking fire that had gone unwatched. The fire moved quickly through the camp due to high winds. Many of the refugees lost all of their belongings and food rations in the blaze. After receiving tents from the UNHCR in 2004, many of the refugees built traditional dwellings out of sticks and mud, and these shelters burned rapidly in the fire.In a UNHCR press release, Emmanuel Uwurukundo, acting UNHCR head in Koukou-Angarana said: "Everybody around, refugees and all our partners alike, rushed to the spot and tried to extinguish the fire with whatever they had: clothes, extinguishers and water. The teamwork was outstanding."In Geneva the UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres commented on the situation: "The refugees have already suffered so much tragedy and now face yet another trauma. I am deeply relieved that there was no loss of life in this devastating fire. We will do everything we can to help and to get shelter and food supplies to them as quickly as possible."Families affected by the fire were housed at three area schools, and the UNHCR announced on Friday that it planned to deliver aid supplies including sleeping mats, blankets and kitchen sets. The World Food Programme was also asked by the UNHCR for an extra monthly food ration to be delivered to the families whose homes were destroyed in the blaze.The Goz Amer camp houses about 20,500 refugees, and is located approximately 70 kilometers from the Sudanese border. Goz Amer is one of 12 UNHCR-run camps along the Chad-Sudan which all told contain over 240,000 refugees from Darfur.Chad and Sudan signed a peace agreement on March 13 in an attempt to end a five-year conflict, and the leaders of both countries agreed not to back rebel groups that are active near their borders.Approximately 2.2 million people from the Darfur region have left their homes since the beginning of the violence in 2003. The UN puts the number of deaths due to the Darfur conflict at over 200,000, and the Sudanese government has said that only 9,000 have died.According to authorities in Mexico, 31 prisoners have died as the result of a fight which broke out in a prison, involving alleged members of drug businesses. Thirteen prisoners were also wounded in the brawl, which occurred in the Altamira municipality on Wednesday.Temporary weapons, such as knives, were reportedly used by inmates to attack each other; a signifcant number of deaths occurred as a result of the use of weapons like these, authorities stated. One anonymous state official spoke of deaths occurring due to clubs and stones being used as weapons. The violence apparently commenced when a number of prisoners entered an area of the prison they were prohibited from entering and attacked the prisoners situated there. Police officers, with the assistance of soldiers, were eventually able to intervene and restore order within the prison, officials reported. Marines are also understood to have intervened.22 of the prisoners killed had been sentenced to prison for state crimes, while the other nine had been jailed for federal offences, according to Mexico's public safety department. The department provided no further information about the incident. According to Voice of America [VoA], a significant number of the inmates at the prison are serving sentences on drug-related charges.Although unconfirmed by the Mexican government, it has been reported by Mexican media that the violence occurred between members of the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas, two Mexican drug cartels which rival each other. It is understood by VoA that violence from the Mexican Drug War spreads into prisons frequently. According to BBC News Online, a substantial number of Mexican jails are over capacity for prisoners and often experience drug cartel-related violence.A suicide bomber blew himself up on a bus carrying more than 50 people in Kabul, Afghanistan killing at least 31 and critically injuring 17 of the people on board. 28 were Afghan soldiers, and so far at least two civilians have been killed."At this time I can tell you that 31, almost all of them military personnel, have been martyred," said Afghanistan's Public Health Minister, Sayed Mohammad Amin Fatemi.Reports say that the suicide bomber, who was dressed in a military uniform, walked onto the bus and blew himself up, tearing it into two pieces.

Durairaj, said to the Agence France-Presse news agency.He said that six more people had been hurt and were hospitalised. Many of the victims were people purchasing firecrackers ahead of the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali.The fire began at a rice mill that had been temporarily converted into a warehouse for firecrackers. "The explosion was triggered by a firecracker which burst in the congested warehouse and people did not have time to escape," Durairaj said.Fires are frequent in India in factories and warehouses storing firecrackers, due in part to relaxed safety standards. No less than seventeen people were killed at another fireworks factory in Tamil Nadu earlier in 2009. In 2007, 32 people were killed by a fire in the state of Bihar.351 people have been reported dead after a cyclone hit Burma, which is also known as Myanmar. As a result it has been declared by the Burmese government that five states are currently disaster areas.A diplomat in the area spoke to the Reuters news agency, giving them a description of the scene. He said that the area around him looked like a 'war zone' as a result of the cyclone.An official from the United Nations also commented on the situation. "It’s a bad situation. Almost all the houses are smashed. People are in a terrible situation,” he said.Another UN representative also spoke on the incident. He reported that "The Irrawaddy delta was hit extremely hard not only because of the wind and rain but because of the storm surge."The Daily Telegraph , a UK newspaper, reported that the food price in Burma could be affected by this incident.38 people were killed on Saturday when a US Chinook helicopter crashed west of Kabul, Afghanistan, with the Taliban claiming responsibility for the crash.Thirty Americans were killed in the crash, including at least seventeen members of SEAL Team 6, Air Force members, the helicopter's crew, a dog handler and a civilian interpreter, while eight members of the Afghan Army were also on board and died.According to witnesses, members of the Taliban and officials from the US and Afghanistan, the Chinook was deliberately targeted, apparently  by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG).  While no American officials have spoken on the record about the cause of the crash, anonymous sources have said that the helicopter was shot down, an assertion that corresponds with reports from local officials and witness, who said that the helicopter crashed after a rocket struck it.The Taliban said that they had brought the aircraft down while it was involved in an operation targeting a house where insurgents were meeting.  While Taliban forces do not have a history of shooting down aircraft, they claim to have modified their RPGs for improved accuracy, but there is no proof of this.The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, warned against leaping to conclusions, however, saying that "[i]nformation is still coming in about this incident. I think it's important that we allow investigators to do their work before jumping to too many conclusions."President Barack Obama issued a statement after the incident, saying that "[t]heir deaths are a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families, including all who have served in Afghanistan."At least 38 miners are dead after methane exploded in an underground coal mine in Russia. 180 people made it out of the mine, and at least 7 of those were seriously injured. At least 217 miners were inside when the explosion occurred."Up to 45 people could have been at the epicenter of the blast. One hundred and eighty people have been brought out. Of these, five have life-threatening injuries. The fate of the other [trapped] miners is unknown. According to the (mining) company’s information, there were 194 workers and 23 engineering inspectors underground [when the mine exploded]," said a spokesman for Russia's Emergency Ministry.The explosion occurred at the Yubileynaya (Jubilee) Mine located in Novokuznetsk, Russia in the Kemerovo Oblast at approximately 7:40 a.m. local time on Thursday [11:40 p.m. eastern time on Wednesday]. Yuzhkuzbassugol currently owns the mining facility.The mine has already received several violations, and according to Russia's industrial safety agency the mine would likely lose its license to operate. "Such a decision could be taken after an inquiry into all the circumstances of the accident at the Yubileinaya mine. Particularly since we have already found violations at Yuzhkuzbassugol mines."38 people were said to have died in a suicide bombing during a political rally in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. The attack occurred in the town of Timergarah in north east Pakistan.The incident occurred during a political rally by the leading local party. The attacker detonated a bomb, thereby blowing himself in Timargarah, 80 km (50 miles) northeast of the provincial capital, Peshawar, the principal town in the Lower Dir district. Pakistani security forces led a major operation against the Taliban in this region.According to residents, the bomb exploded near the stage built for the organized celebrations.

"There are more than 100 injured. Most of them are in a serious condition. I'm still sending out my ambulance," he added.Mumtaz Zareen, Timargarah police chief, told AFP news agency that the attack was a suicide bombing; according to him, "the man came on foot and detonated himself."The Awami National Party (ANP), the predominant political party in North West Frontier Province had organized the celebrations because of their decision to rename the province to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. "Our party had arranged a thanksgiving day to celebrate the changing of the name after 200 years of colonial legacy," he said to a private news agency.According to Haji Mohammad Adeel of ANP, the Talibans had "lost the battle" and were executing such "cowardly" attacks "out of desperation." This attack was followed by a triple attack in Peshawar by suspected Islamist insurgents.A school bus overturned Tuesday morning in Charlotte, North Carolina causing minor injuries to two children and two adults.  The driver reportedly swerved to avoid a log in the road. The bus rolled down an embankment and came to rest on its roof.  The children on the bus were 3 and 4 year-olds from the Bethlehem Center Head Start program.  The bus was carrying 18 children, all strapped into safety seats in accordance with North Carolina law. The uninjured were transferred to a second bus and taken to school.A four-year-old boy has been killed by a dog in the city of Liverpool in Merseyside, England. The child has been identified as John Paul Massey. The animal belonged to his uncle. The boy's 63-year-old grandmother Helen Foulkes tried to protect the boy but ended up getting bitten by the dog in the process. She had to receive hospital treatment for the injury.The dog itself was shot dead in the front garden of the house where the attack had taken place. The police had said that they did not take further action after receiving a report about dog breeding earlier this year.Chief Superintendent Steve Ashley from the police force said about the incident: "In February this year a housing officer rang Merseyside Police to say they had received complaints of dog breeding at the address. At that time the police said it wasn't a police matter and no action was taken by Merseyside Police.That is contrary to our policies and an investigation is now launched into exactly what happened in February."A light earthquake, measured at a magnitude of 4.3, struck the San Francisco, California region at 10:40 AM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on Monday morning. The earthquake was described as "short, but strong" by a dispatcher for the Morgan Hill Police Department. The quake was originally reported as having a magnitude of 4.4.According to the US Geological survey, the epicentre of the quake was approximately eleven miles north of Morgan Hill, or about 16 miles southeast of San Jose.No immediate damage has been reported, but Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains were delayed for five to ten minutes while inspectors searched for any damage.The earthquake was felt as far away as Santa Rosa and Napa to the north and Soledad to the south.Over 400 survivors have been pulled from the water, along with 195 bodies, leaving approximately 800 still missing. Tensions are rising between the ferry owners and the families of the passengers, many of whom have been camping out on the dock since the accident. Many are complaining that they have been given very little information regarding the passengers. While details about the passengers are not available, information regarding condition aboard the ferry have been quickly spreading, including reports that there were not enough lifejackets and lifeboats for everyone, and that alarm systems were malfunctioning.  The crew has also been accused of ignoring problems.Witnesses are reporting that a fire started aboard the ferry approximately 90 minutes into the trip, possibly either on the deck where the vehicles were stored or in the engine room. It appears that the fire spread quickly and filled the ferry with smoke. While the crew appears to have contained the fire properly and the ferry most likely had a fire suppression system, excess water was not removed afterwards. This caused the ferry to become unstable as its center of gravity was no longer fixed. Rough winds were then able to knock the ship over in what is known as a Free Surface Effect.Pakistani police have said that a suicide bombing near the Swat Valley killed 41 people on Monday.  Monday's attack is Pakistan's fourth act of terrorism in eight days, killing a total of more than 100 people. It also came as the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Saturday's assault on the country's heavily guarded army headquarters in Rawalpindi.  "Forty-one people were killed and 45 were injured in the suicide blast," provincial information minister Mian Iftekhar said.Police say the attacker targeted a military convoy, setting off a huge blast in a crowded market square in the Shangla district. The suicide bomber was reported to be very young, around thirteen or fourteen years old. He flung himself at a convoy passing nearby and detonated the explosives."When he blew himself up, some of the trucks carrying ammunition were also hit and the ammunition exploded, causes more human losses. He was 13 or 14 years old, according to our investigations so far," said a Swat Media Centre spokesman.Earlier, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a 22-hour siege on the country's army headquarters that ended on Sunday. "As long as Pakistan continues its operation against the Taliban, we will also keep continuing such attacks," said Azam Tariq, a spokesman for the Taliban, to the Agence France-Presse news agency.Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said that security forces were able to intercept a phone conversation of Pakistani Taliban deputy leader, Wali-ur-Rehman. He added that the call was evidence the group Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan had planned the assault from South Waziristan with the intention of taking hostages in order to free captured militants."This organization is responsible for more than 80 percent of all the attacks, suicide attacks and acts of terrorism, in our country," Abbas said. "There will be [an] operation in this area.  But it is now a matter of military judgment (of) what is the appropriate time."Last Monday, a suicide bomber struck a heavily guarded UN aid agency in Islamabad, killing five people. On Friday, a suspected militant exploded a car bomb in the middle of a busy market in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing more than 50 people.The Pakistani military has been proposing an operation in South Waziristan for the past several months. Tens of thousands of civilians have fled the area.The former security chief of Pakistan's tribal regions, Mahmood Shah, told the Voice of America news agency that the recent attacks, including Saturday's assault, show the militants are united and may want to antagonize the international community."The message by [the] attack on the GHQ [Pakistan's army headquarters] is possibly that the army is protecting (the country's] nuclear assets, and therefore, if the GHQ can be attacked, how can [the army] protect the nuclear assets?" Shah asked.However, Pakistani authorities dismissed suggestions that Pakistan's nuclear installations are threatened by the country's growing insurgency.Floods affecting five states in northeastern Brazil have left hundreds of thousands homeless and have taken 44 lives. Heavy rainfall which began in early April has caused overland flooding that has destroyed homes in the region and landslides that have blocked roads, including 6 major highways, and a railway.The Associated Press reports that over 300,000 are homeless in north eastern Brazil, and CNN states 270 communities have been affected by overland water from flooded rivers. This flood has been the worst to strike the area since the 1950s and officials estimate damages at one billion reais (about US$482 million).Civil defence authorities placed the homeless figure at about 185,000 as of Saturday. Emergency shelters have taken in some of the homeless, and friends and relatives have opened their doors to others who have been forced from their homes.Maranhão has been hit the hardest, and has lost nine residents, two due to electrocution.

The state of Amazonas has lost eight people so far. The Rio Negro, the largest tributary of the Amazon, has been rising. Piauí is suffering from two swollen rivers, no electricity due to power failures, and no potable water.The Brazilian government began to send food via military cargo planes on Friday. The government has also sent out rice and beans by boat and helicopter to a few places. Officials verify that they are sending out as much aid as possible.  Land slides combined with overland waters have washed out roads are making deliveries challenging.Emergency flood crews are struggling to open roads and pathways for food, supplies and aid.File:Itajai floods.jpg"We have to go out and find food because almost nothing's arrived here," said a victim helping out in an emergency shelter. Homeless people huddled together by the thousands in tents and cow pens are fishing and leaving by canoe to find food.Besides drowning, electrocution is also taking victims. rattlesnakes and anacondas, and alligators are also displaced and are swimming through partially submerged communities in the swollen waters.This northeastern region of Brazil typically endures drought-like conditions. meteorologists are baffled by the deluge of rain which hit the area for the past fourteen days. Precipitation is estimated to continue for another week and half.A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) passenger plane crashed shortly after take-off in the eastern Pakistani city of Multan. The police chief present at the location told Reuters that all 41 passengers and 4 crew members on board died in the crash. "Everyone is dead. I am standing at the site," Iftikhar Babar, the police chief, told Reuters. Airport officials said PIA Flight PK 688 left Multan heading for Lahore and Islamabad. It crashed 10 minutes after take-off, "Bodies are badly charred. The debris has caught fire," an eyewitness told Reuters. He said rescue workers from the privately run relief foundation Edhi, the Civil Aviation Authority, and the army were taking part in the rescue operation.Pakistan's private Geo Television station also stated the aircraft to be in flames. They describe it as having gone down in a wheat field near a mango orchard, two miles from the airport. Several trees were burning from the impact of the crash and a perimeter wall was damaged. It also appeared to have hit an electric power line while crashing in the field. Police have cordoned off the area and are keeping people away from the scene.It is still unclear if anyone on the ground has been killed or injured.A PIA spokesman said: "The plane lost contact with the control tower about two minutes after take-off. We don't know what happened to it."Mohammed Iqbal, an airline security official, confirmed that there were 41 passengers and four crew members on board the Fokker aircraft.The bodies of 46 Afghan illegal immigrants who suffocated to death in a container truck Saturday near Quetta, Pakistan, returned home Tuesday.The Edhi Foundation placed the victim's bodies into coffins to transport them back to Chaman. Funeral prayers were said before victims left Quetta hospital. "We are taking these dead bodies to Spin Boldak and later these will be flown to Kabul by helicopter. We are thankful to Pakistan government for every help," said Afghan consul general Daud Mohsini.Afghan officials received the bodies from The Edhi ambulances and Pakistan police escorts at the Pak-Afghan border Bab-e-Dosti (Friendship Gate). Security was high and traffic was backed up at the border crossing. The bodies were taken to Kandahar then to Kabul before they were laid to rest in their home towns. Hamid Karzai, President of Afghanistan dispatched aircraft to Pakistan to bring home the 46 victims. Poor weather grounded the planes, and the bodies were driven back across the border.Pakistan police found a locked truck packed with approximately 111 Afghan illegal immigrants around 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Quetta on Saturday. The driver had fled the scene where 62 people were initially pronounced dead. Police said that from the strong smell emanating from the truck, the victims may have died days before they were discovered.45 other people were found unconscious and taken directly to the hospital. At hospital two more migrants died. "The death toll is 46," said Ghulam Dastagir, a police official.Wazir Khan Nasir, a senior police official said, "We have been able to talk to some of the people, who were trapped in the container. They were all Afghans in the container and the container was going to Iran, When the condition of people inside the container deteriorated, the driver fled, leaving the container." Survivors have reported that a human smuggling racket locked 64 Kabul residents and 37 Spin Boldak residents in the truck container Friday afternoon. The truck's air conditioning unit stopped working causing the locked passengers to cry out for help which was unheeded by the truck's driver, and they fell unconscious. However, the loud ruckus caused by the trapped people inside did alert police and local residents to their plight.  The trip had cost each illegal immigrant US$4,000 to 8,000 for the trip.  Gul Zameen, a survivor said, "We are all poor and wanted to find jobs in Quetta and Iran." The survivors have been charged under the Foreigners Act and some have been detained. Karzai has ordered an investigation and "demanded people avoid dangerous illegal migration and not be deceived by smugglers." "We'll go to Pakistan and talk to the survivors to find out what had exactly happened. The culprits will be brought to justice," said Moheeddin Baluch head of the investigating delegation. Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) is also investigating. Five suspects believed to be involved in running the human smuggling racket have been arrested.A Venezuelan plane with 46 passengers onboard has been reported missing in western Venezuela, officials say.The Santa Barbara Airlines plane took off just before dusk from the city of Mérida en route to Simón Bolívar International Airport outside the capital city of Caracas.Noel Marquez, director of Venezuela's emergency management agency in Mérida, said the plane has failed to contact control towers. Civil Defense chief General Antonio Rivero told reporters that it is unknown whether or not the plane crashed or is simply missing.Mérida a town roughly 680 kilometers (422 miles) from Caracas is a popular tourist location.Authorities have said that 48 whales near Christchurch, New Zealand were beached yesterday. Fifteen of them died, although the other 33 were re-floated out to sea, according to a conservation official.The pilot whales beached themselves at Port Levy on South Island, but dozens of volunteers helped to try and get them back out to the open water out of the inlet, which is muddy and shallow. An alarm was called out at about 06.30 local time.This is the third mass stranding on the country's coast this summer; 125 pilot whales died in the two other beachings earlier, and another 43 were re-floated out to the ocean."It's a very, very shallow bay in Port Levy, very muddy, so whether they were chasing food and got caught in the shallows, we don't know," remarked department community relations manager Grant Campbell to the Associated Press. "We thought everything was OK, we checked them in the boat and then we woke up this morning and saw a whole lot on the beach here."Campbell also commented that the whales were up to five metres (seventeen feet) long, and some of the calves were between a metre and a metre and a half (three to five feet) long."We really just stood with them and as the tide came in and started floating, we were just able to push them out and away they went," said a local, Ted Haowden, as quoted by United Press International.Locals are expected to bury the dead whales this afternoon. According to Campbell, autopsies will be performed on two of the fifteen dead whales.Whales are frequently stranded on the beaches of New Zealand each summer, as they travel en route from Antarctica to breeding grounds. Scientists don't know why the whales become stranded.A Comair commuter jet crashed on takeoff from Lexington, Kentucky yesterday, killing 49 people on board and seriously injuring the plane's first officer, James M. Polehinke.The early-morning Flight 5191 was operating as Delta Connection and was headed from Lexington's Blue Grass Airport to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. It crashed about a mile west of the airport at 6:07 a.m. Eastern Time. The plane was a Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-100.Polehinke was taken to the University of Kentucky's Chandler Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the aircraft departed from a shorter runway than it was cleared to take off from.According to Gary Ginn, the Fayette County coroner, there was a significant fire on board the aircraft after impact, after which it continued to move forward several hundred yards before coming to a stop. The aircraft, however, is largely intact, Ginn said, and most of the passengers remained inside the cabin.  Ginn said he expects the cause of death to be fire for the majority of the victims. The tail number has been confirmed as N431CA.Based on information recovered from the flight's data recorder and physical evidence on the scene, the National Transportation Safety Board is focusing on the theory that the pilot attempted to take off from a 3,500-foot or 1067-meter runway that is not certified for airline traffic. That runway is only for general aviation aircraft.Investigators believe the plane did not get enough speed to lift off the ground before running out of runway. Air traffic controllers in the tower had cleared the flight for takeoff from an adjacent 7,000-foot or 2135-meter runway used for commercial airlines.Local police and fire fighters responded to the scene within minutes, and it has been reported that two off-duty police officers helped pull Polehinke from the cockpit of the burning jet.Laura Brown, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration told CNN that there is no indication that terrorism was involved in connection with the crash.Family members and friends who suspected that their loved ones may have been on Flight 5191 began arriving at Blue Grass Airport shortly after the crash. They have been taken to a local hotel, where staff from Comair as well as airport officials are caring for them and providing them with information. Comair has also set up a hotline where family and friends can receive information: the number is 1-800-801-0088.Among the dead were Jon Hooker and Scarlett Parsley, who had married just the night before and were off to their honeymoon.A moment of silence was held for the crash victims before the Los Angeles Dodgers-Arizona Diamondbacks baseball game in Phoenix, where Brandon Webb, a former University of Kentucky baseball teammate of Hooker, is a pitcher. Another passenger, Charles Lykins of Naples, Fla., wanted an early flight so he could get home to his two young children after visiting friends and family in the Lexington area, said Paul Richardson of Winchester. Mike Finley, 52, who lived in Corbin and owned the Finley Fun Centers, was headed to Reno, Nev., for a rollerskating convention, said his son, David Taylor. "I'd say there's thousands of kids who grew up with our father," he said.Rick Queen, who works for Turfway Realty in Lexington, said his father-in-law, Les Morris, was on the flight. Queen and Taylor were both frustrated with how Comair handled the families. "I just felt Delta ran families around this morning for three hours. I finally got some help from a Lexington firefighter," Taylor said.Flight attendant Kelly Heyer was single and lived in the Cincinnati area. He had been working for the airline since 2004 and was recently appointed base representative for the flight attendant union said Tracy Riley, a union secretary and fellow Comair flight attendant. "He was a standup individual," Riley said. "He was very professional, loved the job."Bornhorst described his own reaction as "complete devastation" and he lamented the frustration of the families as they awaited word. "When tragedies like this happen, information can just not be relayed fast enough and I certainly understand the frustrations related to that," Bornhorst said.Five passengers have died  and more than a dozen are injured after a bus bound for Montreal from New York City crashed through a guard rail in upper New York state on Monday evening.The Greyhound bus was heading north on Interstate 87 when it rolled over at around 6:45 pm before reaching Westport, New York, about half way between Albany and Montreal. Several passengers were still trapped two hours after the crash, according to the Plattsburgh Press Republican."All we did was try to comfort people," said Plattsburgh Mayor Daniel Stewart. "I also did a lot of French to English translation for police. Many on the bus were tourists returning to Canada."The dead include a 16-year old boy and 34-year old man, both from Montreal, and a 69-year old woman from an undisclosed Canadian location. The other two victims are both from New York State including the bus driver. Thirty-seven passengers were taken to Champlain Valley Hospital in Plattsburgh, New York, following the crash. Twenty-two were treated and released.Two passengers were have been transferred to Montreal General Hospital where they are in intensive care. Four others are in stable condition.  Reports suggest that the bus crashed through a guard rail after passing a truck, went down an embankment and rolled at least twice before landing upside down. The rear and top of the bus were crushed and one of its back wheels was turned inward. According to Don Jaquish, deputy director of the Essex County, New York Emergency Services, many of the passengers were thrown out of the bus and landed on a grassy area nearby.Major Richard Smith, Jr., of the New York State Police said that investigators believe a tire failure may have been a contributing factor in the crash. Survivors say they heard a loud bang before the bus lost control.Smith said that 48 of the 52 passengers on the bus sustained injuries. Greyhound Bus No. 4014 had been due to arrive in Montreal at 9:10 pm. Many of the passengers are believed to be from the Montreal area.The highway remained closed late Monday between Exits 30 and 31 in both directions.Family members can call Greyhound at 1-800-972-4583 for more information.An explosion in a coal mine in eastern Kentucky, located in the United States, killed 5 miners. One miner was able to walk out of the mine. The explosion occurred at Darby Mine No. 1, owned by Kentucky Darby LLC and located in Harlan County. Federal Mine Safety officials say the explosion happened sometime between midnight and 1 a.m. local time Saturday.According to Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher, they "don't know the details of the cause," of the explosion.The miners were part of a maintenance crew that was on duty during the time of the explosion. It is not known how many miners were inside the mine when the explosion happened; however, no mining was in progress when the explosion occurred.Rescue crews are on scene. The names of the miners are not known.The law issues have been actualized since 14 coal miners been killed in West Virginia in two accidents last January. A Senate committee endorsed bill would make coal mining safer by requiring miners to have at least two hours of oxygen available instead of one. Mine operators would also be required to keep extra oxygen packs accessible along escape ways in the mine. A temporary rule by the Mine Safety and Health Administration requiring coal operators to give miners extra oxygen was earlier issued but miners pressed Congress for a permanent legislation.5 people were killed in a bus crash involving a truck on the return trip from a band marching competition from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.The band director, his wife and granddaughter, the bus driver and a student were the five killed.30 others were injured in the crash.The bus was the first of four buses carrying 200 students home from the competition. The band was happy that they had placed third with their selection 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'.A Whole Foods Market truck had veered off the road and when it tried to get back it jackknifed and blocked all lanes of traffic, according to  Capt. Doug Notbohm, the northwest regional commander for the Wisconsin State Patrol.The truck driver did not sustain life-threatening injuries and was questioned by investigators at the scene of the accident.Weather was not a factor, and toxicology tests were administered, said Notbohm.At least 400 worried parents and students went to the school to gather information about the accident. Counselors and clergy were present to help cope with the rising emotions.Five people were killed today and several more injured when a ferry carrying 260 passengers caught fire off Mindoro island's Paluan Bay in rough seas. One of those killed was a five-year-old girl. The bodies of the deceased were taken to Pasay City. The wooden-hulled ferry was completely destroyed by the fire and sank as a result.Rear Admiral Damian Carlos of the Philippine Coast Guard told reporters that the fire started in the cargo hold of MV Cataleen-D about 5 a.m. local time (2100 UTC yesterday), and the first distress signal was received by authorities at approximately 8 a.m. He went on to speculate that a cigarette or spontaneous combustion may have caused the blaze.When the captain realised the firefighters were unable to contain the blaze he steered the vessel towards the Mindoro shoreline.Most of the passengers and crew jumped into the safety of the sea when they saw that other parts of the ship had been engulfed by flames. The majority of them suffered burns to their faces. The first Coast Guard ship that responded was BRP Pampanga, with local fishing vessels saving around a hundred of those in the water. Carlos said of the Coast Guard, “It was a good thing that the rescuers were on a mission in Corregidor.”The ship was owned by Manila-based San Nicolas Shipping Lines and captained by Danilo Faeldog. It had departed from Pier 2 at the Manila North Harbor around 7 p.m. Saturday, and was destined for Coron, Palawan.It is the second disaster to strike San Nicolas Shipping Lines. In 2004 the MV San Nicolas sank after a collision with a WGA Super Ferry vessel. The San Nicolas was carrying 203 passengers, of which 25 were fatally injured.The Coast Guard has initiated a full investigation into the cause of the disaster. The Maritime Industry Authority is expected to conduct its own investigation via the Board of Marine Inquiry. Carlos said the vessel's owner, identified as Samuel Nicolas, and anyone else found responsible could be charged with "reckless imprudence resulting in possible homicide."A train carrying 200 people has crashed into a pick-up truck in Netanya, Israel. At least 75 people are injured and at least five have died. Police say that the truck was pushed onto the tracks by another car when the train smashed into it. The driver was not injured."A train travelling from Tel Aviv to Haifa struck a truck at ... a junction. As a result of the impact, the first three carriages of the train were derailed. We are dealing with a large number of casualties," said a spokesman for the Israeli Police.Witnesses say that the driver of the truck managed to escape before the train hit the vehicle "crushing" it in the process."I'm not sure why (the truck) got stuck, but its two front wheels got caught. The driver got out before the crossing gate came down. ... The train just continued steaming ahead with the truck, and the truck was crushed," said Miri, a witness on the scene.The train was traveling from Tel Aviv to Haifa.An earthquake that rated 5.1 on the Richter scale hit north of Tokyo, Japan on 16 October.The quake was centered 40km underground, in the southern Ibaraki Prefecture.The high-rise builidings shook but no major damage was reported and only two people were injured. No tsunami warning was issued Local and bullet train services stopped to check the tracks but service quickly resumed.Services at Tokyo's Haneda Airport were disrupted by there were no major delays.The earthquake was rated 4 out of seven on the Japanese seismic scale and affected certain areas of the  Ibaraki, Tochigi, Saitama, Tokyo and Kanagawa prefectures.Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries, with a tremor occurring at least every five minutes. Located in the Ring of Fire arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches partly encircling the Pacific Basin, Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. Every year, there are up to 2,000 quakes that can be felt by people.As residents of the Big Island of Hawaii continue to make preparations for Hurricane Flossie, a 5.3 magnitude earthquake rocked the Big Island at 7:38 p.m. local time last night. The earthquake jolted an area about 20 miles south of Hilo. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the earthquake, as of late Monday night. However, Tom Brown, a spokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense did report that the quake caused a small landslide. Parts of Hawaii are already under hurricane watches, tropical storm warnings, and flash flood watches as Hurricane Flossie approaches. Public and private schools alike closed early Tuesday morning as residents and visitors were warned to stock up on food and water. Meteorologists predict the eye of the category three storm will pass less than 100 miles from the islands, leaving parts of Hawaii exposed to strong winds and up to 15 inches of rain. However, meteorologists also express caution in saying that even a slight change in course could take the storm closer to land.The Hawaii National Guard has been activated under the command of Governor Linda Lingle, who signed an emergency disaster proclamation ahead of the storm. Mayor Harry Kim also declared a state of emergency on Monday. The last time a hurricane struck the state was in 1992, when Hurricane Iniki devastated the island of Kauai. Six people were killed and over $2.5 billion in damage was caused.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 5.6 earthquake, lasting about 30 seconds, struck at 20:04:54 (PDT) on October 30, 2007, with the epicenter being five miles north, northeast of Alum Rock California and nine miles northeast of the center of San Jose.  The actual coordinates given by USGS put it along the border of San Jose and Milpitas in the hills near neighborhoods in both cities. The quake was felt as far away as the California communities of Sacramento, Sonoma, and Los Banos. It was the most powerful quake in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley since 1989.At least ten aftershocks had been reported by 8:35 p.m with magnitudes ranging from 1.3 to 1.8.Phone service, including cellular phone service, was reported to be down in some areas around the epicenter. Residents and business owners also reported their homes shaking.According to the USGS, damage could be "moderate to heavy" and Rafael Abreu of the USGS said that the earthquake is considered "moderate," but so far there are "no injuries." The quake was reported at a depth of 9.2 km (5.7 miles).USGS predicts a 30% chance of strong (magnitude >5) aftershocks in the next seven days, with a 5-10% probability of aftershocks stronger than the main quake. Additionally, USGS predicts approximately 15-40 small (magnitude 3-5) aftershocks.The USGS reports that the quake was centered on the Calaveras Fault, and was the most powerful earthquake on that fault since the 1984 Morgan Hill earthquake.An aftershock with a magnitude of 5.6 shook Central Italy on Tuesday, nearly 48 hours after a major 6.3 quake hit the country.  Earlier in the day, another aftershock of 4.2 was also reported.  The death toll from the quakes has now surpassed 200 with thousands of others injured.  At least one person was killed in the aftershock.The aftershock caused two apartment blocks to collapse in the city of L'Aquila, and slabs of masonry fell from other damaged buildings. Local media reported that an old church and many houses were also damaged. The shaking was felt as far away as Rome.Francessco Rocha, the head of the Italian Red Cross, estimated that 20,000 people had lost their homes, and it may be many months before they can return to them."The victims so far are 207," said the premier of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, at a press conference. "Of these victims, 190 have been identified while other 17 remain unidentified, 15 people are missing and there are more than 1,000 injured, 100 of which are in serious conditions," said Rocha."Civil protection men are working hard and for the next 48 hours rescuers will search for other survivors," added Berlusconi. "More than 7,000 men are at work. These people risk their lives and I want to congratulate myself with them, they are doing an extraordinary job considering the frequent ground movements complicate rescuing operations. Already 150 people have been extracted and saved from the ruins."The 6.3-magnitude quake on April 6 is the deadliest quake to strike Italy since November 23, 1980. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in a magnitude 6.8 earthquake that struck Southern Italy in the Irpinia region. At least 10,000 were injured in that earthquake, with over 300,000 being left homeless.An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck the Andean mountains of Peru on Monday, although Civil Defense officials said no damage was reported.The tremor occurred at 17:52 local time, or 22.52 UTC, with the epicenter located in the Huanuco region of Puerto Inca. The United States Geological Survey said the epicenter struck at a depth of 53.4 miles (95.3 kilometers) and was centered about 240 kilometres (150 miles) northeast of the city of Huanuco and (300 miles) northeast of the nation's capital of Lima.The El Comercio newspaper commented that the residents of Huanaco rushed out into the streets when the earthquake began, but there wasn't any damage.A dozen earthquakes in Peru with magnitudes of four or more have occurred since the beginning of this year, and about a hundred such quakes are recorded yearly, according to the Earth Times. Last year there were 140 quakes with a magnitude of 4.0 or above.In August 2007, a 7.9 earthquake struck the Ica province, just south of the capital. About 600 people were killed as a result, and much damage was caused to nearby infrastructure and buildings.At 10:49 PST (18:49 UTC) yesterday the United States Geological Survey reported that a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was felt in {{w|San Diego, California|San Diego]] and southern California down to Tijuana, Mexico.  There was also a 4.8 magnitude aftershock recorded at 10:53 PST.  The epicenter of the quake is believed to be near the Mexican city of Mexicali.The Southern California area had been experiencing lesser magnitude earthquakes for the past week, ranging in magnitude from  2 to 3. The earthquake occurred about 4.3 miles into the earths crust, which is considered shallow.  Shallow earthquakes often cause more damage than deeper ones. No major damage has been reported at this time, and the California Highway Patrol has not reported any major disruptions on local roads.  Minor damage to the Imperial County Administration Building in El Centro, California has been reported. The San Diego City Hall building shook for about 30 seconds after the quake, according to the XETV. In Mexicali, buildings were evacuated, and some traffic lights are not working, said Mexicali journalist Sergio Haro.A strong aftershock of the March 11 Pichilemu earthquake occurred today, at 12:29:49 local time (16:29:49 UTC), National Emergencies Office of Chile reports.

There were reported power outages in Lolol. Telephone calls were truncated for a few minutes in O'Higgins Region. No infrastructural damage or casualties have been reported.According to BBC News, eight aftershocks have occurred along the coast of O'Higgins Region, between magnitudes of 3.1 and 3.7.Another strong aftershock hit Chile early Sunday morning. The aftershock reached a magnitude of 5.9 with the epicenter located nineteen kilometers west of Pichilemu, according to the University of Chile Geological Survey (UCGS).The UCGS has also reported that the quake reached a depth of 30.1 kilometers and that the intensities in the Mercalli scale were: Pichilemu, Navidad and Talca: VI; Rancagua, Santa Cruz, Lolol and San Fernando: V; Casablanca, San Antonio and Santo Domingo: IV; La Calera, La Ligua, Limache, Los Andes, Papudo, Petorca, Quillota, Santiago de Chile, Valparaíso and Viña del Mar: III.However, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that it reached a magnitude of 5.8; had a depth of 8,5 kilometers; and that the epicenter was located 65 kilometers at the southwest of San Antonio, Valparaíso; 100 kilometers at the west of Rancagua, O'Higgins 105 kilometers at the northwest of Curicó, Maule and; 135 kilometers at the southwest of Santiago, Metropolitan Region.ONEMI (National Emergencies Office), reported that Talca, located 258 kilometers south of Santiago, was the city where the aftershock was felt the strongest. Pablo Marín of ONEMI told TV Chile no casualties were reported and only some telephone lines had collapsed.More than eight aftershocks hit the area, has reported the University of Chile Geological Survey. On Sunday:at the 14:52:31 local time (18:52:31 UTC), magnitude 3.3, reached a depth of 15 kilometers with epicenter three kilometers at the northwest of Pichilemu;at 15:22:57 (19:22:57 UTC), magnitude 4.3, had a depth of 32.6 kilometers with the epicenter nineteen kilometers northwest of Pichilemu;at 15:46:29 (19:46:29 UTC), magnitude 4.7, with a depth of 29.7 kilometers, the epicenter was located fifteen kilometers north of Pichilemu;at 16:02:46 (20:02:46 UTC), magnitude 3.7, with a depth of 30.7 kilometers and the epicenter was located ten kilometers northwest of Pichilemu.On Monday:at 02:21:45 (06:21:45 UTC), magnitude 3.9, with a depth of 15.5 kilometers and the epicenter was located 2 kilometers east of Pichilemu;at 02:33:28 (06:33:28 UTC), magnitude 4.6, with a depth of 15 kilometers and epicenter located 16 kilometers northwest of Pichilemu;at 02:49:25 (06:49:25 UTC), magnitude 5, had a depth of 9.2 kilometers and epicenter 16 kilometers northwest of Pichilemu;and at 11:43:35 (15:43:35 UTC), magnitude 3.6, depth of 28.7 kilometers and epicenter located 11 kilometers north of Pichilemu.As many as 50 people have been killed after a wooden ferry capsized in the Irrawaddy delta region of Myanmar on Sunday night, according to officials.The Nay Win Tun ran into an oil barge in the Irrawaddy delta, causing it to sink. The ferry, travelling from the town of Pathein to Thetkelthaung, is said to have had about 200 passengers on board at the time of the accident. The barge didn't sink, authorities said."The boat sank after colliding with an oil barge. We have recovered 34 bodies and there are at least another 16 people missing who are believed to have drowned. The other passengers were rescued from the water and have gone back to their home villages," said an unnamed official in the area.Another official commented that "there is very little chance of finding those missing alive. Most of them are women and children."Ferry accidents in Myanmar are not infrequent, as most of the country's population relies on old, frequently crowded water vessels for transportation, which are sometimes not well maintained.The  Kosi River changed course one week ago to a path which it has not taken for over 100 years. While 900,000 people were evacuated by rescue workers, new data has revealed that 50,000 people, from the town of Saharsa, have refused to leave their homes.Advertisements in local newspapers have been used to encourage the people who are still remaining in the area to leave soon. People are encouraged to go to one of many camps, which are funded by the government, to seek refuge from the continued flooding.People have also started to return to their homes, due to the fact that they have seen the water level drop by over half of a metre in some areas. This is despite statements by officials emphasizing that people may need to stay in the camps for up to six months.Approximately 1.2 million people are estimated to have had their homes flooded by the disaster. 42 people have been confirmed dead, although The Australian has reported that the actual death toll is likely to be much higher.The incident started when gushing waters quickly overflowed the channel boundaries on both sides at a rate of about 200 meters per day, flooding vast tracts in  Supaul,  Araria,  Saharsa,  Madhepura,  Purnia,  Katihar, parts of  Khagaria and northern parts of  Bhagalpur, as well as adjoining regions of Nepal. About 2.7 million people are affected by this flood disaster of massive dimensions, with about 900,000 people in the affected areas having moved to 285 relief camps and 249 health centers. An estimated 100,000 are still trapped in various villages without food or drinking water since several days ago when the crisis began.During the last 250 years, the Kosi has moved its path up to 150km westward on multiple occasions, leaving behind a series of paleochannels. The river is a tributary of the Ganges, with catchment areas in the Nepal Himalayas, one of the fastest rising mountain chains, flowing through a 150-kilometer wide and 180-kilometer long alluvial fan. Fast silting of the channels by the tons of annuvium brought down by the river makes it drift off so often that it is often cited as one of the text book examples of a dynamic river system to geologists.Philippine fishermen, volunteers and authorities with dozens of fishing boats have joined hands in guiding back to sea about 500 disorientated melon-headed whales that were stranded in the shallow waters near the mouth of Manila Bay delta in the Bataan Peninsula.The gentle mammals were first spotted swimming back and forth and straying very dangerously close (about a mile or 1.6 kilometers) to the shores of the coastal towns of Pilar, Orion and Abucay 135 kilometers northwest of Manila at around at around 4:00 am on Tuesday, said Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Commodore Luis Tuazon and Bataan Governor Enrique Garcia Jr.The Philippines Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) said its has responded to the reported mass "stranding" of whales off Pilar coastal waters in the province of Bataan where the famous and historic Corregidor Island is located. Using dozens of fishing boats with machines shut down and bare hands, more than 100 village fishermen and volunteers along with BFAR, local police and Philippine Coast Guard personnel have joined the massive rescue. With great difficulty, the emergency team has waded into the chest-deep water, clapping their hands and hitting the surface to guide and drive the whales farther away from the coastal shore to deeper waters."The mammals were at first thought to have been dolphins, but experts then identified them as melon-headed whales," local veterinarian Mariel Flores said. "This type of whale can be easily mistaken for dolphins because of their size and their teeth, which resemble those of dolphins. The mammals have ears that are sensitive to large changes in pressure underwater," she added."It looked like they never wanted to leave. They looked sad,” said Rodolfo Joson, a village councilor. Joson and his son, Joey, a fisherman like him, have rushed home at about 4 a.m. to report the pod sighting. “It was still dark when we waded into the water. The whales were about 200 meters from the shore. The water was up to my neck. We first checked their conditions by playing with them. They did not repel us or leave. They were making hooting sounds,” Joson explained the mass beaching. “It seemed they were running away from waters that they didn’t like. Dolphins are happy and strong creatures. They raced with ships,” he added.A post-mortem examination has revealed that four dead whales found beached farther up north in Abucay, Bataan, include two adult females, one of which was pregnant, while the other gave birth to a calf that also died, said Dr. Lemnuel Aragones of Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport who did the necropsy at the Bataan fisheries office in Balanga City.This is the first time that such large numbers of dolphins had been stranded in the Philippines. "We are trying to come up with a possible explanation to this unusual occurrence. It could be that the dolphins had lost their bearings and inadvertently ended up on the shallow portion of the coast unable to extricate themselves," said Dr Lemuel Aragones, Associate Professor at the UP Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology. Dr Aragones, who holds a PhD on Tropical Environmental Studies (Marine Ecology) from Australia's James Cook University, explained that "the melon-headed whales of the dolphin family have sophisticated navigation systems that operate on a principle similar to sonar instruments used in submarines. Like humans, dolphins also follow a 'leader' of their pod. It is possible that the leader of this dolphin [pod] had somehow lost its way. In turn, the leader’s acoustic system, which serves as its guidance system, might have been impaired," the marine expert elaborated.Dr Aragones said "BFAR, UPIESM, and the Ocean Adventure Marine Park in Subic started the Philippine Marine Mammals Stranding Network (PMMSN) in 2005 as a response to cetacean strandings or beachings." She cited the PMMSN training received by BFAR officers in Bataan during Tuesday's mass beaching. She has asked the government to release funds for marine mammal studies.The two adults had damaged eardrums, Alberto Venturina, the provincial veterinarian, said. "Dolphins with injured eardrums become disoriented, cannot dive for food and are too weak to swim and just flow with the current. If it's a sick leader, the animal needs to be identified and taken out of sight of the rest of the pod so the healthy dolphins could be prodded back to sea," he added."The two animals were identified as melon-headed dolphins, weighing about 250 to 300 kilograms (550 to 660 pounds)," explained Venturina, adding "the third dolphin was only a month old and measured barely a meter long. Its gender had not yet been determined."According to Nelson Bien, head of the Fisheries Resource and Management Division of BFAR Region III, a necropsy by BFAR, the provincial veterinarian, and veterinarians from the Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport has traced the cause of their death to drowning. The marine doctors have determined that the marine mammals might have drowned after failing to extricate themselves from the fishing nets or "baklad," explained Dr. Mundita Lim, director of the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau (PAWB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). “There were no injuries to their ears, like visible lesions, but the possibility of an acoustic problem or trauma is still there,” Dr Lim explained, saying, "more tests, like analysis of tissue samples and MRI tests will have to be done to see if there were other injuries to the animals not visible externally."They are sending tissue samples to the University of Philippines in Los Baños, Laguna for analysis. “If it was something like climate change, then it would be a bigger environmental problem,” Lim added.A fourth and pregnant one was also found dead in the village of Tortugas in the town of Balanga, Bataan, said Bien, saying they were investigating the incident and would conduct a “water quality and water parameter test” to determine why the dolphins beached to shallow waters. The condition of melon-headed whale found at Talisay River and taken to Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport has improved amid forced feeding and treatment of its 2 wounds, said Nilo Ramoso, Biologist III, Pawikan Conservation Project.Dr. Westly Rosario, BFAR Center chief in Dagupan City, has reported that BFAR personnel were also investigating a “problem in the water, probably chemical pollution,” to explain why the dolphins beached and sought shelter in the shallow waters. The dolphins have faced the same direction and their blowholes above water, they seemed to be avoiding something. “The dolphins were behaving in the same way, they have the same action. People were trying to drive them back into the sea but they refused. There could be chemical pollution somewhere which they were avoiding,” Rosario explained.Dolphins' disorientation is sometimes caused by the changes in earth's magnetic field “that cause the dolphins’ navigational mechanisms to go haywire,” Dr. Edgardo Gomez, professor emeritus of the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute, said, adding that "it could also be chemicals in the water that affected the dolphins, although this should be proven by water tests." Philippine marine biologist Rizza Salinas said a possible cause for the stranding of large pods of distressed whales is that there could have been illegal dynamite fishing in the area.“This is very strange. What is also unusual is they appeared disoriented. I am on my way to Bataan on board BFAR’s patrol vessel. We will look into the situation. Our patrol boats are also on their way to the area. We are also getting experts on stranding," said BFAR director Malcolm Sarmiento Jr. Sarmiento, explaining that the highest number of stranded dolphins recorded by the BFAR was only 20 to 30. "It's something unusual. It's the first time that such a large pod has entered Manila Bay, and is acting strangely," Sarmiento added."Most strandings are caused by seaquakes, heat wave or disturbances at sea. Such disturbances affect the pressure underwater, which subsequently affects the dolphins’ eardrums and sense of balance, leading to their "disorientation." The creatures then will avoid diving in deeper parts of the ocean and will swim to shallow areas. They came from the north and were headed towards the South China Sea," Sarmiento explained, adding that the unusual occurrence may have also been caused when the pod could have been following a sick or injured leader.Sarmiento has appealed to the public not to inflict harm on the dolphins, which are considered threatened species. "Please do not harm the dolphins because they are already endangered. The authorities should also prevent the people who want to inflict harm on the creatures. They should be arrested, if needed." Melon-head dolphins are considered threatened species — meaning they are likely to become endangered in the future. "At around 12 noon, the dolphins were finally guided to the open seas, but residents in Hermosa near Mariveles were surprised to see the dolphins near their shoreline, but around 4:30 pm, all the dolphins have left the shoreline and swam towards into deeper waters," said Governor Garcia."The dolphins swam parallel back to Abucay, Hermosa, and Manila Bay before they were eventually herded farther offshore. There are theories that this phenomenon was a result of the Monday night lunar eclipse. The Fisheries Bureau will know after their tests,” Garcia added. Having suspected the dolphins’ habitat must have been disrupted, forcing them to flee and seek refuge in shallow waters, Senate of the Philippines Majority Leader, Juan Miguel Zubiri on Tuesday asked experts to probe the cause of the sudden appearance of more than 300 electra dolphins near the shores of Pilar town in Bataan province Tuesday morning.Senator Zubiri wanted the experts to examine the possibility that an earthquake study, involving an undersea experiment using blasting in the South China Sea by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (L-DEO) - a collaborator of Columbia University - caused the abnormal behavior of the small whales.Citing an International Union for Conservation of Nature research concluding that the melon-headed whales may have been distracted by the South China Sea study, forcing the dolphins to wander in the shallow waters, Senator Zubiri said that “the earthquake study is a sea floor investigation project in the exclusive economic zone that includes Taiwan, China, Japan and the Philippines for its earthquake research. On top of saving stranded dolphins, we should find the cause for the tragedy in order to avoid them in the future and to be prepared when it occurs again," he explained.But according to Erlinton Olavare, Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) science research specialist, “no significant event was recorded by their stations in Bolinao, Sta. Cruz and Lubag, near Pilar at the time the dolphins were stranded Tuesday."Department of Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Jose L. Atienza, Jr. said Bataan Gov. Enrique “Tet” Garcia on Wednesday confirmed there was dynamite fishing in his province. “I asked him [Garcia] and he confirmed it. He also said he was battling this illegal activity,” said Atienza. “The causes of the acoustic trauma could have been sound waves caused by dynamite fishing or sounds emitted by passing ships or seaquakes,” Gov. Garcia said. "Dolphins are a 'cohesive' group and that they follow where their leader takes them. If the leader of the dolphins was sick, then the animal could have committed a “navigational error” and led the rest of the group to shore," said the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS)."The pod of melon-headed whales (dolphins) on Manila Bay were injured by a rather nasty group of more than 120 undersea earthquakes. The swarm started with a small magnitude-4.5 event on December 21, 2008. Things got red-hot on January 3, 2009 when a magnitude-7.6 event erupted near the water’s edge on Papua Island in Indonesia, 700 miles southeast of Davao City in Mindanao. The 7.6 magnitude quake was followed by more than 120 major aftershocks each one capable by itself of inflicting injury on a pod of dolphins," said Capt. David Williams, a retired marine mammal researcher, a commercial sea captain for 40 years and active whale conservationist. Capt. Williams explained that whales and dolphins have small air sacs (pterygoid sinuses) that surround each inner ear and help then sense sound direction underwater. A damaged pterygoid air sac results in the loosing of echonavigation and echolocation. "In summary, my Seaquake Theory indicates that barotrauma, as a result of exposure to potent earthquake-induced changes in ambient pressure, solves the centuries-old mystery of why whales and dolphins mass-strand on beaches around the world," Capt. Williams concluded.An explosive blast and explosive decompression create a pressure wave that can induce barotrauma. The difference in pressure between internal organs and the outer surface of the body causes injuries to internal organs that contain gas, such as the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and ear.According to the Natural History Museum experts, whale and dolphins can become confused, mis-read the Earth's magnetic fields, fear certain sounds and get lost. Since 1913, it has investigated all strandings, more than 11,000 so far, and it runs the UK Whale and Dolphin Stranding Scheme. New Zealand's Project Jonah has claimed that the largest recorded beach stranding was in 1918 when 1,000 pilot whales were stranded on New Zealand's Chatham Islands. The last mass beaching in the Philippines was in 1956 when around 12 sperm whales were stranded in a coastal area in Capiz, amid at least 10 yearly strandings that happened in the country involving only one or two animals that were either sick or dying.Last January this year, Filipino fishermen have also rescued an endangered sea cow. The fishermen aided the beached sea cow to the deep sea, according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature.The Melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra; many-toothed blackfish and electra dolphin) is a cetacean of the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae). As small members of the dolphingroup, it is closely related to the Pygmy Killer Whale and Pilot Whale, and collectively these dolphin species are known by the common name blackfish.The tender mammal can grow up to 2.7 meters (9 feet) and weigh as much as 210 kilograms (460pounds). With black triangular “mask” on its face, it appears dark gray to black in color, has no discernible beak and its head is shaped like a rounded melon, thus the name. Its primary diet is squid and fish. The Melon-headed whale lives well off-shore in all the world's tropical and sub-tropical oceans. At the northern fringes of its range it may also be found in the warm currents of temperate waters. Ordinarily, however, it is found beyond the continental shelf between 20° S and 20° N. The Melon-headed whale is widespread throughout the world's tropical waters, although not often seen by humans on account of its preference for deep water. It has been found in Ireland, Hawaii and Cebu, in the Philippines.As social species, they are covered by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 in the United States. In July 2004, between 150 and 200 melon-headed whales occupied the shallow waters of Kauai island in Hawaii for over 28 hours, after which, they were rescued and guided to deeper water. This incident may have been related to nearby United States Navy sonar exercise. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which includes the melon-headed whales in its Red List of threatened species said that the number of whales involved in mass stranding had increased in the last 30 years."The melon-headed whales are likely to be “vulnerable” to loud sounds, such as those generated by navy sonar and seismic exploration. Evidence from stranded whales also has indicated that they may have died after swallowing plastic items. It has been predicted that the whales will be affected by global climate change, but the impact is still unclear," the IUCN explained.A stampede in a stadium in Yemen, where President Ali Abdullah Saleh was holding a pre-election rally, killed at least 51 people and more than 230 were injured.Most of the dead are children as some 150,000 people had gathered. The stampede occurred when people where trying to leave after Saleh finished his speech.The incident happened at Ibb, about 180 kilometers south of Yemen's capital, Sanaa.Saleh has said family members of the victims will be compensated with a monthly salary.Saleh who reversed his earlier decision not to re-run for elections has been in power since 1978 as President of North Yemen and then head of the unified Yemen after North and South merged in 1990. First independent elections were held in 1999 in Yemen.A bus carrying 60 passengers to a religious event in the Santa Catarina state of Brazil plunged over a cliff on Saturday evening. The driver reportedly lost control whilst approaching a curve, leading the bus to fall 400 metres into a wooded area just ten kilometres away from Joinville, the final destination. Whilst the cause of the accident is not yet confirmed, police believe that the brakes on the vehicle may have failed. Approximately 100 rescue workers, plus fifteen ambulances and a helicopter were on the scene; although, the accident happened at nightfall making access to the area difficult. President Dilma Rousseff expressed her condolences upon hearing the news, saying: "In this hour of pain of suffering, I want to extend my sympathies to the families and friends who have lost their dear ones."The roads that wind through the Dona Francisca mountain range are notoriously dangerous, with 110 fatalities on these roads in the past five years, according to police. Throughout the nation, with the World Health Organisation stating 43,000 people die annually in accidents on the congested and poorly maintained roads.The first funerals for the recovered victims are to take place Monday.A bus accident in the north of Tanzania located approximately 15 miles to the east of Mount Kilimanjaro killed at least 54 people and injuring 20 after falling into the Malala river. Police say that the bus was packed with too many people and witnesses claim the bus was speeding."There were some (people) that were standing, plus cargo on top...It is not allowed within the law because the bus's capacity is 26 passengers," said Arusha regional commissioner, Abbas Kandoro. He also said the bus had at least 74 people on board."The bus was carrying 74 passengers. Fifty four people have died," added Kandoro.A crane has been called in to assist in the rescue and police fear that more bodies will be found under the wreckage.The people were traveling from Arusha to Mererani.55 people were killed today after a mattress factory in Casablanca, Morocco was swept by fire. The fire initiated on the ground floor this morning and quickly engulfed the entire building.12 others were injured - seriously, according to the Irish Times - including one police officer. 100 firefighters were dispatched to the five-storey factory after the blaze broke out at 10 am local time. Earlier reports had indicated 25 deaths and eight people injured. MAP, the state news agency, is quoted by the Irish Times as saying the building was four storeys high, citing in turn city officials.The disaster occurred at the Rosamor Ameublements factory, which is located in the Hay Hassani area of the nation's economic centre. Of the 150 people the facility employed, around 60 were inside at the time.An official statement by city authorities shows that preliminary investigation indicates onsite chemicals were responsible for the fire's rapid spread, but no actual cause has yet been determined. A full inquiry has been launched to investigate the accident fully.Falcon Heene, a 6-year-old boy from Fort Collins in the US state of Colorado, has been found safe and unharmed after earlier reports said he boarded an experimental balloon the family was building and then floated away. The Larimer County sheriff announced during a press conference at 6:11 p.m. that Heene was found hiding inside a box in the family's attic above the garage.Earlier reports had said that Heene might have been inside a box attached to the bottom of the balloon, something authorities were focusing part of their search on. However, there were conflicting reports as to whether or not there was anything else attached to the balloon. The New York Times reports that the small compartment present on the bottom of the balloon when it landed, was the alleged box."It [the box] was damaged. Basically, it was folded over and damaged," said Larimer County sheriff spokeswoman, Kathy Messick to the Times.The balloon landed south of Prospect Springs. Police stated that they were searching for Heene based on what his two other brothers told authorities. A witness had earlier said that he might have seen something fall off the balloon on Weld County Roads 28, 41 or 43. Authorities were also looking into the possibility that Heene was never inside the balloon at all, and that he was hiding somewhere in his neighborhood to avoid punishment. This ultimately turned out to be true.Initial reports were that Heene allegedly climbed into the balloon in his backyard in Fort Collins at about 11:00 a.m. local time. He then detached the anchor and began to float away. Police later said in a press conference that the story came from Falcon's two brothers. Local residents were able to snap pictures of the balloon. Shortly after, a news helicopter was able to locate the balloon, which was initially flying at an altitude of 7,000 feet.The balloon was never meant to carry a human, according to Fort Collins police. "This balloon was never meant to actually carry anybody. It was just a family project they were working on. The little compartment where their son is in is very small and it's not attached very well."The Heene family lives in Fort Collins. The boy's father, Richard, is a storm chaser and scientist. One report said they were building the experimental balloon in an effort to help commuters get to work easier. Officials say it has the ability to fly at an altitude of 10,000 feet. It is reported to be about 20 feet long, covered in tinfoil and resembles a flying saucer. Richard and his wife Naomi previously appeared on an episode of the U.S. television show Wife Swap and Richard has appeared in several videos chasing storms and dust devils. One of those chases was previously featured on an ABC News report.A 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck Basyurt, in the Elazig province or eastern Turkey at 04:32 AM (02:32 GMT) on Monday. According to local Kandilli observatory, the quake struck at a depth of five kilometres; the epicenter was near Karakocan town in the same province.The pre-dawn earthquake killed at least 40 people and almost 100 were injured. The village of Okcular was worst hit, claimed the press secretary for the provincial governor, Ozcan Yalcin. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, nearly five hours later, a magnitude-5.5 aftershock hit the province. 40 other aftershocks followed shortly, the highest of them being 4.4 magnitude, according to sources.While no deaths were immediately reported, the government's crisis management center soon put the toll at seventeen with another 60 injured according to the officials at Ankara, the capital. It was soon confirmed that at least 39 were dead; the toll is expected to rise. At least four of the victims were children.Muammer Erol, the provincial governor of Elazig, stated Okcular, Yukari Kanatli and Kayali accounted for majority of the dead. He told CNN Turk that "villages consisting mainly of mud-brick houses have been damaged, but we have minimal damage such as cracks in buildings made of cement or stone".Okcular, the largest of the affected villages, accounted for at least seventeen of the dead. The village has a population of 800, and the majority of the dwellers live in mud-brick homes built on hillsides. About 25 to 30 houses were demolished in this village. "The village is totally flattened," Hasan Demirdag, local administrator, told NTV.Yadin Apaydin, the administrator of Yukari Kanatli, said his village had been severely affected. "Everything has been knocked down - there is not a stone in place," he told CNN's Turkey sister network, CNN Türk."Many houses have collapsed. Search and rescue teams have been sent to the area," said the prime minister's office in a statement. Injured people are being rushed to local hospitals according to sources. At least 100 people have been taken to hospital. Some who panicked after the first quake jumped from balconies or windows were injured. Rescue workers, consisting of policemen as well as civilians dug with shovels to rescue people from the debris. The Turkish Red Crescent is also sending tents and blankets to be distributed. Neighboring districts are providing ambulances to assist the victims. Cemil Cicek, deputy Prime Minister of Turkey has left for the disaster area. Health Minister Recep Akdag, Housing Minister Mustafa Demir and State Minister Cevdet Yilmaz are accompanying him.According to CNN Türk, the tremor of the earthquake was felt in the adjacent provinces of Bitlis and Diyarbakir, causing residents to panic. Turkey lies on highly active fault lines and earthquakes often hit the nation. A 7.4-magnitude earthquake in Istanbul killed 20,000 people in August 1999. Most of the earthquakes that hit Turkey are usually minor.A strong earthquake has once again struck Haiti, eight days after a 7.0 magnitude quake left much of the nation in ruins.The US Geological Survey said the latest tremor had a magnitude of 6.1 and was centered 59 kilometres from the capital Port-au-Prince, which was devastated by the initial quake. It occurred at 06.03 local time (11.03 UTC). There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the aftershock, which comes as an international aid effort is underway to help those affected by last week's powerful earthquake."People are still very traumatised here," said a reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency who was in Haiti when the aftershock struck. "It's 6.30 in the morning, but people have taken to the streets with whatever belongings they have. A lot of buildings did not collapse in the quake [a week ago] but they have cracks. We do not have any reports of damage yet."Officials estimate the initial earthquake killed about 200,000 people and affected three million — about a third of Haiti's population.  Haitian authorities said 75,000 have been buried in mass graves.Survivors have been living in makeshift camps on streets littered with debris and decomposing bodies. Doctors meanwhile are struggling to treat thousands of injured with limited resources.A magnitude 6.2 earthquake has struck in the Solomon Islands, the United States Geological Survey reports.The quake was centered roughly 53 km (33 miles) NW (313°) from Gizo, Solomon Islands and occurred at 06:34:46 (UTC) but no tsunami warning has been issued and there are no reports of any damage.This follows a magnitude 8.1 undersea earthquake three days ago that triggered a tsunami that killed at least fifteen people, including six children, in the Solomon Islands. A series of aftershocks have shaken the area since then. A smaller 6.0 magnitude quake was reported at 8:39:44 PM (EDT) and on Monday, two quakes of magnitudes 6.0 and 6.2 quake struck the same area, the second 70 km (45 miles) South East of Gizo, New Georgia Islands, Solomon Islands.A 6.2-magnitude aftershock struck a large part of central and southern Chile on Friday morning, but it caused no casualties or major damage, ONEMI reported.The aftershock took place at 06:03 local time (10:03 UTC), and according to the University of Chile Geological Survey, the epicentre was located 26 kilometers to the south of Arauco, 65 kilometers to the south of Concepción, and almost 580 kilometers from Santiago. It had a depth of 54.4 kilometers. However, the United States Geological Survey reported that the aftershock had a depth of 35 kilometers and that it reached a magnitude of 5.9.The Interior Minister, Rodrigo Hinzpeter, informed Radio Cooperativa there were no reports of casualties or damage caused by the aftershock.ONEMI reported on their website that the aftershock reached magnitudes of up to VI in the Mercalli scale, ranging from I to XII, in some towns in the Bío Bío Region. The aftershock provoked panic in the area. ONEMI specified that the intensities of the aftershock were: VI in Lota; V in Concepción, Parral and Angol; IV in Temuco, Lonquimay and Puerto Saavedra; and III in Linares, Retiro, Constitución, Valdivia and Panguipulli.At 06:14 (10:14 UTC), SHOA (Chilean Army Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service) ruled out the possibility of a tsunami in the affected area from Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region, until the Los Ríos Region.At 3:36am this morning, local time a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck about 10 kilometres southeast of Norcia, Italy. The quake hit at a depth of 10 kilometres, and was felt all the way to Rome, about 100 miles (150 km) away from the town of Norcia.120 or more people are dead, officials have said, including children, and around 100 people are reported missing. The death toll has risen over the course of the day, and is expected to rise further as scores of people remain unaccounted for. The 6.2 magnitude quake has effected the central towns of Norcia, Pescara del Tronto, Accumoli and Amatrice. Sergio Pirozzi, Amatrice's mayor, remarked, "Half the town no longer exists", as most of it has been reduced to rubble. Mayor Pirozzi went on to say rescue teams were digging with the "[hope] that most people were alive."After hearing about the devastating effects of the earthquake, Pope Francis postponed a weekly address on religious teachings, instead dedicating a prayer session in Saint Peter's Square for those affected by the disaster. "[L]earning that there are children among the victims, I am deeply saddened," Pope Francis told his public.  Authorities have compared today's earthquake in central Italy to the 2009 earthquake that killed over 300 people in Abruzzo, Italy. Italy's Civil Protection agency characterized  the earthquake as "severe".A strong earthquake struck the Atacama Region in Chile at 11:52 (14:52 UTC), provoking widespread hysteria. The United States Geological Survey reported that the tremor reached a magnitude of 6.2. The epicentre is located on the mainland 76 kilometers south of Copiapó and at a depth of 59 kilometers. However, the University of Chile Geological Survey reported that the seism reached a magnitude of 5.9.Thousands of inhabitants of Copiapó ran evacuation plans in offices and schools.  The seism set off many alarms in cars and enterprises, according to radio stations.  Parents went to take their children out of the schools.  It was reported earlier that cornices fell down from buildings, businesses lost merchandise and cellphone networks encountered problems in the area.The ONEMI reported no damages or injuries, but some roads collapsed. Power and water distribution were not affected. Eva Cansino, ONEMI boss, told TVN that the citizens' reactions demonstrated particular sensitivity to seisms, and she pointed out that it helps to minimize the risks in similar situations. She added that this seism was not an aftershock of the February 27 Maule or March 11 Pichilemu earthquakes, which destroyed many places in the central and south areas of Chile.Santiago felt the earthquake to a lesser degree. The earthquake was felt between the Antofagasta and O'Higgins regions.ONEMI also reported the intensities of the seism in three regions according to the Mercalli scale:Antofagasta: Taltal, III grades;Atacama: Copiapó and Tierra Amarilla, VI grades; Vallenar, V grades; Caldera, IV grades;Coquimbo: La Serena, V grades; Combarbalá and Río Hurtado, IV grades; Ovalle, III grades; and Punitaqui, II grades.Joaziel Jamett, from ONEMI, reported that the tsunami alert was discarded in the coast of the Atacama Region, at the 12:45 local time (15:45 UTC). "SHOA (Servicio Hidrográfico y Oceanográfico de la Armada de Chile / Chilean Army Hydrographic and Oceanographic Survey) has discarded any tsunami in the Atacama Region, therefore we have to keep the people quiet", reported Jamett to Bío Bío Radio.Today marks one month from the earthquake and tsunami combo that hit the most of Chile central and south part. This is the second seism that has occurred in the north of Chile in the last few weeks, after the 6.3 on March 4.Almost ten minutes before this earthquake, at 11:39:08 (14:39 UTC), another March 11 earthquake aftershock was felt between the O'Higgins and Bíobío regions. It reached 4.3 grades, and had a depth of 32.4 kilometers. The epicentre was located 16 kilometers at the southeast of Pichilemu. It lasted about 15 seconds. Another aftershock occurred at the 13:14 (16:14 UTC), reached 3.7 grades, had a depth of 10.8 kilometers, and the epicentre was located 12 kilometers at the east of Pichilemu. It lasted about 5 seconds.A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Papua New Guinea at 9:15 AM local time on Sunday morning (23:15 Saturday UTC). The epicentre was 30 kilometers east of Lae, and 300 kilometers north of Port Moresby the capital of Papua New Guinea. The quake had a depth of 66.2 kilometers (41.1 miles).The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii has not issued any alerts related to the quake, and so far no injuries have been reported. Papua New Guinea National Disaster Centre officials in Lae told Reuters that while they were unaware of any buildings collapsing, the people of Lae did feel the quake.Papua New Guinea is commonly hit by volcanic activity, earthquakes and tidal waves. Almost 3 years ago to this date, an earthquake with the same magnitude hit the area. On that occurrence no casualties were reported either.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 6.1 earthquake has struck Sumatra, Indonesia. The meteorological agency of Indonesia put the magnitude at 6.4.The epicenter was located 190 kilometers (115 miles) northwest of Bengkulu, Sumatra, Indonesia at 2:27 p.m. (local time) and had a depth of 35 k.m. (21.7 miles). A small magnitude 5.1 aftershock shook the same area just over two hours later.There are no reports of damage, injuries or death, but the USGS says that damage could be "moderate to heavy." No tsunami warning was issued.Last week, a magnitude 8.4 quake struck the same region killing at least 23 people and injuring over 100. That quake was followed by as many as 60 aftershocks for at least a week, with some ranging as high as magnitude 7.8.Another earthquake hit Chile on late Monday, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has reported. It occurred at 19:09:43 local time (23:09:43 UTC). The epicenter was located 110 kilometers northwest of Temuco; 132 kilometers southwest of Concepción; 203 kilometers north of Valdivia and 558 kilometers southwest of Santiago.The USGS later determined that the earthquake had a depth of 20.6 kilometers, and the epicenter was located 55 kilometers to the south of Lebu.The University of Chile Geological Survey reported that the earthquake took place 71 kilometers at the west of Tirúa in the Bío Bío Region and had a depth of 22.9 kilometers.Wikinews' Diego Grez reported that the earthquake was clearly felt in Pichilemu, almost 300 kilometers to the north of the epicenter. ONEMI reported no casualties. The area is being monitored by the organization. It has been reported that some telephone lines have collapsed after the earthquake. More than two months after the major 8.8 earthquake, many people continue to live in tents or temporary huts.A strong, 6.4 magnitude earthquake stuck Indonesia on Friday, even as recovery efforts continued from the devastating tremors that hit there last month. The earthquake caused some buildings to sway in the country's capital, Jakarta; however, there were no reports of injuries. According to officials, the earthquake's epicentre was in in the Sunda Strait, off the western coast of the island of Java.The earthquake wasn't powerful enough to generate a tsunami, according to a Meteorology and Geophysics Agency official, Suhardjono.On September 30, a powerful magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Indonesia, causing landslides, destroying buildings, and killing over a thousand people. Cleanup and recovery efforts for that quake are still ongoing. Tremors frequently strike Indonesia and neighbouring vicinities, as it is positioned on an arc of fault lines.An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 hit Iran yesterday. The earthquake was centered around the southeastern town of Zarand, about 440 miles away from the capital, Tehran. Early reports indicate at least 40 villages with a combined population of 30,000 people have been damaged, with 420 deaths and slightly less than a thousand injured. Earthquakes are nothing new to Iran, with one in the nearby desert city of Bam killing 31,000 people in December 2003. Heavy rain and bad visibility have made early relief efforts difficult; despite this some 1,500 members of the Iranian Red Crescent have begun organising camps for the newly homeless.A powerful 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit southern Taiwan on Thursday. According to USGS the epicenter was 23.1 km (14.4 miles) deep. The quake struck at 8:18 a.m. (0018 UTC) in a mountainous region on the southeast coast and 40 miles east of cities of Tainan and Kaohsiung on the southwest coast. The earthquake was felt in capital Taipei which is 155 miles north of the epicenter.Several fires were started and Taipei's high-speed railway lines were stopped and are undergoing safety checks. CTI news agency reported one person was injured by falling debris in Kaohsiung, and one woman was hospitalized in the southern city of Chiayi. One person was hurt by a falling tree according to Central News Agency.A spokesman for Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou assured that the concerned authorities had been instructed to follow the situation closely and take steps so as to alleviate the damage caused and survey the dislocation. The Ministry of Defense has dispatched troops to report on the damage. The Taiwan Ministry of Interior and the National Fire Agency said electricity was cut off near the epicenter but further information was not possible.The quake was followed by many aftershocks, the largest of 4.8 on the Richter scale. Kuo Kai-wen who is the director of the Central Weather Bureau's Seismology Center denied presence of any geological relations between the Chile earthquake and this earthquake in Taiwan.A 6.4 moment magnitude earthquake has hit near the Andaman Islands, Bay of the Bengal, India, on Tuesday at 1:21:48 AM local time (Monday 19:51:48 UTC), USGS has reported.The earthquake had a depth of 127.7 kilometers (79.4 miles). The epicenter was located 120 kilometers southeast of Port Blair, Andaman Islands; 350 kilometers north of Mohean, Nicobar Islands; 795 kilometers southwest of Bangkok, Thailand and 2580 kilometers southeast of New Delhi, India.No casualties or damage have been reported. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said there was a "very small possibility of a local tsunami near the centre" but no possibility of a destructive, widespread tsunami.[[File:6.5 Bio Bio earthquake 14 July 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Shakemap of the 6.5 magnitude aftershock. {{image source|[[United States Geological Survey]}}]]Another large aftershock of the February 27 8.8 earthquake — of 6.5 magnitude — rocked Chile earlier on Wednesday, the USGS reported. University of Chile Seismologic Service measured the aftershock's magnitude as 6.6.The aftershock occurred at 08:32:22 UTC (04:32:22 AM local time), at a depth of 28.4 kilometers (17.6 miles). Its epicenter was located 55 kilometers at the southwest of Lebu, Bío Bío Region; 100 kilometers at the northwest of Temuco, Araucanía Region; 100 kilometers at the southwest of Los Ángeles, Bío Bío; and 560 kilometers at the southwest of Santiago, Metropolitan Region.Wikinews reporter Diego Grez reports the aftershock was clearly felt in Pichilemu.  The aftershock lasted in about ten seconds.  Sergio Barrientos, Director of University of Chile Seismologic Service said that it is a "late aftershock" of the February earthquake.  "This seism is of the same type as February 27th, but much lighter," he said.Another aftershock, magnitude 5.1, took place at 20:36:08 local time (Thursday 00:36:08 UTC). It occurred at a depth of 44.3 kilometers (27.5 miles), and the epicenter was located 45 kilometers southwest of San Antonio, Valparaíso; 100 kilometers at the southwest of Valparaíso; 110 kilometers at the northwest of Rancagua, O'Higgins Region; and 125 kilometers at the southwest of Santiago.A 6.5 magnitude earthquake occurred in Acre, a Brazilian state, at 16:18:29 UTC (11:18 local time), United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported. It had a depth of 565.3 kilometers.The epicenter was located 125 kilometers east-southeast of Cruzeiro do Sul, Brazil, 330 kilometers east of Pucallpa, Peru, 460 kilometers south-southwest of Tabatinga, Brazil, and 2700 kilometers west-northwest of Brasilia, Brazil.A civil defence service spokesman in Cruziero do Sul reported to Times Live that the quake was unnoticed. "This zone suffers a lot of earthquakes, but the last one we really felt was 20 days ago. We didn't register any disorder or damage on the surface," he said."Generally speaking, quakes more than 500 kilometres deep don't leave signals in the surface, they are only detected by instruments," said an official of Brazil's Seismological Observatory to AFP.A magnitude 6.7 earthquake shook the Hawaiian islands at 17:07:49 UTC (07:07:49 local time) October 15, 2006. The quake, centered approximately 6 miles southwest of Puakō on the west side of Hawai`i Island (the Big Island), was felt throughout the entire state, causing a statewide power outage.No tsunami warning was issued as a result of the quake; however, a tsunami measuring around 0.1 meters (four inches) was recorded. There were 50 aftershocks reported after the quake, the strongest being a 5.8 tremor reported at about 17:14 UTC (7:14 a.m. local time).There were no fatalities reported and only scattered reports of minor injuries.Electric power was lost statewide shortly after the quake.  As of about 8:00 p.m. HST, power was restored to all the neighbor islands, but Hawaiian Electric personnel still had work to go on Oahu, the island with the highest population.  Power was eventually restored to most areas of Oahu by midnight.  Structural damage occurred at Kona Hospital, where ceiling tiles fell and electricity was lost, forcing an evacuation of patients to Hilo Medical Center on the other side of the island.  Damage was also reported at the Honokaa Long-term Care Facility and the Royal Kona Resort. Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle, who was in Kona at the time of the earthquake, issued an emergency declaration for the entire state of Hawaii at about 11:00 a.m. local time (2300 UTC Sunday).Air service in Hawaii was temporarily suspended shortly after the quake as airports were forced to operate on emergency power.  The power outage caused delays to incoming and outgoing flights, as TSA agents had to conduct manual searches of all bags.  Airlines have canceled numerous flights scheduled to depart Honolulu International Airport Sunday evening. Communication links are problematic.  Most radio stations lost power and stopped broadcasting immediately after the quake. (Metroblogging Hawaii) Honolulu radio station KSSK, operating on emergency generators, became a central information source for Oahu residents. A landslide has blocked at least one major highway from a section of a cliff at Kealakekua Bay.USGS Volcano Observatory equipment has not been significantly damaged. Monitoring stations report "no significant changes in the past 24 hours" of the eruption of the Kīlauea volcano. According to USGS records, this earthquake is the fourth largest Hawaiian earthquake in the last 100 years. Previous earthquakes include a magnitude 7.2 quake in 1975, a magnitude 6.9 quake in 1951, and a magnitude 6.8 quake in 1938.  The last magnitude 6.7 quake was in 1983.The United States Geological Survey says that a sizeable earthquake has occurred less than 140 kilometres (83 miles) from the Northeastern coast of Papua New Guinea. The initial indication from the USGS is that the earthquake registered at magnitude 6.8 at a depth of just 16.8 kilometres (10.4 miles). It struck at 23:38 UTC (09:38 PGT) offshore between the areas of Wewak, the capital city of East Sepik and Madang, the capital city of the Madang Province. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a minor tsunami warning, stating "[n]o destructive widespread tsunami threat exists based on historical earthquake and tsunami data. However, earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within 100 kilometres of the earthquake epicentre."First reports from the area indicate no casualties and little or no localised damage.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 6.8 struck just of the coast of Colombia at 01:49 (UTC) with a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). The epicenter was located 150 km (95 miles) north, northeast of Tumaco, Colombia. There are reports of power outages in some cities, but there are no reports of damage to buildings, deaths or injuries. The USGS says that some "moderate" damage may exist near the coastline of southwest Columbia.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has not issued a tsunami warning saying there is "no destructive widespread tsunami threat based on earthquake historical data," but that "small waves could be generated locally."At least 400 people have been killed and a further 10,000 injured by a magnitude 7.1 earthquake and its aftershocks which struck remote and mountainous Yushu county, in the south of Qinghai province in the west of China. An official for the town of Jiegu (Gyêgu), the county seat, which was one of the worst-hit locations, said that "the death toll will definitely go up."The USGS reports the tremors started at 07.49 local time (23.49 UTC). The epicentre was 240 kilometres north-northwest of Qamdo, Xizang, and 375 kilometres south-southeast of Golmud, Qinhai, at a depth of ten kilometres. The China Earthquake Networks Center, however, conflicted the USGS statistics, putting the earthquake's magnitude at 7.1.A local official, Huang Limin was quoted by the Chinese Xinhua news service as saying: "Soldiers have been dispatched to save the people buried in the collapsed houses." Authorities have ordered supplies to be moved to the area, but Yushu is hundreds of miles away from any airport, according to the BBC.The USGS also reported there was a 5.8 magnitude aftershock hit the same area about an hour and a half later, at 09.25 local time (01.25 UTC).The head of news for the Yushu county television station, who was a witness to the quake, spoke to the state broadcaster CCTV about the incident, saying "In a flash, the houses went down. It was a terrible earthquake. In a small park, there is a Buddhist tower and the top of the tower fell off." He said that residents fled after the tremors began."Everybody is out on the streets, standing in front of their houses, trying to find their family members," he added.Another official commented that around 85% of the buildings in the town of Jiegu, located close to the quake's epicentre, were destroyed, saying that "the streets in Jiegu are thronged with panic - injured people, with many bleeding in the head."Many students are buried under the debris due to building collapse at a vocational school. I can see injured people everywhere. The biggest problem now is that we lack tents, we lack medical equipment, medicine and medical workers." The plateau where the earthquake hit is frequently visited by tremors; however, there are rarely many casualties due to its remoteness and small population. However, in May 2008 a heavy 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Sichuan foothills, killing 80,000 people.An earthquake hit close to the Solomon Islands, in the early hours of Thursday morning. It was about 184 kilometres from Lata and 487 kilometres from the capital Honiara.  The US Geological Survey has stated that Tsunami warnings are yet to be released and that no major damage occurred. The quake was 6.9 in magnitude and hit a depth of 19 kilometres. It was then followed by a smaller 4.9 magnitude aftershock. The geographical position of the Solomon Islands places them in ‘the ring of fire’, an area of tectonic activity in the basin of the Pacific Ocean that is subject to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."This is one of the most active seismic regions in the world -- in the last three years we have had 30 plus earthquakes of over 6.0 magnitude," Geoscience Australia Duty Seismologist Marco Maldoni told AFP.According to a report from the Red Cross today, about 60 people were still missing after a house collapsed during a heavy rain storm on Friday in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.Ten were known dead on Saturday, and a surviving man was dug out of the house after ten hours. The house was reportedly just two years old and had at least six floors.  Local building has widespread problems with poor materials and not following Kenyan construction rules.Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said on Saturday, hospitals had treated 80 people.Another seven people reportedly died in the storm.  Kenya's Red Cross said the flooding affected more than 800 homes.The incident happened Monday night, according to the railroad company, Chemin de Fer Congo-Ocean. The incident is believed to have occurred as the train rounded a curve in a remote part of the Congo, around 37 miles (60 km) from Pointe-Noire. Four railcars are reported to have fallen into a ravine.A spokesperson for the government, Bienvenue Okiemy, said that "excess speed" had been the cause of the derailment.Officials said 60 bodies have been recovered, and a further 450 people are being treated for injuries at a hospital in Pointe-Noire. Okiemy commented that the death toll could still rise, "because searches and operations to lift wagons which fell into a ravine are still ongoing."  A railroad official said that "[t]he material damage was also very severe", adding that "[a]ll steps have been taken to organise relief."The incident is the third major train crash on the line in two decades. In 1991, a passenger train collided with a freighter, killing around 100 people, and in 2001, another collision killed around 50 people.A large pile-up on an Austrian motorway has left one woman dead and at least thirty - up to thirty-seven - people injured, five seriously. Ongoing storms depositing snow and ice across western Europe are believed to have contributed to the extent of today's accident which occurred between Vienna and Salzburg. The pileup involved at least 60 vehicles, and some reports say up to 70. It is thought the direct cause was a coach. Multiple trucks were also involved.Numerous people required cut free from their mangled vehicles at the site on the A1 autobahn westbound, which is now closed in both directions. The crash was between Seewalchen and St. Georgen, to the north-east of Salzburg. The weather is making it difficult for ambulances and search and rescue helicopters to approach the scene. The deceased was a Spanish woman living in Switzerland.The same storm has also caused a large number of road accidents in neighbouring Switzerland, which saw 70 centimetres (28 inches) of snow on Sunday with four metre (13ft) drifts. Hundreds of tourists are trapped in the Aeolian Islands near Scicily, Italy after five metre waves prompted a two-day suspension of ferry services and destroyed roofs. In the Netherlands traffic jams reached a total of 836 kilometers (519 miles) long and Amsterdam's Schipol Airport saw delays while snow was shoveled off runways. Macedonia saw one fatality in the storms and Germany has also seen much snowfall.Seven people died and 50 others were injured during a fire at Bangladesh's largest shopping mall on Friday.  The dead include six security guards, three of whom were found in an elevator. The seventh was an employee with the mall fire fighting unit who died from injuries in the hospital. Survivors on the rooftop were rescued by Bangladesh Air Force helicopters. Shoppers fled the mall. The 22 story Basundhara City Complex in Dhaka has more than 2,000 shops and restaurants. It is not known how many were in the mall nor the exact death count. Flames and smoke billowed from the top floors of the mall.Fifteen fire trucks were dispatched to the fire. Due to high winds and no ladders which would reach the 18th floor, the blazing inferno took between seven to ten hours to extinguish. The fire began in the Basundhara offices on the 18th floor.A 7.0 magnitude earthquake has struck off the coast of Haiti earlier today at 21:53 UTC, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, no tsunami warning was issued, contradicting some media reports that said there was one in place. The quake's magnitude was revised down from an initial report of 7.3 on the Richter scale."A destructive widespread tsunami threat does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data," the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. "However, there is the possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a 100 km [60 miles] from the earthquake epicentre."The USGS reports that the epicentre was fifteen kilometres (ten miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince and 1,140 kilometers (708 miles) southeast of Miami, Florida, at a depth of ten kilometres.According to USGS analyst Dale Grant, this tremor was "the largest quake recorded in this area"; the last strong quake was in 1984, and had a magnitude of 6.7, he noted."Everybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken. The sky is just gray with dust," said Henry Bahn, an official with the US Department of Agriculture who was visiting in Haiti and a witness to the incident. "I just held on and bounced across the wall. I just hear a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance," he commented, as quoted by the Associated Press.According to data from the USGS, there were thirteen aftershocks after the initial tremors, the strongest of which was 5.9 on the Richter scale; seven others measured in at 5.0 or higher – all the aftershocks were 4.0 or greater.No deaths have yet been reported, but a hospital in Port-au-Prince was damaged, and a US government official said several houses fell into a ravine. An analyst for USGS in Colorado commented that there could be many deaths from an earthquake of this strength. "I think we are going to see substantial damage and casualties," he said.The USGS's Mike Blanpied remarked that about three million people were impacted by the earthquake, given its location. "This quake occurred under land as opposed to off-shore, so a lot of people were directly exposed to the shaking coming off that earthquake fault, which was quite shallow," he said.A lack of communications makes it difficult to ascertain what damage was done. US embassy personnel were "literally in the dark" due to power failures, said State Department spokesman P. J. Crowley. "They reported structures down. They reported a lot of walls down. They did see a number of bodies in the street and on the sidewalk that had been hit by debris. So clearly, there's going to be serious loss of life in this," he said, as quoted by AP. A reporter for Reuters said he had seen "dozens of dead and injured people" amidst collapsed buildings."We are trying to get in touch with our people on the ground but we are experiencing communication problems, which is not unusual in a disaster such as this," said United Nations spokeswoman Stephanie Bunker to Agence France-Presse.An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 Mw struck the Ryukyu Islands, off the coast of Japan on Friday morning at 5:31am (20:31 UTC). A tsunami warning had been put in place. The precaution was cancelled later. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no "destructive threat" from the tsunami. At its center, the depth of the earthquake had been measured at ten kilometers (6.2 miles).At 5:57am local time (20:57 UTC), the Japan Meteorological Agency recorded a ten centimetre (four inch) tsunami Nanjō, Okinawa. Initially the agency had predicted that the depth of the tsunami would be three feet (one metre). There were no reports of damage, although, according to the Agency, "there may be slight sea level changes from now on."The islands were advised to evacuate from the seashore were Okinawa Islands, Amami Islands and Tokara Islands. Ivan Brackin, a resident of Yoron Island, described his experience of the earthquake. "I woke up to violent shudders that lasted about six seconds then a pause followed by a couple of sharp jumps," he stated. "Jumpers are the most dangerous so that sent me under the desk."According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 7.1 quake struck Sumatra in Indonesia just after 4:00 a.m. local time.The epicenter was located 135 kilometers (85 miles) west of Bengkulu, Sumatra, Indonesia in the Indian Ocean, with a depth of 30 k.m. (18.6 miles).The NOAA issued a tsunami alert that was later lifted saying "no destructive widespread tsunami is expected," but that "local tsunamis can affect locations no more than 100 kilometers from the epicenter." They also state that lack of "sea level data" may delay the center's determination of whether or not a tsunami was generated.The USGS states that damage may be "light to moderate" but so far there are no reports of injures, deaths or damage.A powerful earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale has struck in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Fiji on Monday at 22:13 (10:13PM) (UTC).The quake hit 579 kilometers below the Earth's surface about 100 kilometers North East of Ndoi, the US Geological Survey said.No damage or injuries have been reported following the quake and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said they did not expect it to trigger a tsunami as the quake happened far below the Earth's surface.Lasarusa Veutibau, a seismologist at Fiji's Mines and Resources Department, said the quake was too deep to have been felt anywhere in the Fiji Islands.A strong earthquake struck central and southern Chile on Sunday evening. The earthquake reached a magnitude of 7.1, and occurred at 20:20:16 UTC (17:20:16 local time), at a depth of 16.9 kilometers, according to the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake was centered near the town of Tirúa; 70 kilometers northwest of Temuco, Araucanía Region; 90 kilometers south-southeast of Lebu, Bío Bío Region; 130 kilometers southwest of Los Ángeles, Bío Bío; and 595 kilometers south-southwest of Santiago, Santiago Metropolitan Region."At coastal locations which have experienced strong ground shaking, local tsunamis are possible due to underwater landslides," the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a statement. Radio Bío Bío reported that the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy had ruled out the possibility of a tsunami in Chilean coasts. However, according to ADN Radio, coastal zones are undergoing precautionary evacuations.The National Office of Emergency of the Interior Ministry reported that there were power outages, although some of these appear to have been controlled outages, where power was purposefully cut to access damage. The earthquake was felt from the O'Higgins Region to the Araucanía, in cities such as Rancagua and Talca. The earthquake was also reportedly felt in Temuco, where officials at the city's airport said it caused no damage. According to Vicente Núñez, director of ONEMI, this earthquake "is not related to the February 27, 2010 one."The University of Chile Seismological Service reported that the earthquake occurred offshore Lebu, 149 kilometers west of Tirúa, at a depth of 29.5 kilometers, and that it reached a magnitude of 6.5. The service later updated the magnitude to 6.9.Many aftershocks have been reported by residents in the area, although only one has been reported by the University of Chile Seismological Service: a magnitude 5.3 seism that occurred 54 kilometers northwest of Tirúa, at a depth of 32.1 kilometers."[I'm] arriving at the National Emergencies Office, [in order] to monitor consequences [of] tremors in the south and the needs of the people," President Sebastián Piñera (@sebastianpinera) said on Twitter. Piñera announced in a press conference that the National Emergencies Office "would be reorganized into a new agency."Several other seisms have occurred throughout the day in Chile: a magnitude 3.7, east of Valparaíso; a 4.7, and a 3.7 magnitude seism centered west of Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region; a 3.6 tremor centered northwest of Los Vilos, Coquimbo Region; and a 4.7 seism that occurred northwest of Talca, Maule.It was reported at 19:25 local time (22:25 UTC) that electricity has been restored almost completely in the Tirúa area.A large earthquake, measured by the US Geological Survey as having a magnitude of 7.2, struck near Sumatra, Indonesia earlier today.The epicentre was 215 kilometres (130 miles) south-southeast of Banda Aceh, Sumatra, and630 kilometres (390 miles) west of Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, at a depth of 45 kilometres (28 miles), the USGS reports. The tremors started at about 13.00 local time (05.59 UTC). A local tsunami alert was made by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, but rescinded about an hour and a half later."Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated. Therefore, the tsunami watch issued by this center is now cancelled," the PTWC said in a statement on its website.The Associated Press news agency quotes local media as saying some power lines were knocked down and some buildings damaged.The epicentre of the temblor is near that of 2004's magnitude 9.2 earthquake, which generated a large tsunami and killed around 170,000 people. Indonesia is on a very tectonically active part of the world, the Ring of Fire, and experiences earthquakes frequently.An earthquake of 7.2 magnitude on the Richter scale struck the Mariana Islands today. The epicenter was located 1,484 kilometers northeast of Davao, Philippines and 2,703 kilometers northeast of Lahad Datu, Sabah at a depth of 4.7 kilometers.The eathquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday). The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that there were no damages reported in the nation. Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no Tsunami indication.No tremors were felt in any of the major islands like Saipan nor in Hagåtña, the capital of Guam. An aftershock measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale hit the islands ten hours later but it did not trigger a tsunami.The US Geological Survey (USGS) on the afternoon of Easter Sunday monitored a large earthquake in the southern Imperial Valley south of Mexicali, Mexico near the Colorado River, at about 15:40 PDT (22:40 UTC). It was felt throughout the surrounding area for a great distance, with shaking said to have lasted for about a minute.The USGS reports that the epicenter was 26 kilometers (16 miles) south-southwest of Guadalupe Victoria, Baja California, Mexico, and 173 kilometers (108 miles) east-southeast of Tijuana, Baja California, at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).According to witnesses, the quake was felt as far away as Los Angeles and San Diego, California. The Reuters news agency reports numerous aftershocks, and the USGS has reported at least three at this time. One reached magnitude 5.1, another one, which occurred in the same place as the first quake, reached 5.4, and a third in Sonora reached 5.1.  A Wikinews correspondent in the Los Angeles area, Mike Morales, felt the earthquake and reports, "I was at home and then I almost thought it was vertigo, but really it was the earthquake. I'm surprised I could feel it here; it was in Baja California."One casualty has been reported in Mexicali, and the Los Angeles Fire Department has been put on alert. It was reported that a number of people were stuck in an elevator in Disneyland, Anaheim.There were about 30 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater in southern California and northern Baja California in the two hours immediately following the earthquake (see map below and right). Nine of them were of 4.0 or greater. A small number were in the immediate vicinity of the main earthquake. The majority of them were centered on an area about 40 miles to the northwest. The rest were scattered over a wide area of the southern California desert, as much as 100 miles from the main earthquake. Seismologists have not yet announced what relationship, if any, these earthquakes have to the main earthquake.According to the Chilean Oceanographic and Hydrographic Service (SHOA), no tsunamis are expected to reach the coast of Chile.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 7.4 earthquake has struck the Bonin Islands in Japan. Japanese officials have issued a tsunami warning for areas around the islands, including the southern half of the country. A number of aftershocks with magnitudes between five and six struck over the hour following the initial earthquake."Evacuate from the seashore immediately to the safe places near the above coasts," said the tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says there is no threat of a tsunami for Hawaii or the rest of the Pacific Ocean.The quake's epicenter was located approximately 155 kilometers (95 miles) east of Chichi-shima of the Bonin Islands. It occurred just after 3:15 a.m. local time and registered a depth of 14.9 k.m. (9.3 miles). The aftershock occurred just under 20 minutes later at 3:40 a.m. local time. It was located in the same area and registered a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).There is no word on damages at this time, but according to the USGS around 2,000 people may have felt the shaking. It also noted that, "the population in this region resides in structures that are resistant to earthquake shaking, though some vulnerable structures exist."Yesterday, at 10:39 p.m. UTC, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake rocked the Pacific Ocean about 180 miles southwest of Raoul Island, a member of the Kermadec Islands in New Zealand. Witnesses disagreed on the length of the earthquake, which was felt as far south as Christchurch, New Zealand, although they agreed the quake lasted from 30 seconds to a minute. Ever since the volcano eruption on Raoul Island on March 18, the islands have been experiencing about 30 earthquakes a day. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center predicted that the earthquake might create a small tsunami with a radius of about 60 miles. There have been no reported injuries or deaths.The tsunami occurred a couple of hours before a previously-scheduled test of a tsunami warning system. The test had 29 countries participating."It is a big earthquake, but the depth would limit any damage," Seismologist Ken Gledhill says.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a magnitude 7.9 earthquake has struck in the Pacific Ocean approximately 130 miles (209 km) south-southeast of Nuku'Alofa, Tonga, generating a tsunami.  It struck at 6:17 a.m. (local time) and was registered at a depth of only 6.2 miles (10km).The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) had earlier issued a tsunami warning for Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa, Samoa, Niue and the Kermadec Islands, which was later canceled.  The warning did not include Hawaii."Sea level readings confirm that a tsunami was generated. This tsunami may have been destructive along coastlines of the region near the earthquake epicenter," said the PTWC in a statement posted on their website. The size of the tsunami was not known.There were no reports of damage, injuries or deaths. According to the USGS, over 6,000 people live in the region hit by the quake. The USGS says damage could be minor in Havelu and 'Ohonua of Tonga, but residents are not concerned. One resident said that when morning arrived, people were "laughing" at the tsunami warning. No major waves were reported.On Wednesday, a volcano near the country's coastline began to erupt sending plumes of smoke and ash into the sky. The volcano is roughly 6 kilometers (4 mi) from the Tonga coast.A fuel tanker explosion in Nigeria killed at least seventy people on Saturday, officials have said.The incident took place in the southern state of Anambra. According to the authorities, the tanker flipped over after driving over a pothole, causing it to ignite. The fire quickly spread to five crowded minibuses nearby.The death toll is expected to increase as bodies continue to be recovered from the debris.The head of operations for Nigeria's Federal Road Safety Commission, Ben Ekenna, warned that similar such accidents will happen again if something is not done to improve the poorly-maintained Nigerian road network."If something isn't done quickly, tragedies like this will happen again," he said.On Monday local time, a chartered flight carrying 72 passengers and nine crew members crashed on the outskirts of the city of Medellín, Colombia. The Colombian police has indicated only five people on board survived the crash.The British Aerospace 146 was flying from Brazil to Colombia via Bolivia. The plane reported facing electrical problems near La Ceja and La Unión before crashing at roughly 10:15pm local time (0315 Tuesday UTC). The crash site had bad weather, and heavy fog prevented rescue helicopters from landing.According to initial reports, six passengers were rescued but later one of them died in hospital.The flight was carrying Brazilian Série A football team Chapecoense's delegations. Chapecoense was scheduled to play Colombian club Atlético Nacional today in the Copa Sudamericana final; Copa Sudamericana is South America's second-tier club competition, the winner of which is promoted to the first-tier competition of Copa Libertadores in the next season. The Chapecó based club were promoted to the first division Série A in 2014. They are currently ninth in the league table and the final league match of the season was scheduled to be played on Sunday against Atlético Mineiro. Reaching the final of Copa Sudamericana was the best outcome in the club's history.By varying reports either 21 or 22 Brazilian football journalists where also on the flight. The five survivors include at least two football players, who have been identified as Alan Ruschel and Jakson Follmann.South America's governing body of football CONMEBOL has suspended the upcoming fixture. Atlético Nacional were scheduled to play the second leg of the final on December 7.Brazilian president Michel Temer tweeted, "I express my solidarity at this sad time when dozens of Brazilian families have been affected by tragedy." ((pt))Portuguese language: ‍Nesta hora triste que a tragédia se abate sobre dezenas de famílias brasileiras, expresso minha solidariedade. Temer has also called three-day mourning in Brazil.Atlético Nacional requested CONMEBOL award the Copa Sudamericana to Chapecoense. Several Brazilian clubs said they would loan players to Chapecoense for the upcoming season for free. They also requested Chapecoense be granted three seasons' immunity from relegation to a lower division.The worst flooding in 27 years in Saudi Arabia has left at least 77 people dead, and dozens more could be missing. The floods came after torrential rains on Wednesday.The rainstorms mainly affected western parts of the country, including the cities of Jeddah, Rabigh and Mecca, and the surrounding area. Inclement weather hampered the start of the Muslim Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca; however, none of the dead people had been attending the event.The deaths were mainly caused by collapsed homes and high waters, according to officials. Witnesses say many of the casualties had been trapped in vehicles. Many cars had been swept away and city roads were flooded, blocking traffic.The Saudi Arabian Civil Defence Authority reported that emergency crews managed to rescue over 900 people.A train derailment at 20:41 local time (1841 UTC) yesterday just outside the city of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in north-western Spain has left at least 77 people dead and 131 injured, of which 20 are in a serious condition. Authorities have not yet definitively given a cause for the crash but are currently treating it as likely to be an accident.The train was going from Madrid to the coastal city of Ferrol. Reports indicate the train was travelling at an excessive speed — 180 kilometers an hour, more than twice the recommended speed of 80 kilometers an hour. RENFE, the train company, have said the train was running five minutes late.Ricardo Montero, a man who was on the train, told radio station Cadena SER: "A lot of people were squashed on the bottom. We tried to squeeze out of the bottom of the wagons to get out and we realised the train was burning [...] I was in the second wagon and there was fire. [...] I saw corpses."The crash occurred a day before a festival in Santiago was due to start, which has now been cancelled. The Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy made a statement: "In the face of a tragedy such as just happened in Santiago de Compostela on the eve of its big day, I can only express my deepest sympathy as a Spaniard and a Galician." Rajoy is to visit the site of the accident today.A deadly road crash in New Brunswick, Canada has claimed the lives of eight people near the city of Bathurst on Saturday. A van carrying 12 people was returning from a school basketball game in Moncton when it slid on an icy highway and collided with a semi-trailer truck.Of the dead, seven were members of the Bathurst High School boys basketball team and the other was a teacher, the van driver's wife. The survivors are three teammates and a coach who was driving the van, all of whom were hospitalised at Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. The driver of the semi-trailer was uninjured. The crash occurred on New Brunswick Route 8 as it approached the junction with Route 11 into Bathurst.Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper expressed his shock and condolences, describing the tragedy as "unthinkable". New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham also expressed his condolences.An earthquake with estimated magnitude 8.0 (later, revised to 7.9 by USGS) shook the Pacific island of Tonga. The strongest quake of the year so far, the earthquake occurred at 04:26 local time (15:27 UTC) on May 3 at 19.9°S, 174.2°W, about 150 KM south of Neiafu, Tonga and 2150 KM north-northeast of Auckland, New Zealand. Three more earthquakes with moderate magnitude of 5.1 (1700 UTC, 06:00 local time), 5.4 (1756 UTC, 06:56 local time) and 5.1 (1928 UTC, 8:28 local time) were felt in the same region, according to USGS report.  The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu issued tsunami warnings for Fiji and New Zealand and a tsunami watch for other areas in the Pacific, including Hawaii, but excluding the west coast of North America. The warning and watches were cancelled at 1736 UTC (7:36 a.m. HST).According to the latest bulletin, sea level readings indicated a tsunami was generated. There was some definite tsunami activity recorded near Pago Pago and Niue.No major damage or injuries have been reported in Tonga, but power was temporarily lost, which reportedly prevented Tongan authorities from receiving the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC.Fourteen schools in Hawaii located on or near coastlines were closed all of Wednesday despite the warnings being lifted.An 8.8 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Chile on Saturday, killing at least 214 people and causing significant structural damage. The earthquake was felt in Chillan, Talca, Concepcion, and the capital Santiago. Sea level recording triggered tsunami warnings for Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. The earthquake, which started at 06.34.14 UTC, was felt as far as Argentina. This earthquake occurred at the boundary between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates. The two plates are converging at a rate of 80 millimeters per year. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has announced that a tsunami warning is in effect for much of the Pacific Rim, including parts of Oceania and Central America.According to the BBC, "large waves" have struck Chile's Juan Fernández Islands, reaching halfway into one inhabited area. Three people are missing local media says. Reuters reported the Tsunami hit Tahiti at 16.50 UTC, where the BBC reports that the first waves were "smaller," measuring only 36 centimeters.According to the AFP, part of the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia was hit by a 13 foot wave. No casualties have been reported. The New Zealand Herald reported New Zealand evacuated coastal areas at 8:00 AM local time (18.00 UTC). Waves of 20 centimeters or less were reported at the Chatham Islands (400 miles from the New Zealand mainland) at 19.05 UTC. The Ministry of Civil Defense told the BBC that "the greatest wave heights will occur between six and 12 hours after the initial arrivals."Coastal waters in Hilo, Hawaii were reported as "visibly receding" at 11:30 AM local time (21.30 UTC) by Hawaii News Now.According to MSNBC, a 5 1/2 foot wave reportedly made land fall on Hilo Bay, Hawaii a short while after 12:00 P.M. local time (22.00 UTC).A massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern Japan early on Friday.  The earthquake's epicenter is 130 km (81 miles) east of Sendai, in the Honshu island of Japan. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was at a depth of 24.4 km (15.2 miles).The earthquake triggered tsunamis in various parts of the country. Japan issued a tsunami warning immediately after the earthquake, followed by tsunami warnings for New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Chile, Guam, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Hawaii, Northern Marianas (USA), Taiwan, and California. It is confirmed for the Philippines that if the tsunami doesn't hit the country for 2 hours (5:00 - 7:00) it will be slightly safer, it is currently alert number two for all regions.The tsunami attained a height of 10 meters, and swept houses, buildings and cars according to reports. Shinkansen stopped the bullet train service following the quake. According to reports, an oil refinery was set ablaze by the quake at Ichihara, Chiba prefecture to the east of Tokyo.The National Weather Service said that earthquakes "of this size" often "generate tsunamis potentially dangerous to coasts outside the source region." "Based on all available data a tsunami may have been generated by this earthquake that could be destructive on coastal areas even far from the epicenter," it added.About 20 people were reportedly injured in Tokyo following the collapse of a roof of a hall. 4 million people are estimated to be without power in the capital. In Sendai, several people are feared to be buried under the remains of a collapsed hotel.Prime Minister Naoto Kan said there had been no nuclear plant radiation leaks caused by the disaster. He expressed sympathy to all victims in his address, promising help, and stating that an emergency response headquarters had been set up. 288 people have been confirmed dead so far.However, a 2-3 km area around the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant has been evacuated as a precaution as the temperature inside on of the nuclear reactor has "remain[ed] at a high temperature" despite the plant being shut down. Trade Minister Banri Kaieda advised that there is a possibility of a radiation leak at the plant.A minimum of 85 Hindu pilgrims have been killed in India and 64 injured after their lorry and trailer plunged 24m (80ft) into a river gorge late last night.Approximately 150 people were on board when the driver lost control on a sharp bend near the village of Nagbavji, Rajasthan, smashing through a concrete crash barrier and continuing down into the valley, coming to rest inverted. An overnight rescue operation was initiated, removing both survivors and bodies of the dead from the wreck, with the aid of cranes and spotlights. Ambulances and medical teams rushed to the scene from surrounding areas. Of the 64 who were hospitalised, three are reported to be in critical condition. The Press Trust of India reported that as many as 130 were injured, and Al Jazeera reported that there may have been 200 people on board. It is believed the death toll could rise still further, as many people remain trapped beneath the trailer.The truck was a 12-wheeled model designed for hauling shipping containers, and was carrying pilgrims from three nearby villages Shiwal, Madri and Bhawa. The driver had offered to take them to their destination for free, a practise common in India, despite the fact that such trucks are not safe for passenger transport, being designed primarily as freight transporters.The vehicle had been destined for the temple of Ramdev, a site considered by both Hindus and Muslims as being of high spiritual significance. The temple is the subject of an annual ten-day pilgrimage every September, which begins on September 13, although most of the 250,000 pilgrims who flock to the site arrive several days in advance of the festival.The Chief Minister of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje visited the three villages in which the victims resided. The local government has initiated a full inquiry into the disaster.BBC News is now reporting that at least 83 people were rescued after a massive landslide buried three villages in Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte province, in central Philippines, Friday. So far, 19 people have been confirmed dead. Up to 1,500 are thought to still be missing. The Red Cross has despatched a plane with rescuers and basic equipment; they have also appealed for US$1.5 million for relief supplies for the affected area. It is believed that the slides were triggered by heavy rains of up to 200cm (79 inches) in just 10 days and an earthquake of magnitude 2.6. Some residents had already left the area previous to the disaster fearing landslides but had returned following easing of the rain.Houses and an elementary school packed with children were buried, officials and witnesses said. Photographs and footage show only coconut trees and a few tin roofs sticking out of the soil after part of a mountainside collapsed on the farming village of Guinsaugon in Southern Leyte province.Rescue efforts are being hampered due to continual rock falls, washed out bridges, chest deep mud and a lack of heavy equipment. "Rescuers are scared because they can still hear the mountain rumbling," said Maria Lim, the mayor of Saint Bernard, where a minor earthquake was felt on Friday morning. President Gloria Arroyo has ordered the navy and the coast to the area to assist with relief efforts when conditions improve. Two US vessels are also on their way to help.A semi-tractor carrying 9,000 gallons (34,000 litres) of liquid butane overturned at the weekend on the United States highway 50 east of Salida, Colorado, rupturing the tank and spilling its contents. The road was closed to traffic for 20 hours during one of the busiest times of the year, and traffic rerouted along a three-hour diversion route.Colorado State Patrol reports state the driver, Roger Meely, 62, was hauling a pressurised tank full of butane when he lost control and crashed near Mile Marker 228. Colorado State Patrol Sgt. William Holt described the accident, “He lost control of the vehicle in the curves, veered across the lanes and rolled it." Meely was treated and released from the Heart of the Rockies hospital in Salida after the crash, but escaped serious injury.The truck rolled at about 6:50 p.m. six miles from Salida, prompting closure of the highway. Although the driver escaped unharmed, 10-15 homes and an unknown number of campsites along the Arkansas River were evacuated as fumes began to drift downstream towards the town of Swissvale. Rafters were ordered away from the area, but Hazmat crews were able to prevent butane from contaminating the river.Emergency workers were forced to allow the butane to vent itself through the night. Capt. Jack Cowert of the Colorado State Patrol said, "I would say those of us on scene were surprised it didn't explode."In total, the following organisations responded: the Colorado State Patrol Hazardous Materials Unit, South Arkansas Fire Protection District, Howard Volunteer Fire Department, Arkansas Valley Ambulance, Chaffee County Emergency Services, Alpine Towing and the Colorado Department of Transportation.An attempt was made at 9:00 a.m. Monday to right the tanker and tow it away, but in the process of securing it to the tow truck it slipped and a dolly axle buckled, further lengthening the delay.The road was not reopened until 3:10 p.m. Monday. Sheila Johnson, a flagger working for Alpine Towing, later said of the commuters affected that they were mostly understanding, saying of them, "For the most part people were pretty good about the road being closed,".Holt blamed the driver for the accident, saying he “will be cited for something,” and that “anytime a crash like this happens, the driver either wasn’t paying attention or he was driving too fast.” It was later determined that the driver's excessive speed was to blame. He was ultimately charged over the incident.The incident sparked a full review evaluating the emergency response, which included about ten agencies.Marvin Schur, a 93-year-old man from Bay City, Michigan has died after the electric company limited his electric use due to his failure to pay over US$1,000 in past-due payments.Bay City Electric Light & Power installed a power-limiting device on his home on January 13. The device would limit the amount of power the resident uses and would essentially shut it off if that limit is reached, or if the resident fails to pay the outstanding bill within 10 days of installation. In order for the electricity to be turned back on, the limiter must be reset by pushing a button.Bay City power says that a warning, indicating that the power was to be turned off and a limiter installed, had been placed on Schur's front door. Despite that, the company says that they are now "looking at our website and possibly doing an automated phone message. We obviously need to get the word out."The autopsy performed on Schur's body concluded that he had died "a slow, painful death" caused by hypothermia. Dr. Kanu Virani, who performed the autopsy, explained: "Hypothermia shuts the whole system down, slowly. It's not easy to die from hypothermia without first realizing your fingers and toes feel like they're burning."It was less than 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 Centigrade) in Schur's home when neighbors found Schur dead on January 17. Virani commented that it was his first time performing an autopsy on a body in which "the person froze to death indoors.""His furnace was not running - the insides of his windows were full of ice the morning we found him," said George A. Pauwels Jr., who was with his wife when they found Schur's body.In Michigan it is illegal for a utility company to disconnect power to any home between November 1 and March 31 when a resident is over the age of 65. Limiters are also not supposed to be used during that time frame. However, municipally-owned electric utilities like the one in Bay City, are not regulated by the state. The Michigan state attorney general's office has launched an investigation into the incident.Residents around Schur's home say he was hard of hearing, and the city states that the device's function and operation were never explained to him. When word of the story got around, people from all over the United States began to call the city in anger."I've taken calls from Canada, Massachusetts, Texas, New York, Alabama - and that's just the ones I can think of off the top of my head," said Melody Roth of the city's administrative office, who also added that people from all over are "calling all city departments, not just our office."Schur has no known children, and his wife had died several years prior to the incident.A moderate earthquake shook western Montana at 10:08 p.m. on Monday. No immediate reports of damage have been received by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and its National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquake was centered about 20 km (15 miles) north-northeast of Dillon, and about 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.One of the world's most advanced earthquake warning systems in Japan has been found to have some practical use problems. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) apologized on Tuesday for erroneously issuing an "earthquake early warning for advanced users", with regards to an earthquake which occurred on the Monday night at sea off Ibaraki Prefecture, eastern Japan. There was, in fact, no possibility of huge tremors. The root cause was a simple human mistake that happened while setting a single seismograph with a criterion. The accidental release of the warning also revealed that some receiver devices could not handle warnings properly under certain conditions.JMA operates a system called "Earthquake Early Warning" (EEW). It is designed to analyze seismic waves as soon as possible after an earthquake is detected, and issue a warning if large tremors are expected to happen. Its purpose is to minimize the damage caused by seismic tremors. Two EEW schemes were put into practical use in 2006 and 2007.The warning was released by the EEW scheme for advanced users such as railway operators, workers in factories, managers at some offices and schools, and some local cable TV broadcasters. Another EEW scheme for the general public, which is utilized by nationwide broadcasting networks such as NHK, was not involved in this incident. All four subway lines operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau were suspended in response to the first false warning, even though it was corrected within 11 seconds. At a private railway company, an EEW receiving system crashed, apparently because of the wrong data. East Japan Railway Company, which has its own earthquake observation network, judged the warning to be an error and didn't take a real reaction in its railway operation. In addition to troubling railway companies, the warning also caused confusion among people. Some commercially-sold receiver devices failed to handle the warning appropriately. Some of them, adapted by an information distributor company for its service, displayed an incredible magnitude of 12.7, while the warning didn't include a datum of the JMA magnitude. One device at a junior high school boarding house in Aichi Prefecture called an alert as if the seismic intensity could have reached to the Scale 6 Lower (the third highest of 10 JMA scales), causing some girl students to cry. The device didn't say that the students were far away from the focus.Such failures show that recipients of an "EEW for advanced users" are not always trained well enough to react appropriately. Ironically, in the JMA building a similar case was also confirmed. A receiver device displayed a Scale 7 alert, the highest of JMA scales.According to JMA's announcement on the same night and news conference on the following morning, one seismograph was incorrectly set with the criterion of acceleration at 10 gals. (Correctly the criterion is at 100 gals.) This mistake resulted in the first (false) warning, which was soon corrected by the second warning. The JMA confessed that the seismograph has not undergone a check since it was installed in December, 2003. The EEW scheme for advanced users is designed to put priority on calling alerts, so it releases a warning even if data from only one observation point is known. The same simple human mistakes were not committed at other points, according to JMA. In the parallel EEW scheme for the general public, the same mistake would not cause the same error, because it releases a warning based on data from multiple observation points, not depending on the criterion of acceleration.At the Sellafield reprocessing plant, a leak in the process was spotted on April 19. The leak did not cause danger to people or the environment but it disturbed the normal operation of the plant.Workers at the plant noticed a discrepancy in the amount of material being reprocessed that enters pipes that lead to a set of centrifuges and the amount of material actually arriving at the centrifuges.  They used remote cameras to find the crack where the material was escaping; over twenty tonnes have leaked into a steel lined chamber.The material, consisting of mostly uranium and some plutonium dissolved in nitric acid, would have been reprocessed in the centrifuges. The large stainless steel chamber that now contains the spilled material is too dangerous to enter due to radioactivity, though it poses no danger to those inside or outside the plant.The plant has been shut down pending repairs.On Monday, an Air France Airbus A380, operating as Air France Flight 007, collided with a Comair Bombardier CRJ-700, operating as Comair flight 553/Delta Connection flight 6293 in Delta Connection livery, on a taxiway at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. The A380 had 520 people onboard, and the smaller plane had 66.The Comair jet had just arrived from Boston Logan International Airport, and was stopped on the tarmac, awaiting a gate to offload passengers. The A380 was preparing to depart for Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, and was taxiing along a taxiway when its wingtip struck the tail of the other plane. The impact spun the CRJ around 90 degrees and resulted in some damage to both planes.A passenger on board the A380 said that "It really felt just like a speedbump or like hitting a pothole—a jolt—but it didn't feel right [it felt] like that shouldn't be happening."LiveATC.net captured the recording of the flight deck and ground control communications before and after the incident. In the recording, one can hear controllers giving taxi instructions to the Air France plane, then later a controller calling for emergency personnel to the intersection of taxiways Alpha and Mike.The National Transportation Safety Board plans to investigate the incident, and will study the flight recorders, air traffic control recordings, and data from radar on the ground.Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi was revealed today to have requested his second appeal to be dropped. Al-Megrahi was convicted of planting a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103, which detonated as the aircraft flew over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 killing all 259 people on board and eleven more on the ground.Megrahi had been offered transfer to his home of Libya if he dropped the appeal, but had previously stated he would not return unless his conviction was overturned. He has terminal prostate cancer and it is thought that he is due to be released shortly on compassionate grounds, having served eight years of his minimum term of 27 years in Greenock prison.Megrahi lost his first appeal in 2002, but a review found that there was reason to believe there may have been a miscarriage of justice. The decision to drop his second appeal comes as a surprise, with some victims' relatives expecting the proceedings to continue even after his death. A court hearing to consider the request is due on Tuesday.Opinions about the conviction are split, with the families of most British victims considering the man to be innocent while those in the United States are satisfied with his guilt. Briton Martin Cadman, whose son Bill was among the dead, told The Daily Telegraph "It's been nearly 21 years since the event and where are we? Nowhere." Last year, on the twentieth anniversary of the disaster the head of the US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, Kara Weipz, told Wikinews that "There is no difference between the truth as we see it and the official version of events. The facts are the facts, Mr. Megrahi is guilty."In a televised statement on Monday, Thailand's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva blamed the loss of life last Saturday in Bangkok on armed terrorists who had infiltrated the Red Shirt protesters. He added that the security forces had opened fire only when fired upon.The Prime Minister's statement came as he was suffering a double blow to his authority. As coffins draped in Thai flags paraded through Bangkok to symbolise the death of democracy, Thailand's electoral commission ruled that Vejjajiva's Democrat Party should disband. In addition, the chief of the Thai Army, General Anupong Paojinda, publicly called for the dissolution of parliament.Despite pressure from the Vejjajiva administration, the Thai Army, which traditionally has been politically significant in the country, has been reluctant to use force against the protesters, and will become even more so following what will be seen as innocent blood on its hands. Even though Vejjajiva has stated that the government and military remain united, without the unequivocal support of the Thai military and security forces, his administration has very little room for maneuver.Ironically, Vejjajiva may be saved from having to concede to the Red Shirts' demands for fresh elections through the same process that deposed his predecessor and led to his own rise to the premiership. A court has ruled that Vejjajiva's Democrat Party accepted 258 million baht in illegal campaign donations from cement maker TPI Polene. Under Thai law, the courts have the power to dissolve any party ruled to have broken electoral laws and to ban its members from public office for five years. This is the same law that in 2008 resulted in the disbanding of the People's Power Party and the removal of Somchai Wongsawat from office. Leaders from both sides of the political divide have welcomed this development as a way to resolve the current deadlock.However political commentators note that even with fresh elections the impasse that led to what is now known as Black Saturday would not end. Thai society has become increasingly polarised into pro-Thaksin Shinawatra and anti-Thaksin Shinawatra camps, and neither side will be willing to see the other side in power whatever the results of elections. The violence on April 10, 2010, the worst for 20 years, saw the death of 21 people, four soldiers and sixteen civilians, including Reuters reporter Hiroyuki Muramoto.File:Phoenix aerial Arizona USA1.jpgThe 29-year-old father of a 5-year-old Phoenix, Arizona girl is being accused of regularly beating his daughter over the past few months.KPHO-TV reported that Ezra Hazell abused the girl because she did not do her homework.Hazell was charged on Tuesday on five counts of child abuse.The girl's 25-year-old stepmother, Kristie Hazell, was also charged with two accounts of child abuse.Police report that wounds across the girl's back, buttocks, legs, arms and chest total 100.Police said that Hazell would order the girl to go into a push-up position, before beating her with a nylon military belt or a computer cord.

The actor, who is aged 25 and plays the character of Jason Grimshaw in ITV soap-opera Coronation Street, was believed to be involved in a collision involving his Chrysler striking a lamppost.  This occurred at around 0400 GMT on October 31 in the city centre of Manchester.It has been reported that Ryan has been taken away for questioning by the police. Another man was also arrested in connection with this incident, and was later charged with the offence of driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to recent reports. Thomas was however not charged with offences relating to the accident.A spokesperson for the Greater Manchester Police has said the following about this incident: "Police were called following a report of a collision. Officers attended and found a Chrysler had collided with a lamp-post. A 25-year-old was interviewed by police on Friday 6 November 2009."Indonesian budget airline Adam Air has been given a three-week ultimatum by the authorities to prove its economic stability or its license will be revoked, said Transportation Minister Jusman Djamal. This is because major financial difficulties have become apparent today, with two major shareholders pulling out of the company.PT Global Transport Service (GTS) and Bright Star Perkasa, who between them own a 50% stake in the company, have decided to sell back all their shares to their original owners, who control the other 50%. These are the family of founder Adam Suherman and Sandra Ang. The companies invested in the airline last year, when the company was struggling after the New Year's Day disappearance of Adam Air Flight 574 with 102 on board. The Boeing 737 (B737) was ultimately determined to have crashed into the sea near Sulawesi, and all on board are presumed dead. Shortly afterwards, Adam Air Flight 172, another B737, snapped in half during a hard landing, but held together preventing fatalities. These were not the first serious accidents for the company, as in February 2006 Flight 782 became lost for several hours after navigation systems failed and the plane entered a radar blackspot, forcing a subsequent emergency landing many miles from the intended route. The given reasons for the withdrawal are a lack of improvement in safety and financial irregularities.The company has now also defaulted on debt payments to aircraft lease firms, resulting in 12 of their 22 planes being seized, and has cut the number of routes served from 52 to 12. The remaining ten planes are also in default and at risk of seizure. Adam Air owes leasing companies US$14 million compared to free capital of $4.8 million of free capital. They have agreed to buy back shares gradually for $11 million (100 billion rupiah), $6 million less than the investment firms paid for them. The cost difference will be borne by Harry Tanoesoedibyo's family, the founder of PT Bhakti Investama, of which GTS is a wholly owned subsidiary. The companies have also lost 157 billion rupiah worth of investment in the company since the April 2007 deal. 9,325 Rupiah are currently worth US$1.GTS director Gustiono Kustianto said that "Since we joined, our priority has been safety" but that Adam Air's management had been unresponsive to pressure from the new investors to improve its poor record. Last weeek another company B737 shot off the runway during landing, damaging the plane and injuring five.Lawyer Marx Andryan of Hotman Paris Hutapea, representing the investment firms, said they have documents proving the company has not adequatly seen to pilot recruitment, maintenance and insurance.Suherman said "We have defaulted and the investors have done nothing about it. We'll continue to operate as long as we have planes," adding that there are no current plans to declare bankruptcy."Out of 22 planes, now we only have 10 because 12 of them have been declared in default. The other 10 have been declared in default as well, but I'm still trying to work out a way to restructure the payments," he told Reuters. He went on to say that a cash injection is required, and that "There is a possibility starting on March 21 Adam Air will temporarily cease operations until there is a decision from the shareholders regarding the insurance premium."Indonesian budget carrier Adam Air has been warned by Indonesia's transport minister that unless the airline improves safety it will be shut down. Adam Air has suffered a string of recent accidents."We are giving them a chance to improve. If there's no change, we will place them in the third category," said Transport Minister Jusman Syafii Djamal, according to the state's Antara news agency. The third category refers to the lowest a three-category ratings system for airline safety introduced last year. Airlines in the third category will be shut down in three months unless improvements occur. Adam Air is in the second category, which means that although the airline meets minimum requirements some problems still remain. "We give an early warning to make the carrier improve its safety," Djamal told reporters.The announcement follows the news yesterday that an Adam Air Boeing 737-400 had overshot the runway at Batam island's airport, injuring five of the over 170 people on board. It is the third serious accident in just over a year. On New Year's Day 2007 Adam Air Flight 574 crashed into the ocean near Sulawesi, leaving 102 missing, presumed dead. The following month Flight 172 cracked in half after a hard landing but held together, preventing fatalities. Both aircraft were Boeing 737s.Danke Drajat, spokesman for Adam Air, said that the airline was making efforts to comply with the demand. "We are completing all manuals and revamping the standard operating procedure," he said.The Adam Air accidents accounted for two of the three main accidents that caused the European Union to ban Indonesian airlines from EU airspace last year over safety standards. The other, Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, involved a 737 belonging to the state owned flag carrier speeding off a runway at Yogyakarta during an attempted landing; 21 people were killed.Indonesia budget airline Adam Air has reached an agreement with United States marine salvage firm Phoenix International to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder (or "black boxes") from Adam Air Flight 574, a Boeing 737 aircraft that crashed into the sea on New Year's Day near Sulawesi, Indonesia during a scheduled domestic passenger flight, killing all 102 on board.According to Adam Air chairman Adam Suherman the salvage operation will be conducted in July.Previous disputes had left doubts over whether the devices would be retrieved at all, with both the government and Adam Air placing responsibility for funding the operation on each other. Indonesia does not have the equipment or the funds to conduct the operation itself, and had originally asked Japan, France and the US for help. They eventually announced that they would not pay for the operation, neither could they force Adam Air to.However, Adam Air took it upon themselves to retrieve the recorders, culminating in this agreement with Phoenix. The lack of either recorder has thus far made determining the cause of the disaster extremely difficult.The passenger numbers for Indonesian budget airline Adam Air have increased dramatically, following a slump after the loss of Adam Air Flight 574 on New Year's Day.Adam Air usually carries 450,000 - 600,000 passengers a month, but lost about 30 percent of those immediately following the crash. Adam Air corporate communications head Danke Dradjat explained the situation during a telephone conversation with reporters from The Jakarta Post. "There was a slowdown in the month following the crash, but it was brief and we managed to get back our passengers over the following three months, with a gradual increase of ten percent per month... There wasn't any special campaign to get the passengers back. We only emphasized the fact that our aircraft were maintained and serviced by the same technicians as Garuda Indonesia," he said. Garuda is Indonesia's state-owned airline.Adam Air currently operates services to as many as 150 destinations every day, including international services to Singapore and Malaysia. Danke, who defended Adam Air by pointing out that major airlines also suffer accidents, said he expects passenger numbers to continue increasing. "We're expecting up to a 30 percent increase in passengers in the seven days before and after the Idul Fitri festivities." According to Danke, Idul Fitri is one of three periods over which passenger numbers hit peak levels, the others being Christmas and New Year.Kolontar, Hungary is currently being evacuated as new damage was discovered at the burst reservoir that spilled hazardous sludge on Monday 04 October 2010 in Western Hungary. If the embankment dam of the storage pond that already released about 700,000 cubic meters of highly alkaline (pH ~13) red sludge into the area would entirely collapse, an extra volume of 500,000 cubic meters of red mud could be released. A second spill containing more sediments from the bottom of the reservoir would be heavier and thicker than the first one, and would move less rapidly. The flash flood of Monday already killed seven people, chemically burnt 150 others, and left the land and the surface water devastated by the sodium hydroxide and the iron oxides bearing also traces of heavy metals. According to Reuters the prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, arrived in the village Saturday morning. It is also being reported that the newly discovered damage is minor; however, disaster crews do not want to take any chances and are evacuating the village's 800 inhabitants as a precaution. The evacuees are being taken to a sports hall and two high schools, which are eight kilometers away from the reservoir in a town called Ajka.Hurricane Adrian appears to be dissipating over Honduras, but is still providing heavy rainfall to the region.  At 8 a.m. PDT, the center of now Tropical Depression Adrian was dissipating at 15.0° N, 87.5°W and was inland over western Honduras.  It is moving toward the northeast at about 17 mph (28 km/h) with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 km/h).The Salvadoran Comité de Emergencia Nacional (National Emergency Committee) reported that over 15,400 people were evacuated from high risk areas.Tropical Depression Adrian is expected to produce an additional 4 to 6 inches of rainfall over Honduras over the next 24 hours, and mudslides are a major fear for residents.  The National Hurricane Center has discontinued its public advisories for Adrian unless the storm regenerates.Adventurer Steve Fossett has gone missing over western Nevada. He took off in a single engine plane Monday morning, planning to return around noon, and has not been seen since. Reports say that Fossett was flying to look for a suitable site for his planned land speed record attempt.Fossett took off in a single-engine Bellanca Super Decathlon at around 9 a.m. local time Monday (16:00 UTC) and was to return around noon. When he failed to return, his family alerted the authorities, and a search was started about 6 p.m. local time (01:00 UTC Tuesday), involving the Nevada and California Highway Patrols and the Nevada Air National Guard. Fossett only had enough fuel for five hours of flight, at the most, but was also carrying a cellphone and communication equipment in his aircraft.The search has been impeded by high winds and the fact that rescuers have no idea where Fossett's destination is, since no flight plan was logged prior to takeoff. The search area is estimated to be around 600 square miles (the size of Greater London), which may take up to a week to scour.Fossett is most famous for gliding around the world in a hot-air balloon in 2002, becoming the first person to fly a balloon solo around the world.  He also became the first person to fly around the world without stopping in 2005.In a statement to the press, his former crewmate and rival, Sir Richard Branson remained confident he will be found: "Steve is a tough old boot. I suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up."On Monday, September 4th, the Civil Air Patrol opened a mission base in Nevada to support search and rescue operations for Fossett. At 5:30 a.m. PDT on September 6th, the Civil Air Patrol opened a second mission base at Bishop, California. Twelve aircrews and numerous base personnel arrived on scene on September 5th to be able to start launching aircraft early on the morning of the 6th.Base staff spent the evening and night analyzing what little radar and intelligence information is available, to plan the areas to be searched this morning. Crews will be assigned a search area (or grid) upon arrival at the base, receive a briefing, plan the search area coverage and launch. After they complete each grid, the crews return to the base, document the mission, and are debriefed. They then may have a short break, and start the assignment process again.An aerial collision near Zell am See, Austria has killed 8 people, 5 Swiss citizens, 1 French, 1 German and 1 Austrian.The collision occurred Monday afternoon between a Super Puma helicopter belonging to Helog S.A, based in Küssnacht (Switzerland), and a private Diamond DA20 "Katana" light aircraft which had taken off from the aerodrome at Zell am See.All 7 of the passengers and crew from the helicopter were pronounced dead at the scene, as was the pilot of the light aircraft, which had no passengers on board.The debris from the accident spread over a 20 metre radius and bystanders near to the incident reported seeing a "huge ball of fire in the sky".The reason for the accident is presently unclear as both craft have been confirmed as passing pre-flight testing at their respective take-off locations. Furthermore, Zell am See tower radioed the helicopter that a plane was taking off, to which the helicopter replied positively. This conversation should have been heard over radio by the pilot of the plane.The site of the accident is now being guarded by police, pending the arrival of an investigation team and a delegate of the state attorney.Aerosmith have cancelled their remaining concerts on their tour. The rock band was due to tour the United States and Canada until September 16. They have cancelled the tour after lead singer Steven Tyler was injured after he fell off stage while performing on August 5. Tyler suffered a broken shoulder and injuries to the head as the band played in front of a crowd in South Dakota. He was airlifted to hospital after the fall, and later travelled to Boston to see his own doctor. Doctors advised him to recuperate as he rests his shoulder. The group made the announcement saying they had “great regret” for cancelling the tour. Guitarist Joe Perry said "words can't express the sadness I feel for having to cancel this tour," while guitarist Brad Whitford wished Tyler a “speedy recovery”. The injured Tyler released a statement, saying “I'm plain grateful that I didn't break my neck” and thanked the police and medical staff for their help.The blast of an improvised explosive device (IED) in Kandahar, Afghanistan killed four Canadian soldiers and one journalist, while also injuring a civilian and four other soldiers.The group was travelling as part of a provincial reconstruction team when the attack, which took place at 4PM local time, when the armoured vehicle they were travelling in struck the IED approximately 1,500 metres from the Dand district centre, which Canadians had helped rebuild after a suicide attack in April.  This attack comes on the same day as an attack that killed eight US civilians and one week after the death of Lieutenant Andrew Nuttall.  The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack.Brigadier General Daniel Ménard has stated Dand continues to be a "safe area" and stated confidence the attack was an isolated incident.Those injured in the attack were moved to the field hospital at Kandahar Airfield and are expected to survive.  No further details on the injured, including their names and conditions are expected to be released.The deceased soldiers were identified as Sergeant George Miok, Sergeant Kirk Taylor, Corporal Zackery McCormack and Private Garrett Chidley.  The journalist was identified as Michelle Lang, 34, of Calgary, a reporter with the Calgary Herald, on secondment to the Canwest News Service for a six week tour with the Canadian Forces in Kandahar.  The US Ambassador to Canada, as well as Governor General Michaelle Jean have issued statements expressing condolences for those lost in the incident.To date, 138 soldiers and four civilians have died in the war-torn country. Lang is the first Canadian journalist to die in the conflict, with seven journalists from other countries also having died.Afghan police have said that a member of parliament (MP) escaped an assassination attempt on Friday night near the capital of Kabul. Five bodyguards, however, died.An Afghan district police chief told the Voice of America news agency that a remote-controlled bomb targeted the convoy of Abdul Rab Rasoul Sayyaf as it moved along roads outside the capital. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack.Sayyaf is an MP from the Kabul province, and a former warlord. This was not the first attempt on his life; he has survived at least one other similar attack.Sayyaf was one of the ex-mujahideen leaders who fought against the Taliban in the mid-1990s.  He became a strong supporter of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government and the international forces after the United States-led invasion in 2001. The Human Rights Watch, however, has accused him of war crimes.Afghan officials said more than twenty people have been wounded today in a suicide car bomb attack on a convoy of vehicles near Camp Phoenix, a US-runNATO military base in the capital of Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing.NATO said nine of its soldiers and ten civilian contractors were among those wounded. It added that the rest of the casualties were bystanders, including several Afghans.  According to NATO spokesman Kevin Bell, the attack happened at just before 08.00 local time, close to a checkpoint at the base. Camp Phoenix houses US soldiers that help train Afghan security forces.Several attacks have targeted international operations in the Afghan capital, Kabul, in recent months, including attacks on a UN guesthouse and the Indian embassy.This year has been the deadliest for international troops in Afghanistan since the fall of the government in 2001.A suicide bomber attacked an American base in the Khowst region on the Pakistani border of Afghanistan, leaving seven American CIA officers dead and six injured. No American or NATO military personnel were killed or injured in the attack on Forward Operating Base Chapman.It appears that the suicide bomber, reportedly wearing an Afghan National Army uniform, blew himself up in either the gym or the dining facility of Base Chapman.In a statement on the Voice of Jihad web page, the Taliban claimed responsiblity for the attack, alleging 20 "CIA employees" were killed in the incident.The Chapman Base is a converted military base which is now being used for civilian reconstruction operations, although military personnel are still located on the base. Camp Salerno, the main base in the Khowst province, has been the target of many attacks in recent weeks.Recent attacks have been focused on foreign civilians, such as an incident in October in which 7 foreign and 3 Afghan civilians were killed in an attack at a UN guest house. The CIA has not lost this many operatives in nearly 25 years and the last time CIA agents were killed was in 2003.A car bomb attack this morning, which targeted a NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, has killed or wounded dozens of people. The death toll was not confirmed, and estimates range from ten to twenty deaths. 47 people were injured in the attack.The incident occurred at the Darulaman crossroads, near a US-Afghan military base and the parliament. Six NATO troops died in the attack alongside several civilians. The NATO said they had sealed off the region. The bomber had been driving a car filled with explosives, which they detonated at around  0815 local time [0415 GMT].Iain Baxter, a spokesman for Isaf (International Security Assistance Force), stated: "An Isaf convoy was hit. At the moment we're trying to confirm the number of Isaf casualties." He could not confirm the number of Isaf personnel killed in the attack.Zemarai Bashary, an Interior Ministry spokesperson, confirmed the attack, noting that "[t]here are a number of casualties, civilians killed and wounded." The death toll is unclear, and we're checking all the hospitals," he added.Hamid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, said it was a "heartbreaking" attack. "We are condemning the attack in the strongest terms. I hope Afghanistan will soon get out of this suffering, God willing," he commented on national television.General Ahmad Zia Yaftali, the chief military doctor of the Afghan army, claimed twenty people had been killed. "We have five bodies brought to our hospital so far [...] the number of the dead is more than 20," Yaftali told Agence France-Presse news agency.Later, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying a resident of Kabul, Nizamuddin, had been sent to "destroy five foreign vehicles and damage one more." "Today's attack was part of the Al Fatah operation and we will continue attacking foreigners and government security forces and their associates," Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesperson said. The latter had 1,500 pounds of explosives in his Toyota van. NATO officials said five US military convoys were destroyed along with a further thirteen public vehicles. One of the vehicles to be destroyed was a bus filled with people.Riots were ignited in Afghanistan yesterday, after a crash involving a U.S. sports utility vehicle claimed the lives of several Afghan civilians.Details surrounding the crash, in Kabul, are still unclear, although Afghanis who saw the crash blame U.S. forces for the incident.  "The civilian vehicle was trying to get into the main road when the two foreign vehicles hit it and killed all four occupants," said one bystander, "People gathered around the crash site to see what happened, got angry and started attacking the foreigners."  Some witnesses say a person was killed when U.S. contractors opened fire on a gathering crowd, but the U.S. embassy denies this charge.Police fired shots in the air to disperse rioters who chanted "death to America" and "death to Karzai". Security forces say that the incident could provoke widespread riots, as happened after a similar incident in May 2006 sparked riots in Kabul.The African Union (AU) has agreed to consider a proposal to resettle Haitians affected by the recent magnitude 7.0 earthquake to Africa, and perhaps create a separate state for them on the continent.Abdoulaye Wade, the president of Senegal, first proposed the plan on January 17, saying that Haitians were descendants of slaves initially from Africa, and that gives them a right to return to the continent. Wade commented that African countries should naturalise Haitians wanting a new nationality, and called for a mass adoption programme."It is out of a sense of duty and memory and solidarity that we can further the proposal to create in Africa the conditions for the return of Haitians who wish to return after the effect of the disaster that ravaged Haiti," commented AU chairman Jean Ping at the AU's annual summit, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. "What happened to Haiti is a tragedy that transcends borders. We have attachment and links to that country. The first black republic in 1804, that carried high the flame of liberation and freedom for the black people and has paid a heavy price for so doing."The United Nations general-secretary, Ban Ki-moon, thanked the AU "for reaching out to Haiti in this time of need", remarking that "the nation of Haiti is an ocean away, yet I know it is close to every African heart. Today the Haitian people are enduring one of the greatest humanitarian challenges in recent years and loss of life on anunimaginable scale."The Haiti earthquake, which struck on January 12, is estimated to have killed approximately 170,000 people, and left over a million without homes.Wednesday marked the 100th day since the beginning of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and although the leaking well was recently capped, the estimated three million or more barrels of oil already in the Gulf of Mexico are still causing trouble for many residents of the Gulf coast.There are still many unanswered questions about the long-term impact of the spill, including how it has affected the environment and natural habitats of the Gulf as well as whether residents of the area will be able to return to their jobs and livelihoods now that the leak has been capped. US government officials say that, even after the oil well is permanently sealed, workers will still have a lot to do, including the removal of around 20 million feet (6.1 million metres) of containment boom. "I would characterize this as the first 100 days. There's a lot of work in front of us," said Rear Admiral Paul Zukunft of the US Coast Guard.Authorities will use submarines to assess damage underwater, while teams on the ground assess the shoreline. While removing oil from beaches is expected to be fairly straightforward, cleaning the marshlands will be particularly difficult, as boats are needed to maneuver through small channels and workers are unable to stand on solid ground. At least 638 miles (1,027 kilometres) of the Gulf coast have been hit by the oil.The government is focusing on both cleaning sensitive coastal regions and looking for underwater oil plumes, but is also probing into what may have been the largest accidental oil spill. The US Justice Department, as well as Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, are all investigating what contributed to the disaster. The Washington Post reported one team is looking into whether a close relationship between BP and government regulators played a role in the spill. The Post also said that Deepwater Horizon operator Transocean as well as oil services group Halliburton were being investigated.BP officials say that they will try to perform the "static kill" process on Monday, a process which involves pumping a thick mixture of mud and cement down into the cap currently stopping the leak. At the end of next week, one of two relief wells currently being drilled should reach the leaking well, and officials will then know if the static kill has worked. It is hoped that this "bottom kill" operation will be able to permanently seal the damaged well.Even though BP is close to sealing the oil reservoir, it still faces legal battles, economic struggles, and internal changes. On Tuesday, BP announced Tony Hayward would step down from his position as the company's chief executive. His replacement, American Bob Dudley, will be the first non-British CEO of the company.On Thursday, lawyers met at Boise, Idaho hearing to determine how around 200 various lawsuits against BP will play out. Depending on whether the suits can be consolidated, BP could be facing years of legal disputes. BP, Transocean, and Halliburton had already blamed each other for the disaster during a May hearing before the US Senate. Federal regulatory officials were criticized for allegedly taking bribes and not thoroughly inspecting the oil rig.The company also reported a quarterly loss of US$16.9 billion and said it has allocated US$32.2 billion to pay for the spill. BP has a US$20 billion fund to help make up for the massive losses of the Gulf fishing, oil, and tourism industries and will pay damages for each of the millions of barrels of oil lost in the disaster.BP says that it is the "responsible party" for cleaning up the spill because it owned the leaking well and had leased the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, but claims that it is not responsible for the entire spill.On Saturday, aftershocks of a powerful earthquake with reported magnitude 6.3 that struck southern Philippines on Wednesday night have increased the death toll of the extended event from five people to six due to a massive landslide following a 5.0 magnitude aftershock on Saturday.On Wednesday, the strong tremor left five dead and, by early reports, at least 30 injured. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) of the Philippines increased the previous death toll to six following the landslide caused by the 5.0 earthquake. Meanwhile, the total reported casualties increased to 167 from a previous 93 injured people.On Saturday, reports said Wednesday's quake affected the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Region 11 and Region 12. Over 2,000 residents near Mount Apo in Kidapawan City have been relocated to other villages in the city since Wednesday. 76 villages were affected according to NDRRMC report on Saturday, which figured 21 injured individuals in Davao del Sur, 36 in North Cotabato, 29 in South Cotabato and seven in General Santos City. Numbers of affected residents fear to return home due to the series of aftershocks, according to CNN Philippines.In a situational report of NDRRMC, Wednesday's tremor damaged 143 buildings including 70 schools, 40 houses, seven health facilities, two worshiping areas, and ten commercial buildings. Rappler reported three malls in Davao City and Gaisano Mall in Digos City were damaged following aftershocks.The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) reported the first quake occurred at 7:37 p.m. local time (1137 UTC) on Wednesday. Magnitude 6.3 according to Phivolcs, it was recorded as magnitude 6.4 by the US Geological Survey. It was followed by another earthquake an hour later; the second quake had a magnitude of 4.0 and was recorded in Sultan Kudarat. A 5.3-magnitude quake was recorded at 4:53 a.m Thursday morning (2053 Wednesday night, UTC) in Manay, Davao Oriental. According to Manila Bulletin, Wednesday's earthquake, at 6.3, was the strongest recorded impacting Kidapawan City. Phivolcs recorded 611 aftershocks as of Saturday 8:00 p.m. (1200 UTC).In response, many schools were closed on Thursday and after, with the provincial government in North Cotabato suspending classes province-wide. Charles Federic Plotena, the mayor of Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, announced classes for students ranging from kindergarten to high school, public and private, would be cancelled, while Sara Duterte, the mayor of Davao City, also cancelled graduate and post-graduate studies. Reportedly, at least two towns —including Makilala in the province of North Cotabato— declared a state of calamity following Wednesday's quake. Phivolcs said in its report, the western extension of Mindanao Fault makes the province seismically active, while the nearby Cotabato Trench contributes to earthquakes regionally.Aid agencies and Indian government officials have warned that there may be food shortages in the country, following severe floods that affected southern states.They said that agricultural production is likely to drop dramatically due to flooding of farmland and crops. Officials have predicted that food production in Andra Pradesh, one of the southern states most affected by flooding, will go down by over 900,000 tonnes.The waters are said to have ruined large quantities of grain stocks as well."Rice and other crops in an area of 260,000 hectares [642,000 acres] have been destroyed," said Andra Pradesh agricultural minister N. Raghuveera Rao.Jayakumar Christiandirector of World Vision India, an aid agency working in the region, said that "floods and drought have set back India's fight against poverty by years."Heavy flooding last week, mainly in Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring Karnataka, has killed about three hundred people and forced the evacuation of over a milion. The rains came after a prolonged period of drought.A South Korean aid agency reports that 110 North Korean villagers died in an explosion while trying to scavenge fuel from a cracked pipeline 10 days ago. The incident occurred in North Pyongan Province on June 9 when one of the villagers lit a match near a cracked segment of the pipeline, setting off fuel vapours."Informed sources told us that about 110 people were killed in the blast," Noh Oh-jae, an official for the group Good Friends, said.The National Intelligence Service in South Korea says it cannot confirm the reports.Aid has started to reach Myanmar after a recent cyclone in the region killed thousands. This is despite complaints that the government of the country is not allowing aid agencies full access.Large companies, including Google, have tried to encourage people to donate to aid agencies. On its website, Google wrote, "join the recovery efforts mobilizing around the world to assist cyclone victims in Myanmar. Your donation to either of these organizations will help survivors of the cyclone and other natural disasters rebuild their communities, and their lives."Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.Only once the rescue workers reached the most hard hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the damage that had taken place. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of Myanmar.Hundreds of thousands are homeless and another three thousand have been injured by the storm. Drinking water is contaminated and food is becoming scarce as the United Nations (U.N.) and other organizations try to get supplies to the region.Air France Flight 447 carrying 228 people from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport is reported missing off the Brazilian coast. The flight was scheduled to arrive in Paris at 11:10 CET on June 1, 2009.The Airbus A330-200 was last heard via radio at 22:30 local time (01:30 GMT). The Brazilian Air Force is confirming the disappearance of the aircraft, which vanished from radar approximately 190 miles (306 km) off the Brazilian coast. Reuters reports that an electrical short circuit during turbulence may have caused the plane to plunge into the Atlantic Ocean. The plane with registration F-GZCP has totalled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005. Its last maintenance check was on April 16, 2009."We have received no news from flight AF447," said Air France in a statement. The plane was carrying 12 crew members and 216 passengers, of which 126 men, 82 women, 7 children and one infant. In a press communiqué, Air France stated that AF447 had encountered an area of heavy turbulence at 02:00 GMT and that the aircraft had sent an automatic message indicating an electric failure at 02:14 UTC. Search and rescue operations by the Brazilian Air Force are to be initially centered on the island of Fernando de Noronha. The aircraft has been missing for a sufficient time that it will no longer have any fuel remaining if it was airborne.French President Sarkozy said the prospects of finding survivors are "very small". He also requested that America use their surveillance satellites to assist in locating the plane.Air France has provided three telephone numbers for the families and friends of those on board AF447: 0800 800 812 for calls from within France 0800 881 20 20 for calls from Brazil+33 1 57 02 10 55, for calls from outside France or Brazil.A "specially reserved area" of Charles de Gaulle airport's Terminal 2 is being used to care for the families of those on board AF447.More than two years after Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228, a French pilots union, a group supporting victims' families, and Air France have all criticised the ongoing investigation. The Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA) is being accused of trying to blame the pilots in order to absolve Airbus.The controversy follows the release of the BEA's latest interim report detailing findings so far. At the last moment, the BEA removed a recommendation added by chief investigator Alain Bouillard which called for alarms on Airbus A330s to be modified. The National Airline Pilots Union (SNPL) is concerned the investigation is degenerating "into a simple charge sheet against the crew," and says the latest revelations left them with "seriously damaged" faith in the investigators. The SNPL has withdrawn all support in the probe. Air France claim alarms on the A330-200 were "misleading" and contributed to the disaster. Robert Soulas, president of French victims' families group Entraide et Solidarité AF447, claims the move proves bias in the BEA.The dispute surrounds stall warning systems. An aircraft stalls if it no longer has sufficient speed to keep itself airbourne. The warnings cut out at extremely low speeds, meaning if a stall progresses far enough the warning can cease. The correct course of action in a stall is to lower the nose, increasing an aircraft's speed; if the speed increases, the warnings can sound again. This may confuse pilots into abandoning corrective measures.The BEA have responded that the last-minute call to remove a recommendation calling for changes to stall warning design was owing to a need to examine the issue further. They say behavioral psychologists and cockpit designers have been teamed up to look into the warnings and how crews respond to them. The BEA intends to make a recommendation on the issue in the future, and a spokesperson expressed "deep regret" at the SNPL's response.Friday's 117-page report did examine the actions and training of the pilots. The report says they were untrained in high-altitude manual flying and in how to identify and react to failures of speed sensors. Neither was a standard part of training at the time. The speed sensing system failed, causing the autopilot and autothrust to switch off. This was followed by stall warnings, which the interim BEA report say were ignored by pilots during a three-and-a-half minute fall of 38,000 feet into the ocean."The haste with which these authorities and these officials accused the pilots without any forethought aroused our suspicions," said Soulas. "We now have confirmation that the affirmations coming from the BEA were not only premature, (but) lacking any objectivity, partial and very oriented towards the defence of Airbus." For weeks his organisation has mounted protests against the direction taken by the investigation.Air France, who are battling legally with Airbus over responsibility (both firms are also under criminal investigation), wrote to the European Aviation Safety Agency asking that they examine the stall warnings and seek that they be changed in need be. Air France previously upgraded the speed sensors on their A330s.Junior Transport Minister Thierry Mariani defended the BEA. "There has never been such a transparent enquiry: it was filmed, took place under the judiciary's control, with Brazilian [and] American investigators. These controversies discredit an enquiry that is exemplary." Airbus also responded. "Can you imagine for an instant that, because of economic interests or links between the BEA and Airbus, we'd put in peril all the other airlines operating this plane? It's neither conceivable nor admissible," said a statement. About 180 airlines use the Airbus A330.A hijacked Air Mauritania Boeing 737 passenger plane has landed on Spain's Canary Islands after making a fuel stop in Western Sahara, officials in Mauritania said today. It was hijacked after the takeoff from the Nouakchott airport.While on the plane, the man demanded it to be flown to France to seek asylum.The 71 passengers and eight person crew were let out when the hijacker landed the plane in Las Palmas. Several people were wounded by a gun and the suspect was arrested.Reports say that it is unconfirmed as to what the man's motive was. Mauritanian police are still investigating.An Australian air safety group claims that Yogyakarta International Airport was opearating illegally with no license when Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, a Boeing 737, crashed at the airport, killing 16 Indonesians and five Australians.Flight Safety Pty Ltd had been asked to carry out an independent investigation by an anonymous client after the March 2007 disaster, which occurred when the aircraft landed at excessive speed and shot off the end of the runway. Flight Safety has now announced that they have found Yogyakarta International had been granted a five year license but this would be withdrawn after twelve months if several conditions were not met. Since these conditions remained unchanged, the license effectively voided six months before the disaster, claim Flight Safety. One of the conditions was extension of the runway and provision of an adequate Runway End Safety Area (RESA). The group adds that it also conducted checks on Solo International Airport and Semarang International Airport, and that these airports also had invalid Airport Operating Certificates. The final report was not released at the time as the client in question felt it 'too sensitive', and Flight Safety says that it was rapidly covered up three months later when it leaked in Indonesia.The group says it notified the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and that they in turn said the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) - who assisted in the crash investigation - was in control of the situation. However, Flight Safety claim that when approached, the ATSB denied knowing about it. Allegedly, the ATSB had missed the licensing discrepancy because they only checked the front page of the airport's license and did not conduct a detailed analysis of the small print.Flight Safety claim that the Indonesian Director of Aviation Safety told them that the situation had been rectified. However, the group have now conducted a re-audit and say Solo and Yogyakarta airports both remain illegal. They go on to accuse the ICAO, ATSB and Indonesian Director of Aviation Safety of "keeping quiet" and described them as 'compromised'.Flight Safety go on to claim that the survivors of the crash and relatives of the deceased have not been informed either, and say that this will have a serious effect on the compensation process and on any insurance claims. Crikey, an Australian news service, also suggested that AU$12 million of aid promised by Australia to help Indonesia improve air safety is also being misused. All Indonesia's air carriers are currently on the list of air carriers banned in the EU.An official statement by Flight Safety head Chris Weir concluded "It [the group's findings] should now be exposed as the safety issues remain unresolved."Mardjono Siswo Suwarno of the National Transport Safety Committee, the body responsible for investigating the disaster, denied that Yogyakarta Airport was illegal, saying "At that time [the license] was still valid, but the RESA was not long enough... But still in the [Garuda] case, even if the RESA length was adequate, the plane would have still overrun because the speed was 1.8 times normal speed."The final report found that the pilot-in-command, who has been arrested and charged over the crash, attempted to land after fifteen Ground Proximity Warning System activations to tell him he was landing too fast, and says that although a longer runway and full-sized RESA wouldn't have stopped an airliner traveling at such excessive speed it could have reduced the toll of deaths and injuries.The directors of Yogyakarta and Solo airports claim that since the re-audit they have taken steps to improve safety and rectify any problems, but have not actually admitted their airports were illegal. Indonesian director general of air transportation Budi Mulyawan Suyitno said that although local budget limitations have prevented some airports from being improved there are no problems currently at Yogyakarta, with improvements including declaration of a RESA for 140 metres of the 2,250 metre runway and stationing Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting trucks at the airport.Search and rescue teams today began recovering bodies after debris from Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 was spotted in the sea near Borneo.The flight from Surabaya to Singapore vanished from radar screens early on Sunday morning over the Java Sea. 155 passengers and seven crew were on board. Most were Indonesians, with three South Koreans, one Malaysian, one Brit and one French person on board.An Indonesian naval ship today recovered at least three bodies. TvOne broadcast uncensored footage that was seen by distressed relatives at Juanda International Airport, where the plane departed. TvOne has apologised and switched to blurred-out footage.Yesterday evening searchers stated they were using twelve helicopters, eleven planes, and 32 vessels. Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia sent assistance with the search. Local fishing boats have also joined. The US, UK, and France have been asked for help locating submerged remains. USS Sampson, a US Navy destroyer, is due to join search efforts today.National Search and Rescue Agency head Bambang Soelistyo says a "shadow" on the seabed, spotted by the air force, is thought to be the wreck site. The nearest airstrip is in Pangkalan Bun, Borneo, about 160km away.AirNav, the Indonesian national air traffic control (ATC) facility, yesterday said the aircraft was given permission to divert to avoid bad weather; the area was experiencing thunderstorms. That was at 6:12 local time. The flight crew next asked to climb from 32,000ft to 38,000ft. Controllers conferred with Singapore and agreed the plane could climb as high as 34,000ft with another flight preventing a higher altitude. When they radioed permission at 6:14 they received no answer. The flight vanished from radar at 6:17. The transponder ceased to be received a minute later.A leaked screenshot from an ATC radar screen shows the flight ascending without permission through 36,000ft with a ground speed of 353knts. The aircraft would normally be travelling faster, with an Emirates jet also on the screen showing a ground speed of 503knts at 36,000ft. An insufficient speed can cause an aircraft to stall.Indonesian Pilot Iriyanto and French co-pilot Remi Emmanuel Plesel did not explain their request to climb. They have over 8,000 hours experience between them. They were flying Airbus A320-200 registration PK-AXC and serial number 3648, which was six years old. It last underwent maintenance in November. Management company Doric own and lease the aircraft. The plane had accumulated 23,000 flying hours on 13,600 flights. It went missing around 40 minutes into a flight to Changi International Airport.Iriyanto's previous employers include the Indonesian Air Force, Merpati Airlines, and Adam Air. The 53-year-old also has ten years experience as a pilot trainer. He has flown for AirAsia for three years.Investigations are to be led by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee. France-based airframer Airbus, the BEA, which investigates aviation mishaps in France, and the US National Transportation Safety Board have all offered assistance.Reuters spoke to an anonymous source within the investigation. "Why did [Iriyanto] request to climb at that stage?" said the source. "Should he have climbed earlier? Other aircraft were flying at a higher altitude in that area. How did the two pilots react to the weather? We are asking those questions." The source said radar, weather, and communications data was being analysed.AirAsia owner Tony Fernandes said he has "full confidence in my[...] crew[...][Iriyanto] was extremely experienced". He added Iriyanto "came from the air force, one of their best graduates. He came from Surabaya, so he knows the area very well." Fernandes said it was "too early to speculate" about causes.AirAsia is based in Malaysia. 2014 has been a year of air disasters for the country; Malaysia Airlines flight 370 has been missing since March with 239 on board and in July Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in Ukraine with 298 casualties. Both involved Boeing 777 aircraft.AirAsia has a good record with no previous fatal accidents.An Indonesia AirAsia jet vanished over the Kumai region today. The flight carried 162 people.Among the 155 passengers and seven crew  flying from Surabaya to Singapore are three Koreans, one Malaysian, and one person variously reported as a French or UK national. The rest are Indonesians. There are sixteen children and an infant. The plane was diverting around weather formations over the Java Sea when contact with air traffic control (ATC) in Jakarta was lost.Local search and rescue have been told the flight last spoke to controllers at 6:12 local time seeking to climb from 32,000ft to 38,000ft. The flight vanished from radar at 6:17. The transponder ceased to be received a minute later. ATC issued a series of escalating alerts in response. It was due to enter Singaporean airspace at 6:52 and land by around 8:30.The Indonesian Navy, police forces, and National Search and Rescue Agency are focusing on an area 20 nautical miles from East Belitung. The plane went missing in the vicinity of Pulau Belitung Island. A rescue boat with a crew of 22 has been dispatched, with water police providing an additional vessel. The Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority is overseeing the efforts. Searches are presently suspended until morning.The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore is "ready to provide any assistance to support the search and rescue effort" according to a statement. The Singaporean military has sent two C-130 aircraft to assist. The Indian Navy has reportedly placed three ships and a Boeing P8-1 on standby to help.Australia has also offered assistance. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop telephoned her Indonesian equivalent, Retno Marsudi, to offer support. Bishop has also offered Australian assistance to South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott contacted Indonesian President Joko Widodo to offer sympathies and a P3 Orion plane.Areas for families and friends have been set up at Changi Airport where the flight was headed and at Juanda International Airport where it departed. The airline said in a statement they would "keep all parties informed as more information becomes available" about "the status of the passengers and crew members on board". "I hope I can get information soon on the whereabouts of our family members," one weeping woman at Juanda told Antara. She said she has four relatives on board and heard about the disappearance from news reports.The area where the plane vanished around 40 minutes into its trip was experiencing thunderstorms. Some clouds were as high as 50,000ft. The aircraft, Airbus A320-200 registration PK-AXC and serial number 3648, was six years old. It was undertaking flight designation QZ8501 and last underwent maintenance in November. Management company Doric own and lease the aircraft.Pilot Iriyanto  and co-pilot Remi Emmanuel Plesel have over 8,000 hours experience between them. Airbus released a statement saying the plane had accumulated 23,000 flying hours on 13,600 flights. The French-based airframer said it would assist investigators. The BEA, which investigates aviation mishaps in France, is liaising with their Indonesian counterparts at the National Transportation Safety Committee to provide assistance.The engines were built by CFM International, a joint enterprise between US firm General Electric and French engineering company Safran. The US connection means the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) can also join the probe.The NTSB says it is ready and willing to assist if required.A screenshot apparently leaked from an ATC radar screen shows the flight ascending through 36,000ft with a ground speed of 353knts. The aircraft would normally be travelling faster, with an Emirates jet also on the screen showing a ground speed of 503knts at 36,000ft."My only thought are with the passengers and my crew" said AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes. He said he is heading to Surabaya and thanked Malaysian, Singaporean, and Indonesian authorities for emergency efforts. Fernandes bought AirAsia for a symbolic price from the Malaysian government in 2002. By 2010 it had expanded from two aircraft to 86."I am touched by the massive show of support especially from my fellow airlines" said Fernandes. "This is my worst nightmare." He urged staff to "Pray hard. [...] Our priority is looking after all the next-of-kin for my staff and passengers."Djoko Murjatmodjo, acting head of transportation in Indonesia, said "We don't dare to presume what has happened except that it has lost contact." Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he is "saddened" and his "thoughts are with the passengers and their families". Pope Francis used today's address in St. Peter's Square, the Vatican to say he was praying for the missing. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called the news "Very sad to hear[...] My thoughts are with the families. Malaysia stands ready to help."The British Embassy in Jakarta has acknowledged reports a UK citizen may be missing. US President Barack Obama has also been briefed. Initial reports claim AirAsia did not include British when listing the nationalities missing, but the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office say a UK victim's next of kin have been informed.The present version of AirAsia's statement lists a UK passenger and a French crewmember. France24 identifies co-pilot Plesel as French.AirAsia is based in Malaysia. 2014 has been a year of air disasters for the country; Malaysia Airlines flight 370 has been missing since March with 239 on board and in July Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in Ukraine with 298 casualties. Both involved Boeing 777 aircraft.AirAsia has a good record with no previous major crashes.A car accident involving the car occupants and a dentist's office happened on Sunday night in Santa Ana, California. A white Nissan sedan which was apparently driving too fast hit the raised concrete median on the road, after which it was launched into the air, slamming straight into the wall of the second floor of a two-story dental practice building, where the car got wedged. According to the police, the car approached from a side street. The room of the dental office penetrated by the sedan was used as a storage space. A fire department crane was used to extract the vehicle from the building, which took several hours.There were two people in the sedan. One of them managed to escape from the hanging vehicle on his own, while the other one remained trapped inside it for over an hour. They were both hospitalized with minor injuries, according to the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA). According to the police, the driver of the car admitted narcotics use, and after toxicology tests the case is to be submitted to the Orange County District Attorney's Office.The moment of the accident was captured by surveillance video from a bus which the car narrowly missed when becoming airborne.According to OCFA spokesperson Captain Stephen Horner, there was a small fire after the crash, which was extinguished quickly.An Airbus A320 airliner owned by Air New Zealand crashed into the Mediterranean Sea near Perpignan, killing at least two of a crew of seven, French officials reported on Thursday.The aircraft crashed at about 5 p.m. local time (1600 UTC) during a test flight. The twin-engine jet airliner had just undergone maintenance at Perpignan in preparation for its return to Air New Zealand by German airline XL Airways, which had been operating it on lease.The seven on board included two XL Airways crew, Civil Aviation Authority inspector Jeremy Cook of Wellington, and four Air New Zealand personnel. Air New Zealand has identified involved personnel as Captain Brian Horrell and Murray White of Auckland, and Michael Gyles and Noel Marsh of Christchurch. No additional passengers were on board for the flight, which was part of a maintenance test procedure. At least two bodies have been recovered. Though rescue efforts persisted into the night, there is no hope of the remaining five crew members being found alive, according to French officials.The cause of the crash is not yet clear. The pilots may have attempted an emergency landing on water. Efforts are underway to recover the aircraft's black box. French, German, and New Zealand aviation authorities and investigators have been dispatched to the site to investigate the incident. Manufacturer Airbus, based in Toulouse, will aid the investigation, Airbus spokespersons stated.A Civil Aviation Authority spokesperson stated that the incident does not cast any doubt on the airworthiness of the A320 design, a popular aircraft which has been involved in only ten fatal accidents since its introduction in 1987. Air New Zealand's fleet includes 13 A320s.A test flight of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo, the largest passenger jet in the world, was delayed today after a superficial accident at Suvarnabhumi Airport, which serves Bangkok, Thailand.The minor accident occurred during push back, as the aircraft was leaving a parking space before it was due to fly to Chiang Mai International Airport. As the jet was being pushed back by a Thai Airways International tug operator, the left winglet struck the side of the hangar, and was crumpled against it.The winglets, designed to improve fuel efficiency, are non-vital parts. After an inspection, Airbus decided to remove both winglets and continue the flight without them. The plane left four hours after its scheduled 9:45 a.m. local time departure, carrying 150 passengers.The flight was intended to counteract criticisms that the massive airliner, which has a 79-metre wingspan, is too big (and thus too complex for ground crews) to be practically operated at most airports. It also demonstrates continuing problems at Suvarnabhumi airport, which has suffered various incidents since it opened last September, the most severe of which being the discovery of large cracks in airport taxiways shortly after opening.Airbus has said they will continue with their tour of Asia demonstrating the plane.Airbus have announced that they will be willing to contribute between €12 million and €20 million (about US$16 million to $28 million) to fund an extended search for the black boxes from Air France Flight 447. The Airbus A330 jetliner crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June, killing all 228 people on board.Chief executive Thomas Enders said in a statement, "We want to know what happened, as improving air safety is our top priority. We are fully committed to support the extension of the search with a significant contribution." Although airframers normally supply technical assistance to investigations, the required impartiality makes funding rare, with Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath saying the company's move was unprecedented."This is an exceptional accident and an exceptional situation," Schaffrath explained. France's investigative agency BEA has requested financial assistance for the search from both Airbus and Air France. Air France have discussed this possibility with the BEA.Investigators have already given up looking for the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder using the conventional method of tracing audio 'pingers', the batteries of which would have expired after 30–40 days.  Efforts are ongoing using sensitive equipment under tow from a French naval vessel, but if this search proves fruitless then the BEA will seek money for a further three-month search.The jet's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was able to transmit information regarding problems on board prior to the crash. The ACARS data suggests that the plane had suffered from a loss of valuable readings including airspeed, leading suspicion to fall on the pitot-static system which supplies various measurements. Airbus had already recommended that one component of this system, the pitot tubes, be replaced on A330s. Air France had not done this on the accident airplane although the entire fleet now features the modified design. Three other incidents have been identified since that may involve similar circumstances. The United States National Transportation Safety Board is probing two over American soil while earlier this month another Air France A330 equipped with the new tubes suffered a similar series of problems enroute from Italy to France.An aircraft dating back to the Second World War has crashed at Shoreham Airshow in West Sussex, United Kingdom whilst participating in a mock dogfight, killing the pilot. The plane was with the Royal Air Forces Association  and had been performing in a Battle of Britain display.Witness Tim Deakin described the chain of events to BBC News 24: "The main point of the show was a Second World War dogfight between some Messerschmitts and some Spitfires. Midway through the dogfight one of the planes, I'm not sure which one, literally, turned quite steeply, went into almost a straight dive and ploughed into a hill probably about a mile from the airfield. There's still quite a bit of confusion about which aircraft it was."Witness Holly Russell had some more details: "They were doing a mock dog fight and it looked like the plane was doing a dive, but it was going too fast and smashed straight into the ground. It was nose down... There was a mushroom cloud of black smoke."Authorities could not confirm any injuries or fatalities, but the missing man formation was performed in a flyby shortly after the crash. The plane went down into a field near the A27, about a mile from the airfield. Emergency services and a police helicopter attended the scene. The plane was a Hurricane, one of three performing alongside the two Spitfires and five Messerschmitts.The show is thought to have been attended by about 20,000 people, and was delayed by about 30 minutes after the crash. However, eventually a tannoy (PA) announcement stated that the pilot "would have wanted them to carry on", and the show continued. The crash occurred on the first day of the two days the annual airshow is scheduled to take.Officials have requested for anyone filming the airshow at the time to come forward in the hope that the footage will assist in investigating the cause of the crash.A Flybe, Bombardier Q400, had to make an emergency landing at Edinburgh Airport in Scotland after it had engine troubles on its scheduled flight from Manchester.Thirty-six passengers were onboard flight BE7220 when the captain made the Mayday call to air traffic control at approximately 07:40 BST. The captain was forced to shut down one of the plane's two turboprop engines before finally landing safely at Edinburgh Airport at 07:50 BST.Upon landing the plane was met by fire engines and other emergency vehicles before taxiing to the terminal building.Jim Mulhall, a passenger on board the plane said, "When the captain told us they were going to cut an engine everyone went quiet, probably because they were apprehensive."Normal operations at the airport have since resumed, while the aircraft is expected to resume commercial flying this afternoon.Wreckage from an airplane in the Atlantic Ocean 650 kilometres from the coast of Brazil has been confirmed by the Brazilian government to be from Air France Flight 447.Nelson Jobim, the Brazilian Defence Minister, said that there were no survivors.An airplane seat and life vest were found floating in Atlantic waters on Tuesday. A French ship arrived at the area on the same day, and confirmed the debris. According to CNN, a vessel from the Brazilian navy is to arrive at the scene on Wednesday.The main goal for search crews will be to find the cockpit voice and data recorder to help find out what caused the crash. However, the Brazilian defence minister said that it may be hard to find them due to the large depth of the ocean in the area, saying that "it could be at a depth of 2,000 or 3,000 metres [6,500 to 9,800 feet] in that area of the ocean."Air France Flight 447 was an Airbus A330 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France, with 228 people on board, when it vanished from radar screens after entering an area with severe turbulence.Qantas, Australia's primary airline, has begun checking the batteries of Dell and Apple computers and in some cases removing them for the safety of the passengers. This relatively new safety precaution was sparked by a battery recall a few months ago. 4 million Dell laptops worldwide were recalled after some of the laptop batteries exploded, causing the laptop to erupt into a fireball.Although Qantas has yet to release a statement, they are expected to within the next few days. The company said in an interview that the practice has been occurring for a number of months for the passengers' safety to mitigate the rare chance of fire.—Sharron, an employee of Qantas.An airliner has suffered an explosion and caught fire at Soekarno-Hatta Airport in Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia. The plane was being dismantled for spare parts and there were no injuries.The plane was at a maintenance facility operated by Garuda Maintenance Facilities, a subsidiary of Garuda Indonesia. Ownership of the plane is unclear, with Tempo Interactive saying that reports indicated Thailand's Phuket Air owns the plane and the Jakarta Globe quoting GMF corporate secretary Dwi Prasmono Adji as saying the plane belonged to Global Air Services.Adji also told the Globe that the aircraft has been parked at the airport for the last five years. "The airline has gone bankrupt and the plane was being taken apart so they can resell the pieces," and the fire occurred as several technicians cut the plane up, he said.Herry Bhakti Singayuda, the Ministry of Transportation's director general of civil aviation, attributed the explosion to the presence of fuel in lines on the plane's right wing, which was being cut up. Singayuda also said the accident occurred outside a hanger and prevented injuries. GMF spokeswoman Siska Tobing said the explosion was heard at Terminal 1 of the airport, which serves Jakarta.Singayuda and other Indonesian officials are currently in negotiations with the European Union in the hope of removing the nation's carriers from the list of airlines banned in the EU. This event is the second such coincidence, with the EU's last visit in March seeing one of Lion Air's McDonnel-Douglas planes crash-landing at the same airport.Four people have been injured after a passenger plane on a repositioning flight crashed at Durban International Airport, South Africa. The crew was attempting a crash landing in a playing field after the Jetstream 41 aircraft developed engine trouble.The aircraft, which belonged to Airlink, ran into difficulties shortly after takeoff, with at least one engine failing and smoke entering the cabin.  It crashed about three kilometres from the airport, or 400m from the perimeter, leaving both flight crew, a flight attendant and a bystander on the ground with multiple injuries.  No-one else was involved, and at least one person needed to be cut from the wreckage.The crash at a high school field narrowly missed houses. The bystander was a cleaner who was struck by the aircraft, and is in critical condition with broken legs. The flight attendant hurt her back and face. The captain suffered injuries to his legs and face, and the first officer broke her hand, both her ankles, her hip and her ribs. She has had surgery, the others are awaiting it.An investigation into the crash has been launched by the South African Civil Aviation Authority.42 people have died in the crash of an airplane that was flying to Yichun in the province of Heilongjiang, north-eastern China, on Tuesday. 54 people, including the captain, survived the crash. Chinese government news agency Xinhua reported that the Embraer 190 jet missed the runway during landing, was damaged and caught fire. The aircraft had taken off in Harbin.The reason for the crash is not yet clear. However, at the time of the accident, reports indicate that the Yichun Lindu Airport was engulfed in thick fog, though the local weather bureau contradicts this. A surviving passenger reported that the aircraft began to burn well before it came to rest. Many people then rushed to the front, instead of taking the emergency exits. The heavy smoke generated by the fire made breathing difficult.  Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.There were 91 passengers and five crew members aboard the jetliner.  According to a Xinhua report yesterday, at least five of the survivors, including three children, remained in a critical condition, and several more are seriously injured.This is the first major civil aviation crash in China since the crash of a China Eastern Airlines CRJ-200 in 2004. 55 people were killed in that crash.Bellview Airlines Flight 210 has crashed in Lagos, Nigeria. The Boeing 737 was carrying over 100 passengers.The plane took off from the International Airport in Lagos for the capital Abuja at 8:45pm and lost contact with the control tower five minutes later.A small airplane crashed yesterday in southeast Alaska, killing five and injuring four. Alaska State Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said that among the survivors is a two-year-old girl. Ketchikan Public Safety Director Rich Leipfert told the Ketchikan Daily News that three of the injured were transported to hospitals.Leipfert also said that the plane, belonging to SeaWind Aviation, crashed into a tree at Traitors Cove, an area about 25 miles north of Ketchikan. SeaWind Aviation's web site lists the aircraft as a deHavilland Beaver floatplaneIdentifications of those killed or of those injured were not currently available. The bodies are to be recovered today due to inclement weather and darkness on Thursday.The cause is under investigation. However, there were reportedly very high winds in the area at the time of the crash.The aircraft involved in this accident is understood to be N345KA which was also involved in a crash in July 2000 whilst with a different owner. According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report of the incident, the aircraft suffered substantial damage after its left wing struck a tree whilst attempting to take-off. The pilot, the only person on-board, was not injured. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was pilot error in inadequately compensating for the wind conditions.Twenty-four people, among them seven children, were killed on Sunday after their airplane crashed in a river in Brazil. Four people survived the crash, including a 9-year-old boy. The aircraft, which was a twin-engine Embraer turboprop chartered by Manaus Aerotaxis, was carrying 26 passengers and two crew members when it crashed.The pilots of the plane, which had departed from Coari, had supposedly contacted the air traffic control near their destination of Manaus to announce that they were turning back. The plane, however, then disappeared from radar. The plane made an emergency landing in the river Manacapuru, a branch the Amazon river in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Manaus.Rescue teams were dispatched immediately, and four passengers from the accident were recovered alive and in reportedly good condition. The rest of the passengers were found inside the plane. The rescue effort was made more difficult by nightfall and heavy rains.According to passenger reports, one of the plane's engines stopped shortly before the crash. Some survivors also said that they managed to jump out of a door in the back of the aircraft before impact.The authorities, who are still investigating the cause of the accident, suspect that the plane tried to make an emergency landing at the Panamacapuru airport nearby, but ditched in the river instead after falling short by half a kilometer. Heavy rain was reported when the plane went down and bad weather is hampering the investigation. Operations to recover the wreckage have been suspended until the weather improves.At least 98 people have been confirmed dead and a further fifteen wounded after an Indonesian Air Force Hercules C-130 airplane crashed in a housing area in the city of Magetan, East Java in Indonesia early Wednesday.The plane had taken off from the country's capital of Jakarta and was preparing to land at a military base nearby the crash site."As such the total number of people dead or injured so far is 113, including the two people on the ground. Meanwhile, reports of another person who died but has not been found cannot be verified as yet," said Banbang Sulistyo, the air force's chief of information. He added that investigations are currently ongoing to determine what caused the accident.The cause of the incident is as of yet uncertain, as the plane was reported to have been in good condition, and the weather was suitable for landing.Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called an emergency meeting at his presidential palace with the Armed Forces and Air Force chief and defence minister."From the explanation I received from them [...] it cannot be determined yet if the crash was because of weather conditions, mechanical failure or human error. It's better not to speculate what caused the crash," he told reporters after the meeting," the president said.Witness reports say there was an explosion shortly before the plane crashed. "I heard at least two big explosions and saw flashes of fire inside the plane," said an eyewitness, a man working in a rice field near where the aircraft crashed. "The wing snapped off and fell to the ground."The accident is the deadliest in the Indonesian Air Force's history since an airplane crash in 1991 in Condet, East Java, which killed 135 people.A Boeing 737-800 registered to Turkish Airlines with 135 people on board crashed at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on Tuesday. At least nine people, including the three pilots, were killed and over 80 had been injured. The plane was traveling from Istanbul, Turkey.The airplane crashed short of the runway, close to the A9 highway, and broke into three pieces. According to witness reports, about twenty people were seen walking away from the crash."The plane was nose up and the tail section was at a 45-degree angle. The tail section broke down first, which broke off," said a witness in an interview with the BBC who was riding on his bicycle by the airport when the aircraft crashed. "And seconds after the crash people started exiting through the tail section [...] I saw dozens of people making it out very quickly, and as I was about to dial 112 the first sirens were noticeable, and within five minutes there were 10 or 15 ambulances." During the press conference, it was stated that a total of 60 ambulances went to the crash site and 150 medical people were present. Special vehicles were also used to enter the field, which wasn't easily accessible.A passenger on-board the plane gave this account: "We suddenly descended a great distance as if the plane fell into turbulence. The plane's tail hit the ground [...] It slid from the side of the motorway into the field," he said.Officials have not yet determined what caused the accident. "We cannot say anything about the cause at the moment. The priority of the authorities is providing help and care," stated the vice-mayor of the Haarlemmermeer municipality, Michel Bezuijen.72 Turkish and 32 Dutch people were on board the aircraft, according to the Turkish ambassador to the Netherlands.A DC-9, operated by privately owned, Sosoliso Airlines, crashed in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, reportedly killing at least 103 people. Seven people are reported to have survived the crash.Landing during an electrical storm, the plane overshot the runway and burst into flames. The aircraft broke into three main pieces, scattering passengers and wreckage.Some 75 children returning home for the holidays are among the victims.During a heavy thunderstorm at around 19:00 GMT, a plane crashed into a block of flats in the suburb of Yeoville in Johannesburg.The pilot was killed on impact. No one on the ground was injured.The plane is believed to be a Piper Cherokee 140 that was probably heading towards Lanseria Airport.Yesterday morning near the international airport located on Weno island of Chuuk state of the Federated States of Micronesia, Oceania a passenger airplane of model Boeing 737-800 flown by the Air Niugini carrier crashed into sea as its pilot missed the runway. All 47 people on board — by differing reports, 36 passengers and eleven crew or 35 passengers and twelve crew — survived.The report by the international commercial aviation safety organization Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre indicated the crash coincided with a sudden intensification of the weather conditions. timeanddate.com-supplied data from CustomWeather reported rain showers at 9:40 a.m. local time, following cloudy conditions at 8:50 a.m.The airplane reportedly landed around 9:30 a.m. local time, short of the runway by about 160 m to 200 m (about 525 to 650 feet), according to reports. Locals immediately began to rescue the passengers and crew on fishing boats. Officials arrived after about ten minutes, according to a witness quoted by The Guardian.In an interview, a passenger alleged the crew started panicking and yelling, The Guardian reported. A first responder, Dr James Yaingeluo, also said the airplane crew were in panic. He said, "There was a little bit [of] chaos at first because everybody was really panicked and tried to get out of the plane [...] other than that we were doing as much as we can. Luckily there are no casualties."Yaingeluo said nine people were taken to a hospital. Four people remained in hospital, one "seriously injured", according to reports recounted by ABC News on Friday evening.Flight 73 was coming from Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia. Its destination was Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea, with a stop at the Chuuk state.A Nigerian airplane crashed in the city of Port Harcourt yesterday, resulting in several minor injuries.The plane was supposed to be taking part in a mock rescue exercise, and was carrying 30 members from the National Emergency Management Agency and other emergency workers, when it slid off the runway and into some bushes after landing at Port Harcourt International Airport.The rescue workers on the ground, intended to participate in the emergency drill, instead had to deal with a real emergency; however, only a few people on board the aircraft sustained minor wounds.A spokeswoman for the police, Rita Inoma-Abbey, commented today that "[n]o life was lost, but the aircraft was severely damaged."Investigators have stated that Continental Connection Flight 3407, which crashed in icy weather near Buffalo, New York on February 12, was on autopilot when it went down, and that the pilot flying the aircraft might have violated the airline's policy and federal safety recommendations.The plane involved in the incident was a Bombardier Dash 8, which crashed into a home located at 6038 Long Street in Clarence Center, a suburb of Buffalo. It went down at approximately 10:17 p.m. EST (03:20 UTC), February 12. 44 passengers, an off-duty pilot, and four crew members died in the accident, as well as one person on the ground.When the plane crashed, it was carrying over 2.5 tonnes (5,000 pounds) of fuel. Amid rain and sleet, the aircraft exploded into a huge orange fireball, sparking a large fire which emergency crews had to contain. Twelve houses near the crash site were evacuated.Steve Chealander, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said that the company which operated the flight suggests the pilot to fly manually when conditions are icy, saying that "you may be able in a manual mode to sense something sooner than the autopilot can sense it.""If the autopilot is left on while the ice is building up, the pilot may suddenly be confronted with a very difficult situation," said William Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, speaking to the Toronto Star. "Ice actually changes the shape of the wing. If you don't keep the wings clean you could find yourself in a situation where [...] suddenly the aircraft decides to quit flying."The airplane's data recorders suggest that there was a significant accumulation of ice on the aircraft's wings and windshield before it crashed. Shortly before the crash, according to the flight voice recorder, the pilots were talking about the poor weather and ask the traffic controller for permission to descend. The airplane's de-icing system had been turned on before the crew had discussed the ice. Recordings of communications seemed to be normal until soon before impact, and the flight crew did not notify air traffic control of any problems.Investigations have suggested that the aircraft was headed away from its destination airport when it went down.A midair collision today killed a pilot during an airshow in the village of Dittingen in Switzerland.The crash occurred as three Ikarus C42 planes from the German Grasshopper display team flew together in formation. Two collided and crashed, with one pilot ejecting and parachuting to safety and the other remaining on board and being killed. The third plane was not directly involved and landed successfully.The northern Swiss village is near Basel. Basel-Landschaft police spokesman Meinrad Stoecklin put the time of the accident at 11:30a.m. The airshow was first halted as rescuers arrived, then cancelled altogether. It is unclear if there are any additional injuries.Authorities have closed down access to the scene. The killed pilot's plane struck a barn. The display team reportedly was using amateur pilots.It is the third deadly European airshow crash in four days. On Thursday two planes carrying parachutists collided and crashed in West Slovakia. At least seven were killed. They had been practising for an airshow due to be held this weekend. Yesterday a vintage warplane crashed onto a busy road by Shoreham in England. Seven are confirmed dead, with the pilot critical and police continuing to search the scene for more bodies.Tragedy struck Huntsville, Alabama Monday morning when a school bus transporting Lee High School students to a local trade school careened over a retaining wall on an elevated part of Interstate 565 at the U.S. highway 231 exit and plummeted 30 feet. Killed in the initial crash were Nicole Ford, 19, Christine Collier, 16. Tanesha Hill, 17, died later at Huntsville Hospital. A fourth victim,  Crystal Renee McCrary, 17, died Tuesday. Anthony Scott, the bus driver, and 14 students remain hospitalized, according to Huntsville Hospital spokeswoman Pam Sparks. Huntsville Police spokesman Wendell Johnson said a 1990 Toyota Celica apparently hit the Laidlaw Education Services-contracted school bus. The bus driver apparently attempted evasive action, and a reaction sent the right tire climbing up the protective barrier. The buses momentum caused it to teeter on the wall briefly, flipped upside down, careening headlong onto the ground below. It was unclear if the driver jumped or was ejected, though National Transportation Safety Board spokeswoman Debbie Hersman said the bus driver was found on the overpass, and that, "We are trying to determine why the bus driver was on the overpass." Investigating agencies at federal, state and local levels include the NTSB, Alabama State Department of Transportation, Alabama Department of Public Safety, and Huntsville Police Department. Thad Sokolowski, a 17-year-old Lee High School eyewitness said, "The orange car was going to pass the bus. He thought something was wrong with the car, like his tire got blown out because it started fishtailing." He added that the orange Toyota hit the bus, "but not hard. It was a bump," adding that the bus "skidded down the rail and it was gone." His description of the wreck was given to his mother, Bonnie Sokolowski, and published in the Huntsville Times, because he did not want to speak with reporters. Police Chief Rex Reynolds said evidence will be presented to a Grand Jury, as is required by state law for fatalities involving minors, and added that charges have not yet been filed against the 17-year old Toyota driver. Chief Reynolds said the bus driver had a clean driving record. Mass chaos ensued and Crestwood Medical Center and Huntsville Hospital, the two local hospitals, both activated their Mass Casualty action plans. Emergency response personnel from throughout the area were called upon to assist in rescue efforts. Huntsville Hospital emergency room physician Dr. Sherrie Squyres said all off-duty hospital medical and nursing personnel were requested to return to work, and that three trauma surgeons and one neurosurgeon were committed exclusively to accident response. Among the problems facing hospital and rescue personnel was the absence of personal identification among the victims. Huntsville City Schools Superintendent Dr. Ann Roy Moore said that the Lee High School principal had initiated a student ID card program, "but not every student carried the ID."Brad Holley, Field Director for Alabama Department of Education, noting the tragedy said "We have not had a student killed while riding a school bus since 1969." Huntsville's last school bus related fatality was November 19, 1968 when a bus transporting students from Lee High Chapman Junior High Schools careened off Bankhead Parkway on Monte Sano Mountain above Tollgate Road. Faulty brakes caused that wreck.The Alaskan cruise ship "Empress of the North" was given the order to evacuate at 2 AM Alaska Time this morning after striking an underwater rock and taking on water. All 281 passengers and 29 crew are unharmed and the passengers have been evacuated, though the ship is listing roughly 8 degrees. The US Coast Guard has stated the ship is in no danger of sinking, but tell news reporters that the captain of the ship gave the order to evacuate to be safe. The ship's current location is 24 km (15 miles) southeast of Juneau, Alaska in an area of the Eastern peninsula known as the Icy Strait. Though it is unknown exactly what penetrated the ship's hull at this time, it is suspected by the captain and US Coast Guard that it was an underwater rock. This all occurred during the night hours on the second day of a seven day long cruise through the Alexander Archipelago and Inside Passage in southeastern Alaska.Dan Miller, representative for "Majestic America" has said the ship "is stable and is under its own power and as soon as all the guests and crew are transferred off, she will make her way under her own power over to Juneau where we will assess the damage."Several civilian pleasure-craft arrived at the scene and have taken some passengers off of the ship. The ships involved in this rescue operation were a commercial tugboat, a barge, 6 pleasurecraft, an Alaska Marine Highway ferry, and another cruise ship.As of 1:00 PM Eastern Time, all of the passengers have been transferred to an Alaskan Ferry, heading back to Juneau. The 29 crew members have stated they will remain on board to help bring the ship back to port in Juneau for investigation and repairs.The 109-meter long Empress of the North is owned by "Majestic America", a division of Ambassadors Cruise Group, which is in turn, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ambassadors International.Mount Redoubt, an active volcano west of Anchorage, Alaska, has erupted, according to the USGS Volcano Center.Between 10:38pm on March 22 and 1:39am Alaska time on March 23, the USGS recorded four explosions at the volcano, which had been giving indications of an imminent eruption since 15 March. The USGS has issued a "code red" aviation warning and a volcano warning.According to the Alaska Volcano Observatory, a fifth explosion began at about 4:38am Alaska time.According to the National Weather Service, showers of volcanic ash have already been reported in Skwentna, Alaska and are possible in the Susitna Valley. Residents of those areas are advised to minimize driving, cover air intakes and open water supplies, and remain indoors.However, Peter Cervelli of the Alaska Volcano Observatory said that "Anchorage might dodge the bullet" and come through the eruption unscathed. Dave Stricklan of the National Weather Service predicted a "light dusting" of fine ash that would disrupt air travel but not seriously affect people on the ground. Mudflows may affect the Drift and Crescent Rivers.Mount Redoubt last erupted in late 1989, causing mudflows which put an oil refinery at risk while ash from the eruption stalled the engine of a passing airliner. US$160 million worth of damage was estimated to have been caused.Survivors of this weekend's airplane crash in Alaska, United States say they saw the forward cargo door of their Piper Piper PA-31 Navajo Chieftain swing open shortly after takeoff. The plane crashed into frigid waters a short distance from the runway, killing six of the ten on board, including the pilot, and leaving the other four hospitalized.The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident, and NTSB investigator Clint Johnson said "There have been some incidents and accidents that did result from the door coming open. We don't know yet if there are similarities." He refused to speculate on accident cause, pointing out that a full investigation would take some time to complete.The remains of the fuselage have been laid out in a maintenance hangar close to the Kodiak Island accident site and is scheduled for examination tomorrow pending arrival of an accident investigation representative from Piper, who will provide detailed technical assistance. The nine-passenger complement had chartered the Servant Air plane to fly to Homer, and represented maximum capacity for the twin-engined plane.It appears that the survivors were seated at the rear of the plane. The deceased were identified as pilot Robin Starrett, 50, of Kodiak and five Homer residents - Stefan F. Basargin, 36, Pavel F. Basargin, 30, Zahary F. Martushev, 25, Iosif F. Martushev, 15, and Andrian Reutov, 22. The survivor's names have now also been released; they are Karnely Ivanov, 32, of Anchor Point, Feodot Basargin, 33, of Anchorage, Anton Rijkoff, 30, of Anchorage, and Andrean Basargin, 25, of Homer.There have been two previous cases of Alaskan Piper Navajo crashes confirmed to have been caused by open forward cargo hatches. In April 1990 a compartment opened during takeoff from Deadnight; this caused separation of an engine cover which proceeded to strike and damage the horizontal stabilizer. No-one was injured.It was discovered that a vital spring designed to exert pressure and thus keep the door shut was missing; the operator had improvised its own device to shut the door without correctly locking it.The second crash occurred in May 1996. A Cape Smythe Air Services owned-and-operated aircraft attempting takeoff at Point Hope had its forward door unexpectedly open as the nose lifted off. Cargo went through the left propeller, forcing an emergency crash landing on the ice severely injuring two people. The pilot had loaded the hold and then visually inspected the door.  Under the false impression that it had been secured properly he proceeded to takeoff. He had originally attempted to turn the aircraft around and told the NTSB he had thought that the aircraft should have been able to fly despite the open door, although he appreciated aircraft documentation did not specifically mention such conditions.Small, local-based Servant Air had been operating the 1979 aircraft since 2004 without any difficulties. As with many such carriers, the pilot is responsible for loading and checking the door. The door is approximately 3 1/2 feet wide and 2 1/2 feet high.All 2,500 runners in the Lake District's Original Mountain Marathon, a fell running event, were accounted for this afternoon.  As previously reported, 1,700 runners had been missing.The police reported that all participants were located by 2:25pm GMT.  The RAF was called in for helicopter rescues and retrieved five runners.  Most runners sheltered overnight at sites including the Honister Slate Mine, Cockermouth Sheep and Wool Centre, Glaramar Outdoor Pursuit Centre and Cockermouth School after torrential rains flooded the Cumbria fell marathon course.Thirteen participants were taken to hospital to be treated for hypothermia and minor injuries including a woman washed into a river by the flooding who was rescued by fellow runners and a 52-year old Nottingham man who slipped and broke his leg.Funerals began Monday across Newfoundland for the deceased of the downed Sikorsky S92 helicopter that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on Friday killing 17 of the 18 people on board. All bodies have now been recovered, and the voice and flight data recorders have been retrieved to aid the investigation.“We have a big attachment to the sea, even if a family is not directly involved you know how dangerous it is out there. Some funerals are strictly a family matter. In this situation there's a large extended family because we're all affected,” said Jim Maher, the uncle of Allison Maher, 26, the first deceased recovered after the crash.The Archbishop of St. John's, Martin Currie, said, “Tragedy is no stranger to the people of Newfoundland. They're very resilient people and in a time of tragedy, they come together to support each other. Most of the communities in Newfoundland are small communities. Everybody knows everybody." The Transportation Safety Board has retrieved nine more bodies from the wreckage. The Atlantic Osprey is the offshore supply vessel which has been with the search and rescue effort since day one. The newly recovered bodies were taken back to St. John's aboard the ship.Since the recovery operations began Monday "it took 24 hours to get nine bodies out Each presents its own challenges depending on how it is entangled inside the aircraft" said RCMP Sergeant Wayne Newell.Operations continued Tuesday to recover the final seven bodies tangled inside the mangled wreck 120 to 150 meters (394 to 492 feet) below the ocean surface. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)  are being used in the icy waters to place the bodies in a basket so they can be raised to the surface. After the Atlantic Osprey arrived in port, the bodies were taken to the Newfoundland's chief medical officer by hearse for identification.Of the 19 people aboard, Robert Decker is the sole survivor. Decker's family has informed the RCMP that he is not yet able to communicate. Decker, who was put on life support when first admitted to hospital with injured lungs and broken bones, has said a few words; RCMP investigators hope that he will be able explain what happened in the accident and assist with the investigation, possibly toward the end of the week.  Twelve names of the missing victims had previously been announced, and with family permission, the RCMP have now released the names of Corey Eddy, from Paradise, N.L., age 32, and John Pelley, from Deer Lake, N.L. age 41.All eight crewmembers on board a Kata Air Transport Antonov An-32 that crashed on April 12 in Moldova are confirmed to have died. The news comes as Moldova requests Russia assist the investigation by analysing the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR).The Sudanese operated and registered plane, manufactured in Ukraine, had departed Chişinău International Airport to travel to Khartoum via Antalya. The aircraft had rapidly disappeared from radar after takeoff due to a believed transponder failure. After air traffic control informed the flight crew a decision was made to return and perform an emergency landing, but the aircraft crashed before this could be achieved at 22:15 local time (20:15 GMT).The crew consisted of four Moldovans and four Ukrainians. Seven bodies have been identified.Today at 4:03 p.m. EDT (2003 UTC) Air France Flight 358, an Airbus A340 from Paris, crashed at the end of Runway 24L of Toronto's Pearson International Airport. Following flights to Toronto were diverted to airports in Ottawa and Winnipeg. Over 3 dozen people who suffered non-life threatening injuries were treated at hospitals. There were 297 passengers and 12 crew onboard.Speaking at a press conference, Steve Shaw of the Greater Toronto Airport Authority said "As far as we know at this stage the passengers were able to flee the aircraft before the fire broke out."The plane, flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, apparently ran into trouble amidst severe thunderstorms that had caused take-offs to be suspended at the time of the crash.The plane skidded 200 m past the end of the runway, through barriers and into the wooded Etobicoke Creek ravine near Highway 401, then burst into flames. The runway was recently constructed, and is the shortest at the airport (9000 feet).The last major crash of an airliner in North America was American Airlines Flight 587.  There has never been a fatality in the 14 years since the Airbus A340 first flew.The wreckage of a crashed plane carrying by various reports 33 or 34 occupants has been found in Namibia but none of its passengers or crew survived, police in the country said yesterday. LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470 took off from the Mozambique capital's airport at 11:26 CAT (0926 UTC) Friday and was scheduled to reach an airport in Luanda, the capital of Angola, at 14:10 WAT (1310 UTC).The remains of the plane were discovered at Bwabwata National Park in Namibia, close to the borders between Angola and Botswana. Kavango Region police coordinator Willie Bampton reportedly said yesterday: "My team on the ground have found the wreckage. No survivors. The plane is totally burned". A nearby game ranger with the surname Shinonge described bodies being "scattered all over the place", adding, "It's a horrible sight". Shinonge also said investigators managed to find and recover the aircraft's black boxes.In the immediate aftermath of the incident, when the aircraft's exact location was unknown, LAM Mozambique Airlines stated: "Information obtained indicates that the flight has landed in a location in Northern Namibia, bordering Angola and Botswana near a place called Rundu." However, the airline later confirmed the plane had in fact crashed. "At this time, our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew who were on board the aircraft. LAM has established family assistance centres at Maputo and Luanda airports to support the families who are naturally distressed", a further statement from the company said. Authorities from Namibia, Angola, Botswana, and South Africa were thanked by the airline for their assistance in the search for the plane.The plane reportedly had a crew of six and 27 or 28 passengers. Ten of the passengers were Mozambique nationals, while nine were from Angola and five were from Portugal. One passenger from each of France, Brazil and China were also onboard.The exact cause of the crash is unknown, although officials in Mozambique said weather and visibility were poor on Friday. In a statement, LAM Mozambique Airlines said: "We do not have any information on the circumstances of the accident and we cannot speculate on possible causes as the investigators must be given the time and space to do their work without interference or prejudice."A 29-year-old woman is dead after she fell from the roof of a University of Toronto building, apparently seeking ghosts.The deceased, which some reports say was Leah Kubik, was exploring a building at 1 Spadina Crescent with a male companion around 2:00 a.m. (EDT). She attempted to make a jump from one section of the building to another and missed, resulting in a three-story fall into a courtyard below. Kubik was taken to St Michael's Hospital in Toronto where doctors pronounced her dead.According to the Toronto Star, the pair had been drinking alcohol. Police initially said the two were hunting ghosts, but now say the two had finished a first date and were walking home when they decided to explore the building. An investigation is ongoing.The building, built for Knox College in 1874, was purchased by the University 37 years ago.An aging McDonnell Douglas MD-83 passenger jet (registration: SU-BOY) of Egypt's AMC Airlines with 156 passengers and seven crew on a charter flight made an emergency belly landing at the Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, Turkey after requesting permission to perform an emergency landing for technical reasons. The plane was returning vacationers to Poland from Hurghada and was bound for Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport.  The plane caught fire while belly landing and overshot the runway. One person was hurt. There were no fatalities. The plane is likely a total loss. The Norwegian pilot said that the landing, which was made in darkness, was possible because of speckless sky at the time.American Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman is in reported to be in serious condition but good spirits in a Tennessee hospital following a single car accident in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi in the Mississippi Delta. The 71-year-old actor was flown to the hospital by air ambulance with injuries to one arm.Freeman, the Associated Press reports, "has a broken arm, broken elbow and minor shoulder damage, but is in good spirits," according to a statement from Donna Lee, Freeman's publicist.Reports say that Freeman was driving Demaris Meyer — the owner of the 1997 Nissan Maxima — when the car flipped over two or three times around 11:30 p.m. Sunday night. Meyer's condition has not been released. Meyers is reported to be a 48 year old family friend visiting from Memphis.According to reports, Freeman over-corrected the vehicle when he may have dozed and began to go off the highway, causing the car to flip two or three times before landing in a ditch. The accident occurred on Highway 32 just north of Ruleville, Mississippi not far from where Freeman currently resides.Clay McFerrin, editor of the Sun Sentinel in Charleston, told the Associated Press he arrived at the accident scene soon after the accident. "They had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle," McFerrin told the Associated Press. "He was lucid, conscious. He was talking, joking with some of the rescue workers at one point."Freeman was one of the stars of the recent film The Dark Knight and is currently being treated at Memphis Regional Medical Center along with Meyer. Spokeswoman Kathy Stringer says that "Freeman is in a serious condition," but did not comment further. The hospital, known locally as "The Med" is an acute care facility for up to 150 patients.According to Sgt. Ben Williams of the Mississippi Highway Patrol, "there's no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved" in causing the accident. He also said that both Freeman and Meyer were wearing their safety belts.An American Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-80 carrying 142 people was forced to return to Lambert-St. Louis International Airport after an engine caught fire shortly after takeoff. Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) personnel doused down the number one engine upon landing with foam.American Airlines Flight 140 had departed the airport at 1:03 p.m. on a scheduled domestic passenger flight to Chicago, but had developed the fire, coming back to land at 1:40 p.m. The aircraft was stopped on the runway, where it was met by ARFF crews, who extinguished the fire. None of the 137 passengers, three cabin crew and two pilots were injured, and they subsequently walked to the terminal.American Airlines have stated that their maintenance department will investigate the accident in an attempt to determine what sparked the fire. Federal inspectors from the National Transportation Safety Board will also investigate the accident, with at least two investigators dispatched, including a specialist in jet engines.An American Airlines (AA) plane made a safe emergency landing after it was diverted to Miami, Florida after the pilot reported that there was a problem with the plane's front landing gear.The plane, an McDonnell Douglas MD-80/MD-90 flight 862, took off just before 2:00 p.m. (eastern time) from Palm Beach International Airport and was en route to Chicago, Illinois when the problem was reported just after takeoff. It circled above Miami International Airport to burn off fuel and made a safe and uneventful emergency landing.The plane made a flyby of the airport's tower where officials could make a visual observation. The front gear appeared to be slightly bent in live footage shown by the Fox News Channel.None of the 138 people on board the plane were injured.An American Airlines jetliner has overshot the runway at the airport in the Jamaican capital Kingston injuring at least 40 people.The Boeing 737-800 jet overran the runway at Norman Manley International Airport late Tuesday as it was coming in for a landing during a heavy rainstorm.  The plane went through a fence at the end of the runway and skidded over a roadway before coming to rest on a beach.  There were no reports of any fatalities. More than 150 people were on board the flight, flying as Flight 331, originated in Washington, D.C. at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with a stop at Miami International Airport in Florida before heading to Kingston.A spokesman for American Airlines says part of the plane's landing gear collapsed, and one engine on the right side came off the wing. The fuselage was split open and the jet came to rest metres from the Caribbean Sea.One passenger, Pilar Abaurrea, described the landing in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, saying, "All of a sudden, when it hit the ground, the plane was kind of bouncing, someone said the plane was skidding and there was panic." Abaurrea also noted that the flight had encountered turbulence so severe that the drinks service was suspended three times and then cancelled completely.An American man presumed to be dead after the 1976 Big Thompson Canyon flood has been found alive in Oklahoma City.Barb Anderson, a Big Thompson Canyon resident, was researching the flood victims and found Darrell Johnson, alive and well, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.Sixty-three-year-old funeral director Darrell Johnson told the Fort Collins Coloradoan on Friday that he didn't know he was on the victim list until Anderson told him last year. He was one of the six reported missing and the 144 killed, which has now been amended to 143.Johnson and his family were living in a Sleepy Hollow resort cabin in Estes Park, but decided to leave after staying for one night. A few hours later, the whole resort was washed away.People in American Samoa were given only eight minutes warning that a tsunami, which killed 32 people in the unincorporated territory, resulting from the 2009 Samoa earthquake, was approaching. A report published by the United States Congress admits that the warning was issued sixteen minutes after the 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Samoa. The tsunami killed nearly 200 people in American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga. The report, written by the National Research Council, describes the length of time between the earthquake and the initial tsunami warning being issued as "relatively long", and states that the standard time for such a warning to be issued to be around two minutes. The study also revealed that one third of tsunami sensors are not working at any given time.John Orcutt, a [seismologist and head of the committee that wrote the report, described the delay as a "major concern", but he also said that "a large number of people" in American Samoa "didn't understand and there were lives that were lost because people simply didn't take the action to get away from the shore when they felt this huge earthquake. People have to understand the signs of a tsunami and head to higher ground." The Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities, and the Government of American Samoa did not respond to e-mails regarding the news.While complaints about the 'miserly' generosity of the Bush Administration have surfaced in recent days, donations and actions at the grassroots level have quietly illustrated the concern and sympathy felt by ordinary Americans.On Monday of this week, Jan Egeland, the UN's chief of emergency relief, said that rich nations like the U.S. were being "stingy" by making small contributions. Egeland later recanted his statement, adding that America's contributions to Asia's tsunami relief was "one of the most generous pledges so far."The Bush administration has pledged $350 million in aid for the relief effort. Critics have been quick to compare this to the $177 million spent every day in Iraq to conduct war in that country. In comparison, there was a $500 million pledge made recently by the government of Japan.Independently of the government, individual Americans have been directly contributing money to aid organizations.  Amazon.com placed a link for the American Red Cross, collecting more than $8 million from 100,000 people as of Friday, December 31st.  12,000 donors have donated over $1.2 million to the Red Cross through Yahoo.com.Scores of International aid organizations are accepting donations for helping victims of the earthquake and tsunami.  Many major companies including Apple Computer, Microsoft, Cisco, eBay, Google, and AOL are helping enable donations through the web.In recent days, there has been a notable increase in nuclear attack drill activities in LA, Houston and the state of South Carolina.Sources in the Houston Police Department have disclosed that they are running these nuclear disaster drills across the city of Houston, Texas."In the last week I have multi-checked with sources of mine in the Houston Police Department and confirmed that HPD has been running nuclear disaster drills," said Capt. Eric May, as he warned of a possible nuclear attack that might occur in the Texas City or Houston metro area. Capt. Eric May also mentioned that a likely target could be the British Petroleum plant in Texas City, Texas.Local citizens have also noticed ongoing SWAT exercises involving numerous government agencies in the area, including Homeland Security, the HPD and the Pasadena Police Department."After leaving the Texas City police station, I noticed one thing really strange, as I counted at least 11 different types of official police and government vehicles parked in the police lot. I have never seen this before and it has me a little worried. What are they planning?" said local resident John Watkins.Besides this increased activity in the Houston area, there have been reports that the Bank of America has been in contact with Homeland Security officials discussing the topic of how to deal with customers in the case of a pending "national disaster." Employees of the bank have been ordered to remain silent, as ones from all levels have been told of the proper procedures to take. Employees in both Houston and LA have disclosed they were recently told not to distribute certain things from safety deposit boxes in the event of a national emergency, including gold, silver and firearms. They were, however, allowed to hand out important papers to asking customers.It seems as if British Petroleum may also be conducting nuclear disaster exercises in the Houston area, as an email from an alleged BP employee has surfaced on the internet. Although his identity has not been proven as of yet, he states that he holds the position of a "building monitor" and has never had any responsibilities before. However, on Friday, January 27th, he was called into a meeting and told that he had best get his men ready for some disaster drills to be starting in the next week.The US government is also running a nuclear disaster drill in the Charleston, SC area from January 31st to February 2nd. The organizers said that nuclear drills should not frighten citizens, but should instead encourage them to learn how to protect themselves in the event of an attack. It should be noted that the government has run other nuclear disaster tests before, including one last summer called "Sudden Respond '05." Therefore, this increase of disaster drills may just indicate that the government is taking the threat of a nuclear attack seriously and not necessarily that there is one impending.An Amtrak train collided with a parked Norfolk Southern freight train in Chicago on Friday. 30 people were injured, five of them Amtrak personnel who were most seriously injured.Amtrak train 371, the Pere Marquette, started in Grand Rapids, Michigan and carried 193 people on board including six crew members. The train was in south Chicago heading towards its destination of Chicago Union Station when the crash occurred around 17:30 UTC. No injuries were reported among the crew of the Norfolk Southern freight train. Amtrak's locomotive, a GE Genesis, was derailed by the force of the impact, although the rest of the passenger train remained on the tracks.All Amtrak trains between Chicago and Michigan are currently cancelled while workers remove the locomotive from the scene and perform any needed repairs. A National Transportation Safety Board "Go Team" led by Ted Turpin was dispatched to the scene to conduct a federal investigation into the crash.As families fled their homes in the early morning hours on Thursday October 26, there was no warning. The Esperanza Fire southeast of Los Angeles and West of Palm Springs, California, had ballooned under the influence of Santa Ana winds to more than 19,000 acres as of the morning of October 27. No time to get the animals, no time for crates or even a leash. Sadly, owners left behind not only their horses, lamas, donkeys, chickens, rabbits, but also their dogs and cats.Many of the families who did manage to evacuate their pets found themselves in the parking lot at the Fellowship in the Pass Church Red Cross Shelter where a MuttShack Animal Rescue team caught up with them.Pam Anderson, Director of the emergency Red Cross shelter said that many people with animals had come and left.The air was thick with smoke, and ash was raining down on the parking lot where dog owners, not able to take their dogs into the shelter were camping out in pup tents andin their cars.Those who could afford it checked themselves into pet friendly hotels in nearby towns.Some were prepared. Jane Garner, a small dog breeder was able to get all her animals out, and had set up her puppy runs alongside her RV in the parking lot. Others were not doing too well, having left home without as much as a leash.The same scenario played out at the Red Cross shelter at Hemet High School. Animals were being boarded in vans, trailers and cars and small travel crates.When MuttShack Animal Rescue arrived, a small fracas had sent several dogs off in different directions, running out of the school parking lot down busy streets necessitating an instant rescue response.The Incident Command for the Esperanza Animals, Ramona Humane Society in San Jacinto welcomed MuttShack‘s offer to help at the shelters.Ramona Humane Society had recently published a notice in their Newsletter about the newly passed “PETS Act"and warned owners not wait until a major disaster such as an earthquake or fireto prepare. "Be proactive to ensure that your pet will be taken care of.”MuttShack and PetSmart Charities set up ad hoc facilities for the animals at both shelters.The Red Cross shelter, run by Madison Burtchaell of the Orange County Red Cross was very accommodating about allowing a small emergency pet shelter adjacent to the School.Barbara A. Fought of PetSmart Charities, an organization that works with animal welfare organizations and provide assistance in disasters, provided crates and emergency supplies.MuttShack and Red Cross volunteers, Martin St. John, Tom Hamilton, and Steve Meissner helped assemble the crates to secure a safe environment for evacuated pets.It was a great relief for evacuees who had camped out in the parking lot to finally leave their vehicles and relax at the shelter, setting up their cots to grab some sorely needed rest.Firefighters and residents reported loss of wildlife and animals. The Esperanza fire burned 34 homes, consumed 40,000 acres and cost five Firefighters their lives before it was contained four days later on October 30. Firefighting operations cost nearly $10 million.MuttShack Animal Rescue is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization active in disasters and dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and care of lost or discarded dogs, cats and other animals.Three anti-Olympic games protesters, posed as a flower delivery service, quickly ransacked British Columbia, Canada premier Gordon Campbell's downtown Vancouver, British Columbia office yesterday afternoon, breaking windows and throwing pictures, office documents, and various other items.After the suspects were caught, they said that they were upset over Campbell's support for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia. They also claimed to work for "The Anti-Poverty Committee".They are now facing charges for property damage and uttering threats during or after the incident. Police are only identifying them as a 23-year-old man, a 29-year-old man, and a 17-year old female. The 23-year-old faces a third charge of assault by trespassing.A pipeline rupture and fire at Apache Corporation's Varanus Island facility in Western Australia has reduced the supply of natural gas to Western Australia by 30%. 153 employees have been evacuated and 13 employees remain on the island to monitor the situation.Steven Farris, Apache's president and CEO said "No one was injured, all personnel are safe, and the rupture and fire appear to be contained on the island...At this time, we cannot estimate when throughput will be resumed." The facility was producing approximately 330 million cubic feet(MMcf) of natural gas and 8,000 barrels of crude oil per day, this has been reduced to 200 MMcf and 5,000 barrels per day.Western Australian Minister for Energy Fran Logan said that residential supplies were unlikely to be affected but has called on Western Australians to conserve the use of natural gas. Minister Logan said that Apache supplies primarily large volume users like Alinta Gas and Alcoa, and the major industrial users will be hit the hardest. The aluminum refineries owned by Alcoa, which are dependent on natural gas, have switched to diesel to maintain production.   Apache representatives, including its managing director Tim Wall and fire experts from Singapore, are heading to the site to extinguish the fire and assess the damage. Wall said during a news conference in Perth today that a small fire on a vent had already been extinguished. Apache has invoked a clause in its supply contracts to remove liability for unavoidable catastrophes that prevent them from fulfilling obligations under the contract.A blaze at an apartment block killed nine people early yesterday morning in Mississippi, US. The dead included six young children, and the building was seriously damaged after fire broke out at 4 a.m. in Starkville.All nine victims were in the same apartment in the two-story building, which was split into eight residences and sustained heavy damage to three of these. Firefighters had difficulty dealing with the emergency and were still there six hours after the fire began.The youngest child was six months old and the eldest was four. No names have been released, and the disaster's cause remains a mystery. Emergency services kept residents away while they cleaned up the scene.A 50-year-old man has been killed as a result of an apartment fire in south London, England.The fire department were called at around 2335 GMT on Saturday to a fire in a four-bedroom property on Ely Road in Croydon. Reports indicate three fire trucks and fifteen firemen at the scene of the incident; using breathing apparatus, the fire crew were able to rescue the man from the building. He was taken to a hospital however, doctors were unable to save the man. He later died as a result of the smoke inhalation. The deceased's next of kin have been notified.The time taken to extinguish the fire was less than 30 minutes. It is estimated that 5% of damage was caused to the property as a result of the fire. An investigation is now being held into the fire, however the death of the man is not being treated as suspicious.A spokesperson for the police said, "[w]e were called to a fire at an address in Ely Road [on Saturday] evening. A 50-year-old man was taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation. He later died from his injuries."At least 27 people, including three children, have been killed and about twenty are still missing after a Wednesday gas explosion in an apartment building in the Ukrainian town of Yevpatoria, Crimea. Five injured are treated in local hospitals, one of them in a serious condition. According to Ukrainian Emergency Situations Ministry, the blast occurred at about 9:45 p.m local time on Wednesday, destroying 35 apartments of a five-storey post-Soviet block. The rescuers, in the number of 565, managed to pull out alive 21 residents of the building; about twenty people are still unaccounted for, the Ministry spokesmen said. The search was regularly suspended so the rescuers could hear voices of victims still trapped under the rubble, the AFP reports.Olexander Mazilin, head of the regional branch of the Emergency Situations Ministry, said that 26 out of 27 bodies have been identified so far. He told the journalists that entire families, including one family of five, were among the dead. Eduard Grivkovsky, the Crimea's deputy prime minister, told the reporters that there are likely more casualties, as the rescuers were working through the rubble of the third floor to get to the lower floors and basement. According to the outcome of the government experts, the blast was caused by a leak of oxygen; the gas is reported to have been stored in cylinders in the building's basement. Yulia Tymoshenko, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, however, told the journalists that a certain information about the content of the cylinders, which is to be oxygen or acetylene, will be revealed only when rescuers get to the basement. ""According to preliminary expert conclusions, there was a workshop in the building's basement where explosive materials have been used without any kind of permission," she said. The Ukrainian government has allocated UAH 70 million (about US$ 13.865 million) for work against the effects of the blast. According to the official website of the Prime Minister, the funds will be used to pay peculiarly compensations for lost properties and purchase temporary accommodations for the victims of the blast. Gas explosions are not rare in the post-Soviet and poorly maintained areas of Ukraine. In 2003 and 2007, such blasts happened in Dnipropetrovsk in the south-central region of the country. In 2003, ten buildings, including a nine-story apartment building, were destroyed after a series of gas blasts; the occurrence resulted in 23 victims. One year ago, a nine-story building was partially destroyed with 15 people dead.Two medical helicopters en route to Flagstaff Medical Center reportedly crashed into each other near Flagstaff Arizona, United States, leaving six of the seven passengers dead, and one, a nurse, seriously injured. At least one passenger of three on a Bell 407 helicopter operated by Air Methods Corp. was reported to be a patient. The other helicopter, also a Bell 407, operated by Classic Helicopters, Ltd., carried four passengers who are all dead except for one with serious injures. Spokesperson Matt Stein of Classic Helicopters said that the patient on board the helicopter they operated was being lifted from a medical emergency on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.The helicopters collided at about 3:45 pm PDT (22:45 UTC), according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and crashed about half a mile (800 metres) from the hospital. The helicopters crashed into a forested hillside, igniting a fire that burned about ten to fifteen acres (four to six hectares) of land, but was contained quickly by rescue workers.Two medical rescue workers were released from a hospital after an explosion of one of the helicopters on the ground. Reuters was told by Sergeant Tom Boughner that "They were treated for minor burns injuries and were released from the hospital in good condition".Flagstaff is a city near the centre of Arizona in the United States. The surrounding areas north-east, west, and south-west are lined with hillsides. The city is just south-east of the popular tourist attraction, the Grand Canyon.Classic Helicopters states that their pilot had over 10,000 hours of experience and this is the first fatal incident they've had. The FAA is performing an investigation of the incident.A huge fire set the Armando museum in Amersfoort, Netherlands in flames around 1:00pm (local time). The museum was having a special exhibition and had borrowed many paintings from other museums and individuals. The museum was being worked on by painters, though there is no evidence that that was the cause.Armando is a Dutch artist currently living in Germany. The collection of his work in the museum is estimated to have been worth roughly €3 million. The collection consisted mostly of paintings and statues.The people living near the museum had been evacuated in case the fire spread beyond the buildings which had already caught fire. They were able to spend the night in the local city hall.Armenia's president Robert Kocharyan expressed his condolences Wednesday morning to friends and families who lost their loved ones in the air crash over the Black Sea.Early Wednesday morning, an Armenian Airbus A-320 flying from the capital of Armenia, Yerevan, to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi crashed with the loss of all 113 passengers and crew."I was deeply grieved to learn about the air crash," President Kocharyan said. "I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the passengers and the crew. I assure that the families of those who died will receive the necessary assistance, and the authorities will make every effort to discover the causes of the accident."The Russian and Armenian presidents have also announced on Wednesday that Friday, May 5th, would be a day of mourning in remembrance of the 113 people that died in the air crash.Russian emergency services said the airliner had crashed at about six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the coast while approaching land in stormy weather.Ernest Krajniak from Chilton, Wisconsin in the United States has been charged with arson after a lit cigarette ignited gasoline soaked clothes, setting his apartment ablaze.On Friday April 3, Krajniak, 47, cleaned his entire apartment with about five gallons of gasoline, wiping everything down with the soaked clothes. After he was finished, he piled the soaked clothes in the center of his bedroom, lit a cigarette and then threw what was left of the still lit cigarette, into the pile.Krajniak never called the fire department and never pulled the alarm. Instead he yelled 'fire' a few times then walked to the police station where an ambulance took him to a local hospital for the treatment of minor burns. The fire department later arrived to put out the blaze and his apartment was extensively smoke damaged. 11 other apartments were also damaged, leaving the occupants without a place to stay for at least a week."I should have never used that," said Krajniak during a court appearance on Monday. He admitted to knowing that gasoline was highly flammable. He was arrested and his bond has been set a US$2,500. Krajniak's next court appearance is scheduled for Monday, April 13. According to WISinfo.com, Krajniak has no prior criminal record.The careless smoking of cigarettes has been blamed for thousands of fires across the U.S.  In January 2008, an unnamed elderly woman in Buffalo, New York was receiving oxygen for medical problems in her home and lit a cigarette and began to smoke it.  The oxygen coming from her mask then facilitated the ignition of her clothing, setting her on fire.In the U.S. in 2002, only 4% of all residential fires were reportedly caused by smoking materials. These fires, however, were responsible for 19% of residential fire fatalities and 9% of injuries. The fatality rate due to smoking is nearly four times higher than the overall residential fire rate; injuries are more than twice as likely. Forty percent of all smoking fires start in the bedroom or living room/family room; in 35% of these fires, bedding or upholstered furniture are the items first ignited.Around 8:50 p.m. Korean Standard Time (11:50 UTC) on Sunday, a fire broke out at Sungnyemun Gate (more commonly referred to as Namdaemun Gate), one of the most iconic South Korean landmarks, located in the center of Seoul.Approximately 30 firetrucks and 90 firefighters were sent to the site and were able to bring the initial blaze under control by around 10:30 p.m. However, around 10:40 p.m., the fire rekindled at the second floor of the gate, as firefighters were in the process of extinguishing embers. By 11:00 p.m. the fire had spread over to the roof of the gate. The Korean Fire Department reports that the second blaze had started as the Department was seeking permission from the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration to dismantle parts of the gate in order to stop any possible further fires from spreading. At about 12:40 a.m. of the 11th, the second floor had collapsed, and the fire was spreading to the first floor; at 1:50 a.m. the first floor collapsed.Officials have yet to reach a conclusion on the origin of fire, and have presented three possibilities; arson, electric faults or accidental origins.As the interior of the second floor of the Gate is off-limits to civilians, the Korean Fire Department initially eliminated the possibility of arson, and stated that an electric short or spark from the electric lighting could have been the cause. This possibility was later discarded as a firefighter reported, after examination, that there was no electric wiring on the second floor, as Korean Cultural Heritage Administration regulations prohibit it.Three eye-witnesses have submitted testimonies. A taxi driver has reported seeing a man in his fifties climb up the staircase carrying a shopping bag, shortly after seeing sparks. Police have stated that the driver's testimony differs in several crucial factors from the other two witnesses. Firefighters have reported finding two cigarette lighters on the second floor, inceasing the possibility of arson as the cause.Police have been unable to obtain evidence from the four closed circuit televisions(CCTVs) installed around the gate.Officials of the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration have stated that restoration will take two to three years and will cost 20 billion won, equivalent of 21 million USD. Officials report that no sprinklers or fire alarms were installed inside the gate, and only eight fire extinguishers were placed on both the first and second floor.Namdaemun, built during the Joseon Dynasty, is the oldest wooden structure in Seoul and was entitled 'National Treasure No. 1' in 1962 after restoration.In recent years, arsons started by evangelical Christians have damaged many Buddhist temples and Korean momuments.The arsonist responsible for setting fire to the historic Sungnyemun gate (more commonly referred to as Namdaemun gate) in Seoul, South Korea in February has been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The 600-year-old landmark was considred one of the nation's greatest and most iconic, with some sources describing it as the single most important one in the country.The 69-year-old male defendant has a previous conviction from two years ago for attempting to torch the Changgyeong palace, for which he received a suspended prison sentence and was fined. It is understood he destroyed the Namdaemun gate and attacked the palace over an unconnected land ownership dispute which had angered him. He felt that the compulsory purchase of his home a decade ago had been inadequatly compensated for by the state.After the fire, residents left flowers at the scene and wrote grieving notes.Chae Jong-Gi, who admitted the crime, was told of the seriousness of the offence in a statement by the Seoul district court. "A heavy sentence is inevitable as the accused inflicted unbearable agony on the people and damaged national pride... (The monument was) the treasure among all treasures which had survived all kinds of historic disasters. Even if restored, the gate's originality will never return. Therefore, the nature and consequences of this crime are very serious," said the statement.The man is thought to have selected the gate as a target due to lax security measures. In the fire's aftermath, officials have been criticised over this and concerns that firefighting efforts were ineffective, and the Cultural Heritage Administration's chief resigned to show he accepted responsibility for the blaze.The two storey gate in pagoda style was constructed in 1398 and despite a 1447 rebuild and multiple renovations still contained original timbers prior to the destruction in the fire. Only the stone base survived.According to the Cultural Heritage Administration, a reconstruction effort will take two to three years and cost 20 billion won (US$21 million).Arung Samudera, the Indonesian naval tall ship that was recently grounded off Queensland, Australia, has been salvaged from the beach at Inskip Point and is currently being towed to Brisbane for repairs.The 35m vessel has been stranded since last Thursday, when she was grounded whilst on her way to the APEC meeting in Sydney. The ship is expected to berth in Brisbane near the naval barracks at approximately 11 a.m. (AEST). The tri-masted sailing training vessel, built in New Zealand, is believed to be seaworthy, but has serious damage to her keel and rudder. After the completion of repairs, the ship is expected to continue to Sydney, although it will not reach it in time for the APEC meeting.The ship's 18-man crew are said to be "very happy" with developments. According to the Australian Navy's Commander Forbes Peters, Indonesian officials are as pleased as the ships crew, with Peters saying "The naval attache and the first secretary to the ambassador are on site here and they cuddled Lieutenant Commander Larry Cook. They are over the moon and I'm sure the commanding officer is as well, even though he's currently at sea on his ship."The Christchurch Mail Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, was evacuated Friday after employees refused to continue working due to exposure to heavy amounts of dust suspected to be asbestos. Tuam 2 Ltd, the company set to convert the 27-year-old Christchurch Mail Centre into a new city council building, has been aware of the presence of asbestos in the building since May 2008. Hawkins Construction contacted the New Zealand Department of Labour, voicing concerns of possible exposure to asbestos material. Testing is currently underway at the facility to determine the nature of the exposure.The Christchurch Mail Centre is operated by New Zealand Post. According to Christchurch Delivery Business Leader Duncan Burman, approximately 50 post workers operate out of the facility, which services about 35,000 addresses in the central Christchurch region.According to a paper released in June by the Environment Canterbury on the subject of asbestos removal: "Exposure can occur when materials containing asbestos are sanded, sawn, drilled or handled in maintenance or removal tasks." Exposure to asbestos fibers can lead to the diseases mesothelioma, lung cancer, chest cancer, and asbestosis. Tony Marryatt, chief executive of the city council, was asked by Councillor Helen Broughton for an explanation of the incident. Councillor Broughton is the only councillor who voted against construction of new city council buildings. "Councillors made an assumption that the building had been checked by a professional and that's the question I'm going to ask the CEO now. I've asked him for a report on it and I want to see the professional opinion from a building consultant who said that the building was sound and able to be refitted and didn't have any major problems," said Broughton in a statement in The Press.The owners of the Christchurch Mail Centre informed New Zealand Post that testing performed in November confirmed there was no asbestos "in the area". Anna Kenny, a spokesperson for the New Zealand trade union Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union said concerns were raised about plumes of dust Friday morning suspected to be asbestos, but that there has been no confirmation of this yet. According to The Press, Kenny also confirmed that no asbestos was found in a check of the building in November. "Having said that, however, given that the dust is particularly unpleasant and unsafe and of an unknown source, we've asked for further air quality checks to be done before people go back in to that environment and we also want the hazard eliminated," stated Kenny.Torrential monsoon rains for the past 11 days have inundated parts of Southeast Asia, heavily flooding areas of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh and affecting over 20 million people. An estimated 1,400 have been killed across the region, as waterborne diseases have proliferated and become highly virulent in the humid and wet conditions. The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, is currently providing relief to affected areas.An Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 airplane crashed upon landing at San Francisco International Airport around 11:30 AM local time today. Flight #214, coming from Seoul, carrying 291 passengers — including one infant, and 16 crew members — crashed on runway 28L. Two deaths are reported and 10 passengers were taken to San Francisco General Hospital critically injured. In total, officials report 181 people were hospitalized and one person remains unaccounted for. It is reported that when the airplane took off from Seoul, smoke was coming from the airplane.  The weather was good as the plane was landing in San Francisco. According to David Eun, a passenger on the airplane and the executive vice president of Samsung, the tail came off of the plane upon landing.  A non-passenger witness, Anthony Castorani, has reported that a fireball formed upon the plane landing and that the plane flipped over. A large portion of the passenger area of the plane was on fire and has burned out. Most of the plane's tail is gone. Passengers were seen using emergency slides to escape the wreckage. The cause of the crash is is unknown. There have been no reports stating that the airplane pilot made distress calls before the accident. Law enforcement does not believe the accident was the result of terrorism or criminal activity. The National Transportation Safety Board will be investigating the crash. Deborah Hersman will lead the investigation.The airport was closed to all incoming and outgoing air and vehicle traffic until 3:30 PM local time, when it opened 2 runways. Over 330 flights were canceled at the airport. More than 70 flights headed to San Francisco were not allowed to land at the airport and were sent to other cities. Some flights have been diverted to Sacramento International Airport and Delta Air Lines has canceled 10 flights to and from San Francisco. United Airlines and Virgin America offered passengers the opportunity to change the flights at no extra cost until Monday. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook Chief Operating Officer, was supposed to travel on the Asiana flight. She rescheduled, along with colleagues, her flight to fly on United Airlines instead. Her flight landed 20 minutes before the Asiana crash.A Boeing 777 can hold as many as 300 passengers. Asiana is the second largest airline in South Korea.At least 10,000 people are dead and another 3,000 are missing after Cyclone Nargis hit the country of Myanmar, according to Foreign Minister Nyan Win, who spoke on state television. Just hours later Xinhua News Agency reported that government officials had told them that 15,000 were dead.The United Nations (UN) calls the report "alarming". Paul Risley, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme said, "The UN will begin preparing assistance now to be delivered and transported to Myanmar as quickly as possible.""The UN will do whatever it can to provide urgent humanitarian assistance. Because of the lack of communications, we are not quite sure what will be the total extent of damages and casualties. I am very much alarmed by incoming views that casualties have risen to more than 10,000, according to Myanmar's foreign ministry," said the Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon.The death toll has risen from Sunday's count of only 351 deaths.Food and water has become scarce and hundreds of thousands of people are homeless with several towns being completely destroyed. In the city of Yangon, there is no power and much of the drinking water has been contaminated."What is clear is that we are dealing with a major emergency situation, and the priority needs now are shelter and clean drinking water," said United Nations disaster response spokesman, Richard Horsey.There are 47.8 million people living in Myanmar with over 5 million in Yangon.A storm yesterday caused a crane to fall into Mecca's Grand Mosque, killing 107 or more and wounding 238, according to Saudi Arabia's Civil Defense Authority.Civil Defense Authority director General Suleiman al-Amr, in remarks to al-Ikhbariya television, said "All those who were wounded and the dead have been taken to hospital. There are no casualties left at the location".The accident, which occurred yesterday afternoon, was caused by strong winds and heavy rain that led the crane to fall. Photos released of the scene showed numerous bloodied bodies and various scattered debris.The accident occurred at a time when the mosque was relatively uncrowded. "Had it happened an hour later it would have been much worse," Khaled Al-Maeena, editor at large at the Saudi Gazette, said. "Had it happened five hours earlier or four hours earlier, I think the death toll would have been more than a thousand."The crane accident comes just ten days before the beginning of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest site. As undergoing a pilgrimage to Mecca is a mandatory religious duty for all Muslims who physically and financially can, millions of pilgrims arrive in Mecca each year for the Hajj. Construction was underway at the mosque in order to enlarge the mosque and improve crowd control, which has been a recurring problem during Mecca's pilgrimages.Police officials have said that at least fifteen people have died after the sightseeing boat Ilinden, with 50 Bulgarian tourists on board, sank in a lake in western Macedonia.The boat sank in Lake Ohrid, one of the deepest lakes in southeastern Europe.53 people were rescued by emergency crews. Witness reports suggest the boat split in half at around 11.00 local time (09.00 UTC) when it was 200 metres from the shore."A police diving team is on the scene, and we fear more people have drowned," said police spokesman Ivo Kotevski.The boat was reportedly headed from the city of Ohrid on the eastern shore of the lake to the Sveti Naum monastery, located close to the border with Albania.It is still uncertain what caused the boat to sink.At least 160 people were killed on Thursday after torrential rains caused mudslides in the Philippines.This is the latest in a series of storms that have hit the country, beginning on September 26, causing the worst flooding seen in the Philippines for four decades. Over 450 people in total have been killed due to the storms.Most of the casualties from the mudslides were in the Benguet and Mountain provinces, located on the Cordillera mountain range around two hundred kilometres north of the capital Manila.The rains also caused flooding in several dozen towns in the province of Pangasinan, and caused some dams to overflow with water.Rescue efforts were hampered because roads were blocked off by mud. Helicopters could not fly in the area due to inclement weather, and rescue teams had to travel by foot to reach affected areas."We are focused on rescue at this time. It is raining nonstop in the Cordilleras," said the spokesman for the government's disaster-relief agency, Lieutenant-Colonel Ernesto Torres.At least 21 miners in China are dead after an explosion at a coal mine in the southwestern Guizhou province earlier today, according to reports.The incident occurred at the Yuanyang mines in the city of Anshun. According to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, there were ten other workers in the mine who were rescued. It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, although it is being investigated, Xinhua reports. The colliery is operated by the government of the local township.A rescue worker present at the scene says five of the survivors were hospitalised due to carbon monoxide inhalation. "We arrived at the mine to carry out the rescue at midnight, and helped bring three of the survivors out of the shaft," he told Xinhua.Despite an initiative to increase the safety of collieries, Chinese mines are among the most dangerous in the world; official statistics say 2,631 workers died in 1,616 separate incidents last year, although the figure is down 18% from 2008.Two passenger trains collided in India early on Wednesday, killing at least 21 people and injuring more than twenty others, reports have said. The accident occurred at around 05.30 local time (00.00 UTC), when a passenger train collided with another train which was waiting at a red signal near the northern city of Agra.Both the trains were in the final leg of their journey at the time of the collision. They were heading to the capital, New Delhi, which is about 200 kilometers north of the accident site. Passengers said that they were sleeping when they felt a heavy jolt. One eyewitness told television crews that people on the upper berths of the train came tumbling down due to the impact:  "We felt a massive jolt. People sleeping on upper berths fell to the floor.""There was a loud bang and we were suddenly thrown out  of our seats. There was panic everywhere," another passenger recounted.A northern railway spokesman, R. D. Vajpayee, told the Voice of America news agency that the rear coach of the stationary train bore the brunt of the collision's impact. "We had to rescue, take out the passengers which were trapped in the last coach. And, gas cutters were used, and we had called the army also. They had assisted us and, within a few hours, we had completed with rescue operations."An unnamed eyewitness told the CNN-IBN news agency that "there are many people who are injured and many people who are dead. A lot of people fell onto the tracks because of the impact of the collision."Railway officials said they are not certain what caused the accident, but one of the trains may have overlooked a signal to stop. An inquiry into the incident has been ordered.Trains are the most popular mode of long-distance travel in India. India operates one of the most extensive and busiest rail networks in the world; 9,000 passenger trains run every day, carrying more than eighty million people daily across the country. There are about 300 rail accidents in the country every year, prompting calls for improving safety standards on the rail network. Earlier this month, one person was killed when a train derailed. In February, another train accident in eastern India claimed sixteen lives.Vietnamese officials have reported that at least 22 people were killed by Typhoon Ketsana, which brought torrential rainfalls and heavy flooding to the central areas of the country."According to our official count as of Tuesday afternoon from the local authorities, the typhoon killed 22 people," said an unnamed official from the country's national flood and storm committee.170,000 people were evacuated ahead of the typhoon, which brought peak winds of 90 miles per hour (144 kilometres per hour). Typhoon Ketsana had earlier battered the Philippines, killing over two hundred people there.Ketsana made landfall in the afternoon on Tuesday, 37 miles south of Danang, the National Weather Center reported.Flights departing and arriving at the Hue and Danang airports were cancelled due to inclement weather, and fishing boats were ordered to return to shore.Several of the casualties from the storm were due to falling trees and power lines. Truong Ngoc Nhi, the vice governor of the Quang Ngai province, south of Danang, said that "there's a blackout across our entire province. Streets are strewn with fallen trees and utility poles. It looks like a battlefield."Provincial disaster official Nhuyen Minh Tuan said that "the rivers are rising and many homes are flooded, and several mountainous districts have been isolated by mudslides."A train crash in Egypt killed at least 25 people on Saturday, officials said. Varying reports gave the number of injured between 24 and 55. Police officials have warned, however, that the true death toll might be much higher.The incident occurred in the village of Guerzah, near the city of Giza. Two passengers trains were travelling in the same direction on the same track, when the one in front made an unexpected stop, reportedly after driving over a cow. The train behind it, however, continued cruising at a normal speed until running into the back of the stopped train.A security official said to the Agence France-Presse news agency that "the trains were travelling on the same track. One ran into the other as they headed towards Upper Egypt."Tens of ambulances were dispatched to the scene of the accident. A crane was even used by rescue teams to lift a crushed wagon to try and find bodies underneath it.Railway accidents along Egypt's busy networks are not infrequent. At least twenty people were killed when a bus was hit by a train in northwestern Egypt in July of last year. In August 2006, 58 died and over a hundred were wounded after a train slammed into another one on the tracks. The country's worst rail disaster, however, was in February 2002, when at least 361 were killed after a passenger set fire to a moving train while using a stove.Three suicide bombers in the Iraqi city of Baquba, the capital of the Diyala Governorate, killed at least 29 people earlier today, according to reports, although the Associated Press puts the number at 32.According to Captain Ghalib al-Karkhi, the explosions targeted the provincial headquarters, a hospital, and the Iraqi army.One of the explosions occurred at the headquarters of police, the second near a police checkpoint; a third bomb blew up at the Baquba general hospital. A fourth bomb was later detonated by officials without incident about two hundred metres away from the hospital.Fakhri al-Obaidi, thespokesman of the Diyala provincial council in Baquba, commented on the incidents. "These attacks aim to terrify people from going to polling stations. But I am sure that people will insist on voting," as quoted by the Associated Press.Mahmoud Fadil, aged 50, was a witness to one of the bombings. "I saw others covered with blood lying on the ground and some crying because of wounds caused by shrapnel and the huge blast," he said, noting that the blast was strong enough to lift him up into the air.The attacks come several days before Iraqi parliamentary elections are due on March 7. The explosions were the deadliest bombings in the country since February 1, when a suicide bomber in Baghdad killed 54 people.At least 30 people have been killed and the death toll may rise further after a bus thought to be carrying 80 people fell 80 metres (262 feet) down a cliff in South Africa's mountainous KwaZulu-Natal province, coming to rest inverted in a river.Up to 32 more people have been hospitalised after the bus lost control due to a brake failure. The exact number of passengers, while thought to be 80, is unconfirmed at present as police have been unable to contact the vehicle's owner and the driver was killed in the disaster. The death toll could yet increase as police divers and military helicopters were still conducting search and rescue operations on the river and the wreck. Ambulances from across the Eastern Cape are at the scene.Four children are amongst the dead. It is unknown how many live passengers, if any, remain trapped in the wreckage of the bus, which crashed near Cedarville. It is also unclear how deeply underwater it is, with reports varying from half-submerged to one and a half metres below the waterline. Video footage from Sky News shows an overturned bus that is accessible to rescuers, suggesting either that the water is shallow or that the vehicle has already been dragged from the river.South Africa's death toll on roads is statistically among the world's worst, with 10,000 killed every year. It is unclear what caused the brakes to fail.At least 30 people have been killed by twin earthquakes in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Deputy Rwandan Police Chief Mary Gahonzire spoke to Reuters in Kigali, saying of a magnitude 5.0 to 6.0 quake that struck there "The death toll [in Rwanda] has now increased to 25 from the earthquake. Two hundred have serious injuries," while Bernard Watunakanza, acting governor of South Kivu's Bukavu region, said "Up to now, there are five dead and 149 seriously injured." This makes the total current death toll 30 and injury count 350.Radio Rwanda reports that ten of the Rwandan fatalities occurred together when a church collapsed onto them, killing them instantly. AFP reports the Rwandan ambulance service cannot cope with the casualties and public buses have been drafted in to help.The quake could also be felt in nearby Burundi, but there are no reports of damage or injuries there.At least 31 people have died and 35 more are missing after wooden passenger ferry Acita III sank off the coast of Sulawesi, Indonesia. At least 125 more have been rescued.The vessel capsized and sank at approximately 9 p.m. local time last night, going down near the port town of Bau Bau. It has been suggested that bad weather was the cause of the disaster, but Bau Bau mayor Amirul Tamin has told reporters that he believes overcrowding was a much more likely cause.An alternative explanation was offered by local police chief Mochammad Badrus, who says that the ship capsized after large numbers of passengers clambered onto an upper deck in attempts to gain mobile phone signals as the ferry neared land. Local residents and fisherman say they could hear people screaming for help as the accident unfolded.Passenger manifests are rare and usually inaccurate when they are available in Indonesia, so passenger numbers are unconfirmed, but the ship was thought to have been carrying 150 - 200 people. However, Tamin has said that the ferry should only have been carrying a maximum of 30 passengers.It is Indonesia's most serious ferry accident since the Levina 1 caught fire in February, which, in turn, came after MV Senopati Nusantara sank during a storm in late December.Heavy snowstorms in northern China have killed at least 32 people today, according to officials. More than 15,000 buildings had collapsed due to large amounts of snow and 300,000 hectares of winter crops were destroyed, according to the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs.The ministry estimated that 9.6 million people were affected in some way by the snows, and a further 166,000 people were evacuated from their homes. Most of the deaths were caused by traffic accidents, the ministry said.Heavy snowfall started on Monday in central and northern parts of China, including the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Shandong. The capital of Beijing was struck by three successive snowfalls, and dozens of flights at airports were cancelled or delayed. Beijing and the surrounding area is not very well equipped to handle the snows, as they have few de-icing supplies or snowploughs.The snowfalls are the heaviest in China since records started being kept in 1949, according to the civil affairs ministry. State media suggested some of the snowfall was started artificially, by cloud seeding.A spokesman for the Indonesian government has said that at least 38 people were killed following flash flooding in the North Sumatra province on Tuesday.The flood, which began in the early morning, struck the Mandailing Natal Regency, 275 kilometres from the provincial capital, Medan.The country's health ministry crisis centre leader, Rustam Pakaya, said the floods began at 2:00 local time (UTC+7) and soon reached a depth of two metres. Pakaya said that rescue efforts were hampered by muddy roads."Our latest information from the local district head is that 38 bodies have been found so far. Our main priority is to rescue the survivors. The flash floods hit six villages with about 2,200 residents," said spokesman Edy Sysopian to the Agence France-Presse news agency."The rescue process is difficult because the two bridges [...] to the villages collapsed. The other way to reach the affected area is by sea using speed boats, but strong weather [...] is making that difficult."Syamsul Arifin, the North Sumatra governor, said that fifty tonnes of rice were sent to the victims of the flooding out of government reserves.The governor said that "we have instructed the local social services office to provide food and assistance, including blankets and tents, while for the time being the health office is providing medicine."Pakistani officials have said that five attacks on government sites across the country have killed at least forty people. The latest attack occurred late on Thursday at a government residential area in Peshawar. Officials said they suspect Taliban militants for being responsible for the attacks. Authorities said that the situation in the eastern city of Lahore was under control, following separate attacks on the country's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and two police training centers.Gunmen with at least one suicide jacket stormed the FIA building at mid-morning. The FIA is an agency responsible for investigating matters relating to terrorism and immigration. Early last year, the building was the target of a suicide truck bomb that killed more than 20 people."Reportedly, four men attacked the FIA building and initial reports are that two of them have been killed," said the provincial interior secretary, Nadeem Hassan Asif Punjab.Soon after the assault on the FIA began, gunmen targeted two police training centers on the outskirts of Lahore. In the suburb of Manawa, gunmen targeted a center that militants attacked earlier this year. In the other incident, attackers with suicide jackets in Bedian climbed over a wall to gain access to the Elite Force Training Center. It took several hours before security forces were able to gain control of all the sites.The attacks in Pakistan's east took place hours after a suicide car bomber targeted a police station at a garrison town about an hour's drive from the northwestern city of Peshawar.Speaking to local media, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said intelligence agencies had expected attacks on security sites in the country and that authorities will remain on high-alert. He said the recent violence shows the militants want to bring the frontlines from Pakistan's violent northwest to Punjab province.On Saturday, militants with ties to Punjab, as well as the South Waziristan tribal region, assaulted the Pakistani army's headquarters in Rawalpindi.Pakistani intelligence officials believe the attacks are a reaction to the military's raids on South Waziristan. The military is expected to launch a full-scale assault on Taliban militants in the region bordering Afghanistan.Iraq's Interior Ministry reported that at least 41 people were killed and a further 68 wounded on Wednesday after two car bombings in the country's capital of Baghdad.Two explosions occurred within quarter of an hour of each other in the late afternoon in Sadr City. The bombings hit a restaurant and a flea market. A third vehicle in the area laden with bombs was discovered and defused without incident by police."I saw my blood covering the clothes that I had planned to take to my kids," said a witness to the incident, Saadi Rashid. "What a disaster when I felt that I couldn't bear to walk or even to stand."Sadr City is a predominantly Shiite Muslim-populated area located in Eastern Baghdad, and is home to about two and a half million people. It has been the target of a series of attacks by suspected Sunni insurgents. In November 2006, five car bombings killed 215 people in the city in one of the most deadly attacks in the ongoing war.The incidents occurred less than a week after a two-day span of bombings in the area killed 150 people. The attacks, which appear to be aimed at Shiite Muslims, have raised concerns that the Sunni insurgents are regrouping and have become stronger.According to Reuters, at least 443 are dead after massive flooding and mudslides in Brazil, after heavy rain in the rocky in the Serrana region.  msnbc.com has reported that the death toll stands at almost 500.  The area, located north of Rio de Janeiro, received 10 inches of rain (a month’s worth) in 24 hours.The Folha de São Paulo publication stated it was the worst natural disaster to impact Brazil in about forty years. During a 5 mile hike for supplies, local resident Vania Ramos said, “I don’t even have the words to describe what I’ve seen.”  According to the Civil Defense agency, in excess of 13,500 people have become homeless due to the recent events.Debris from destroyed houses is littered across the area; more rain and mudslides are expected. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff flew over the area by helicopter. To the region, the country's health ministry is sending seven thousand kilograms of medication. Teresopolis area mayor Jorge Mario said, “It’s like an earthquake struck some areas.”Few rescue workers have been able to assist the people in the affected area, as transportation to the area is difficult. States neighboring the area have also been impacted by heavy rain and mudslides; mudslides kill hundreds of Brazilians every year.In the early morning hours of today, according to police, a man by the name of Omar Mateen entered Pulse Nightclub, a gay club in Orlando, Florida, and opened fire. 50 people were killed and 53 were hospitalized.It is now the largest mass shooting in United States history, with the Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook Elementary shootings the closest behind. The shooter today used an automatic rifle according to one account; took hostages, and was eventually killed in a gun battle with SWAT units.Mateen's father, Mir Seddique, said in remarks to NBC News the attack was not about religion. The shooter allegedly called 911, the emergency phone number in the United States, and pledged his allegiance to ISIS. ISIS has claimed responsibility, according to a tweet from Reuters India. Reportedly, many have praised the attack on pro-ISIS forums.Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer has declared a state of emergency.According to Orlando Police Chief John Mina, "It appears [Omar Mateen] was organized and well-prepared"."It's just shocking [...] just one after another after another [...] It could have lasted a whole song", commented Christopher Hansen, who was getting a drink when gunshots rang out.China's Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday that at least 53 people were killed in Shanghai during a deadly fire. The blaze, which occurred on Monday at 2:15 p.m. CST (0615 UTC), consumed a 28-story high-rise apartment building in the city's Jing'an District.The building was being renovated at the time of the fire, and was home to over 150 families. At least 100 victims have been admitted to area hospitals, although some later died. Most survivors were not seriously injured, but needed treatment for smoke inhalation. Firefighters were still looking for survivors and over 70 were still hospitalized on the morning after the fire.The fire was the worst in recent Shanghai history and took over 100 fire engines more than four hours to contain. Strong winds blew heavy smoke into the air, hampering rescue efforts by helicopters. The smoke was seen by witnesses around 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) away from the high-rise. The fire was largely extinguished by 6:30 p.m. local time (1000 UTC), allowing fire and rescue officials to enter the building.The apartment building, built in the late 1990s, was home to mainly retired teachers. Some residents climbed down the scaffolding to escape, while others called for help but were unable to flee the blaze. "I saw at least four or five people hanging onto the scaffolding which covers the building, screaming for help," said Li Qubo, who was working near the high-rise.The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but local residents said fire safety regulations were not strict, and workers often tossed used cigarettes into the building's hallways. Qiu Jingshu, a 38-year-old worker who was outside the 18th floor when the fire struck, said he saw sparks from welding being done on an adjacent building fly over onto the high-rise. The sparks lit up foam on the scaffolding around the apartment, according to Qiu. "We had tried to put out the blaze, but the fire was so big and spread so quickly that we could barely escape ourselves," he said. Crews were said to have been installing insulation at the time of the fire, and witnesses saw construction materials on fire before the building was overtaken by flames.Two nearby buildings were evacuated, and their residents were temporarily sent to local hotels, and a school. Meng Jianzhu, China's Minister of Public Security, said that an investigation would determine who was responsible for the fire, so they could be punished accordingly. Meng said that a team had been formed under China's State Council to look into the disaster.A similar incident occurred in Beijing early last year. In February 2009, the illegal use of fireworks caused a fire that gutted a 34-story building under construction at the time.Shanghai has a population of about 20 million, housed mainly in high-rise apartments. Many buildings in the city are under construction or being renovated.File:Katrina damage.jpgThirty people died in the Gulf of Mexico resort of Biloxi when Hurricane Katrina demolished a water-side apartment block, Harrison County emergency operations center spokesman Jim Pollard told AP. However, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has yet to confirm the news.At least another twenty have died across the rest of Harrison County; this number is expected to rise. The Governor of the state of Mississippi has asked people to stay away from the area for several days. The towns of Biloxi and Gulfport took the brunt of the hurricane's 140mph+ winds after it veered away from New Orleans as it made landfall.Three more people have been killed by falling trees and at least two died in traffic accidents resulting from the hurricane. Hundreds of people have been rescued by boat and helicopter from the roofs of houses cut off by flood water.The hurricane has caused a storm-surge — the force of the winds has piled the waters of the Gulf of Mexico against the coastline, causing widespread flooding reaching at least a mile inland in places.A levee on the Lake Pontchartrain canal has broken in two places, causing massive flooding. Some parts of New Orleans are now under 20 feet of water. Flooding seems to have reduced to increasing at a rate of one inch an hour and Army Corps of Engineers are on the scene of the breaks. At aproximately 10:00 PM Central city officials confirmed that a major floodpump has failed, which could result in an additional nine feet of floodwaters.The western part of New Orleans has been flooded after a two-block long stretch of the 17th Street Levee gave way on Monday afternoon. Much of the city lies below sea level and depends on flood defences to keep it safe. One hospital — that has 1,000 patients inside — has been surrounded by the water. The vice-president of the center has described seeing whitecaps on the waves of the water in a street outside.A water main pipe has failed, meaning that tap water has been contaminated with flood water, and is no longer safe to drink.The mayor of the city has described seeing "bodies floating in the water."Some 10,000 people remain in the Superdome stadium, despite the electricity supply failing leaving the indoor stadium in darkness. The coverings of the concrete roof of the structure have been stripped away by the wind. Electricity supplies to 1.3 million people across the south eastern parts of the US have been damaged, and it could be months before power is restored to all affected.Two oil rigs have broken free of their moorings in the Gulf of Mexico, and a third drifted into a bridge in Mobile Bay, Alabama.Katrina has now been downgraded to tropical storm status as it moves northwards across the US, and wind speeds have dropped to 60mph. The current death toll does not include the 11 killed in Florida when Katrina struck there last week.At least 60 people died and several others were injured in a stampede at a temple in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. The incident occurred when the gates of a Hindu temple collapsed, according to police officials.At least 25 others were injured in the disaster. Some of them were said to be critical. The devotees had assembled at a religious feast or "bhandara" was organized by Jagadguru Kripalu Ji Maharaj in the Ram Janaki temple, located in the town of Kunda in Pratapgarh district. The lunch would have been followed by a free clothes distribution, according to sources. Over thousand had assembled in the temple for the luncheon without proper arrangement, according to Government sources.Sources say the stampede occurred when a temporary tin shed caved in and a gate of the temple collapsed. Over 30 people are trapped in the debris; rescue work by police and administrative officials is underway."Sixty bodies had been recovered and more could have been killed in the tragedy in Mangarh area of Pratapgarh district's Kunda town, about 180 km from here," said Brij Lal, Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order). According to Lal, the deaths and injuries occurred mainly due to the collapse of the gate."During the event the temple's concrete gate collapsed leaving 20 people dead and around 25 people injured. The accident did not have anything to do with stampede," said he. The death toll increased to 60 and is expected to surge even more.At least 65 people were killed and over 200 injured when a train derailed in West Bengal, India. Suspected Maoist rebels triggered the attack which occurred in the Howrah-Kurla Lokmanya Tilak Gyaneshwari Super Deluxe Express. The train, which runs from Kolkata to Mumbai, had thirteen coaches derailed, five of which were subsequently struck by a freight train coming in the opposite direction.The train derailed near the city of Sardiha, about 90 miles (150 km) southwest of the state capital of Kolkata. The region is a Maoist stronghold where multiple attacks have occurred in the recent past. The exact cause of the disaster was unclear, with some officials claiming an explosion had led to the attack, while some unaffected passengers stating they heard no blast. Police officials, including Bhupinder Singh, the head of police of the state, said the metallic parts which held parts of the rail track together were missing and labeled this as an act of sabotage. Singh blamed the Maoists for the attack stating policemen had found Maoist leaflets at the scene.However, the driver said he had heard an explosion in the attack which derailed as many as ten passenger coaches. The country's railways minister Mamata Bannerjee said the combined effect of sabotage to the tracks and a bomb blast led to the incident. According to her, there was "definitely sabotage" and the bomb blast had led to the derailment. "From whatever I have been told the apprehension is the Maoists were involved," she added. Police officials mentioned they were investigating whether the removal of the "fish plates" was the primary cause of the attack."The driver heard a loud noise which indicates there could be a blast. A detail investigation will reveal more, but definitely there was lot of tinkering done to the tracks," a senior railway official, Vivek Sahay, said.The incident occurred at around 1:30 a.m. local time, and police forces and local medics took an hour to rech the site. Lack of roads and the fear of an ambush by Maoists slowed rescue operations. Passengers complained of the slow operations; some of them claimed luggage and valuables were stolen in the confusion.E. Mitra, a doctor at the nearby Kharagpur Railway Hospital, noted 30 bodies had been taken to the hospital. But "a lot of dead bodies are strewn under the derailed carriages," he added. Home Secretary of the state, Samar Ghosh, said 65 bodies had been found till then.Air Force helicopters came to the scene at dawn as local television footage showed onlookers standing on the top of the affected carriages, as soldiers cut holes in the roofs with a gas-powered circular saw."People are crying. Rescuers are struggling to save the survivors and get the bodies out," Naresh Jana, a witness, said. "I can see body parts hanging out of the compartments and under the wheels. I can hear people, women, crying for help from inside the affected coaches.""There was a massive jerk, and we thought the Maoists had stopped the train to hijack it," another unidentified witness told local media. "But thank God it was an accident ... at least many people are saved. This area is very dangerous, very dangerous."The railways minister of India announced a compensation of $11,000 and a job in her ministry for the families of the dead and $2,200 for those wounded.The Maoists guerillas who are known as "Naxalites" in India are powerful force in Chhattisgarh, Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, which are the relatively poorer states of India. In the past few years, poor or landless peasants and tribesman have rendered their support towards the insurgents, due to the wealth gap and as a result of the former losing their land to government-aided mining companies.The Crandon, Wisconsin shooting occurred earlier today inside a home in northeastern Wisconsin and has left at least seven dead, including the gunman. Forest County Supervisor Tom Vollmar said, "It's a pretty tragic situation here... There are five or six people dead." WTMJ Newsradio told CNN that at least two of the dead are high school students.Ten youths were reportedly inside the house when the gunfire began.The shooter, Tyler Peterson, was killed by a police sniper after a manhunt.WITI-TV reports that one of the victims was a student at the Milwaukee Area Technical College.Crandon, Wisconsin, where the shooting occurred, has a population of nearly 2,000.The entire area was locked down, until recently, when police said they are no longer searching for any suspects. Crandon Police Chief John Dennee said, "We're not looking for anybody anymore." Crandon' Mayor, Gary Bradley, did not want to comment on the investigation, only saying, "We are going to get together and be strong...We are a strong community. We always have been. This is agonizing, but we will prevail."A mother of one of those fatally shot said, "I'm waiting for somebody to wake me up right now. This is a bad, bad dream...All I heard it was a jealous boyfriend and he went berserk. He took them all out." A neighbor who lives by the crime scene said, "I heard probably five or six shots, a short pause and then five or six more...I wasn't sure if it was gunfire initially. I thought some kids were messing around and hitting a nearby metal building."At least 706 passengers and 22 crew have been rescued after fire broke out on the top deck of an Indonesian passenger ferry. According to ABC News citing Sampit Police Chief Jihartono talking to ElShinta, at least 712 passengers and 57 crew were rescued.The boat was sailing from Surabaya, East Java to the port of Sampit, which is inland on the Mentaya river in Borneo. The ferry had reached the river and was near the town of Samuda when fire broke out.A number of boats were nearby at the time and were able to assist with rescue operations, as were residents on the river bank. It is believed that all on board were safely rescued, with four hospitalised and the rest in shelters at the riverside, but it is difficult to be sure because ferries often carry more passengers than manifestos suggest in Indonesia, where they are a major form of transport between the many islands that comprise the nation. Most of the passengers worked at local palm oil plantations.Harbour official Abdul Kadir told the press "The boat had no adequate fire-fighting equipment, so efforts were dedicated to rescuing the people on board," and said that transport officials and police have arrived at the scene. It took five hours to extuinguish the blaze, and an investigation will be conducted.According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, no less than 73 miners have been killed and a further 113 hospitalised after a gas blast in a coal mine in China on Sunday. The incident occurred before dawn in the mine in Gujiao City, located in the Shanxi province. 436 miners were underground in the mine at the time.Xinhua stated that 340 of the miners had been rescued following the explosion, 21 of which are reported to have sustained serious injuries.The mine belongs to the Shanxi Jiaomei Group, which is the country's largest producer of coking coal, and operates 28 mines.China's mining industry is the most dangerous in the world, with 3,200 fatalities recorded in 2008. The safety record is improving, however, as that figure is a 15 percent decrease over the previous year.A suicide bomber at a volleyball game in northwestern Pakistan detonated a vehicle full of explosives Friday, killing at least 75 people and injuring scores more. Some reports placed the number of dead as high as 88.The explosion occurred in the town of Lakki Marwat in the North West Frontier Province, located nearby to the South and North Waziristan provinces, an area where Pakistani Taliban members are known to be active.Reportedly, the attacker drove his car onto a volleyball field, where a game, being watched by many people, was being played."The locality has been a hub of militants. Locals set up a militia and expelled the militants from this area. This attack seems to be reaction to their expulsion," said, Ayub Khan, a local police chief, to media. According to him, the attacker's vehicle contained 250 kilograms of highly intensive explosive material.Buildings in the vicinity of the field, including a mosque were collapsed or damaged by the force of the blast. "[W]e fear that some ten or so people might have been trapped in the rubble", Khan said.Another security official, Khabib Khan, said that there were around three hundred people attending at the volleyball competition when the explosion happened. "We had security there. We had it for the meeting, and for the tournament," he said to the Associated Press news agency over the telephone.Malik Naveed, the provincial police chief, said to Voice of America that the attack may have been a retaliatory move against the residents of the town. According to him, the village where the attack occurred was once considered a hub of Taliban fighters; however, he says, locals, with the help of authorities set up a militia force and either killed or expelled them from their area."These insurgents, they were not very happy about it and they were cut off because the people had risen against them.  So this was one way of taking revenge from these people," Naveed said.This incident is the deadliest attack in Pakistan since October 28 of last year, when 112 people were killed by a car bomb in the city of Peshawar.A scheduled flight airliner belonging to Thai low-cost carrier One-Two-GO Airlines crashed and split in two on landing at Phuket International Airport in Thailand today. At least 89 people are dead and 41 injured, in the first major incident involving an airliner in Thailand's burgeoning low-cost aviation sector.One-Two-GO Airlines Flight OG 269, a MD-82 jet, had 123 passengers and seven crew members aboard. The plane was on a regularly scheduled flight from Bangkok's Don Mueang Airport to Phuket. It departed Bangkok at around 2:30 p.m. local time (0730 GMT) and reached Phuket at around 3:40 p.m. Upon landing, the plane skidded off the runway, crashed into some trees and burst into flames.There was heavy rain, strong winds, and visibility was poor, officials said. "The airplane asked to land but due to the weather in Phuket – strong wind and heavy rain – maybe the pilot did not see the runway clearly," civil aviation official Chiasak Angkauwan was quoted as saying.The airline's official website redirects to a web page listing the 42 injured passengers (one of whom has since died). Phuket (pronounced, roughly, "Poock-get") is a popular holiday destination for tourists."We sat on the 18th row. The weather was real bad and there were lots of unusual noises during the landing. Something was obviously wrong [during the landing]," a survivor identified as "John" was quoted as saying in The Nation.Another passenger, Nong Khaonual, told The Nation that he felt the plane had descended at an unusually high speed, and that it immediately caught fire after it skidded off the runway and came to rest in some trees. Nong said he was able to drag his wife from the plane. He said he and some other survivors were seated at the rear of the aircraft, where the impact of the crash was less severe.One-Two-GO is the domestic, low-cost subsidiary of Orient Thai Airlines, a small airline that operates a fleet of older Boeing 747 jumbo jets and some smaller MD-82 and MD-83 jets. One-Two-GO is one of several low-cost airlines that have started up in Thailand in recent years.At least eight people have died when a bus fell off a cliff in southern Albania. The bus crashed 300-feet off of the cliff during a rain storm during a journey from Tirana, Albania to Athens, Greece. Albanian Health Minister Petrit Vasili told media that 41 people are reported to have been injured, five of them seriously.Shkelqim Pashaj, a spokesman for the fire brigade, said that survivors have stated that the Greek-born driver had been talking on his mobile phone for the majority of the journey. Other survivors spoke to local journalists and asserted that he had been "driving erratically". An Albanian police statement has stated that the bus crashed over the cliff after the driver lost control.Both the Albanian and Greek police are involved in the situation. Around 100 emergency service officials were assisting in recovering victims from the crash site. The Greek police have released a statement saying that the bus belongs to a Greek long distance bus company. The crash is due to be investigated.At least eight construction workers have died and thirteen more are injured after a building collapsed during construction in Qiuzhigou Village, a suburb of China's Wuhan City. It is unclear how many more if any are trapped as the project's coordinator fled and is being sought by police.The collapse occurred at 5 p.m. local time yesterday and reduced the four-story structure to a five-metre pile of rubble. The building was a private residence and was illegal as authorities had not been informed of it. Its location in an area accessible only via narrow alleys is hampering search and rescue efforts as heavy equipment such as cranes is having difficulty reaching the scene.Around 100 rescuers continue to pick through the rubble in the rain. An investigation has been launched.At least eight people have died in a fire in a multi-storied office center, namely, in the office belonging to the Russian Savings Bank (Sberbank), in the Russian Pacific port city of Vladivostok, the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said Monday. A spokesman said that the blaze broke at about 12:00 local time (02:00 UTC) on the sixth floor of the building. Some of the victims died when they jumped out windows in an attempt to escape the flames. In addition to the fatalities, another 15 people were hospitalized with burns and injuries.According to firefighters, serious breaches of fire-safety regulations were partly to blame for the deaths. A door to the attic was locked and people could not escape through an emergency exit. The fire has been almost extinguished. A team of investigators led by the deputy prosecutor of the Maritime Territory, Sergei Luchaninov, is looking into how the fire started.According to reports, at least eighteen people were killed in Brazil in the past 24 hours, following heavy storms that led to mudslides and torrential rains.Most of the deaths occurred in the Rio de Janeiro area of the country, and the local Office of Civil Defense commented that more deaths are likely as the inclement weather continues. The deaths were caused mainly because some shanty-houses collapsed under rain or mud.In Baixada Fluminese, an area north of downtown Rio de Janeiro, about two hundred people fled their homes when three nearby rivers overflooded their banks. The storm is expected to continue through much of today, according to meteorologists.At least fifteen people have been killed as the result of a landslide which occurred in Indonesia on Tuesday. According to BBC News Online, at least sixteen were killed. It is thought that up to seventy people were killed as a result of the landslide, which occurred in a village near to the city of Bandung.At one point, villagers attempted to dig out surviving victims from the rocks and mud by using their bare hands, as rescue efforts were suspended temporarily due to heavy rain, before recommencing after lifting equipment arrived. At least sixteen dead bodies have been recovered by Wednesday. Roughly five hundred people are contributing to the search and rescue.Priyadi Kardono, spokesperson for the Disaster Management Agency, stated: "We've found fifteen bodies so far and estimate that there are up to 70 people still missing." He also commented that fifteen other people had been injured, of which two have been hospitalised.According to a government official, at least 26 people were killed in a stampede on Thursday at a historic mosque in the northwestern city of Timbuktu, Mali."There were 26 killed and 40 wounded," Oumar Sangare, the Internal Ministry spokesman, told Reuters. However, other news agency reports put the death toll as low as fifteen.An official, who requested to remain anonymous, said the accident could have begun as a result of renovation work on the Djingareyber mosque—which is made primarily of mud, and was built in the fourteenth century. Construction work blocked off some of the roads, and that could have been a factor in the incident. "The mosque is being renovated, financed by the Aga Khan, and the work is carried out by South African specialists," the official told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency."Because of these renovations, the passage on the north side of the mosque is closed off. On that side, to get through, the faithful found an improvised alleyway. But the alley couldn't take the number of people using it. So there was a stampede. Somebody shouted 'someone has died' and panic took over," the same official went on to say.Others have remarked that rescue services responded "very quickly" to the stampede, and helped the "many injured."The Xinhua news agency reports the stampede started when an elderly woman fell in one of the town streets near the city's main mosque, where a sermon was being conducted in front of a large crowd; a passersby then rushed to assist the woman, apparently disrupting the crowd's movement and causing the stampede."People were circling the mosque, a ritual at each Mouloud [the observance of the Prophet Mohammed's birthday] and there was a huge crowd build up," commented Mohamed Bandjougou, one of the witnesses to the event, to AFP by telephone. "There were at least fifteen dead. The bodies were taken to the morgue."Authorities warned the number of injured may actually be higher than reported, saying that "we cannot rule out the fact that the number of those injured will increase because some of them are still hiding in their homes instead of coming to the hospital."  A hospital source commented that some of the people hurt were in critical condition, and needed to be evacuated to the capital, Bamako, as soon as possible.The mosque's imam, who gave his name as Asseyuti, commented on the incident. "We're in mourning. What happened is a real trauma. We accept the will of God. He gives us life, he takes it away," he said.According to an official statement, Malian president Amandou Toumani Toure is traveling to Timbuktu from Bamako in light of the stampede.At least fifteen people have been killed and a further fifty injured after gunmen attacked the central bank in Iraq's capital of Baghdad earlier today.The attack began when several suicide bombers detonated their vests near the bank; then, gunmen clashed with police as they tried to storm the building. According to officials, most of the dead were bank employees.Some anonymous hospital sources conflicted with official reports, saying that the number of killed was as high as 26, with sixty wounded.Major General Qassim al-Moussawi, an Iraqi military spokesman, attributed the attack to al-Qaeda. He added, however, that no money was taken from the building, which contains large sums of US and Iraq money and gold deposits.The attack occurred a day before the new Iraqi parliament was due to convene for the first time.A deadly hotel bombing in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, has killed at least fifteen people, including three Somali Cabinet ministers, earlier today. Some reports say the death toll could be higher. The blast targeted a university graduation ceremony being attended by a number of government officials.The Shamo Hotel was hosting a graduation ceremony for Banadir University. Eyewitnesses reported that a suicide bomber gained access to the venue dressed as a woman, donning a full abaya and a veil. The attacker was wearing an explosive strapped to his torso, but was not patted down by security.The director of Median Hospital, Ali Yusuf, commented that "forty people with shrapnel wounds, including students and medical doctors, have been hospitalized today. Six people died at the hospital."Former Islamic Courts Union members at the scene identified the bomber, whose head and face had been completely shaven, as a member of al-Shabab, the ultra-conservative Islamist group believed to have links to al-Qaeda.Somali Health Minister Qamar Aden Ali, Education Minister Ahmed Abdullahi Waayeel, and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were killed in the attack on Hotel.  Abdulkadir Mohamed Osman, the Somali presidency's director of information, commented on the incident. "This is a national tragedy for the Somali people. The blast rocked inside the hotel, killing three ministers and wounding another one."Adow served as the foreign secretary of the insurgent Islamic Courts Union when it took power in 2006. The Somali minister for sports is also reported to be hospitalized and in critical condition.  Mohamed Mohamoud, an attending graduate of the ceremony, said that he personally saw the remains of the health minister on the ground, as well as the corpses of other government officials. "The situation has dramatically changed from happiness to heartbreak. I am really discouraged for my colleagues. They have been studying in such a horrific environment, and today they passed away without benefiting from their education. May Allah give them his paradise," Mohamoud said.Two journalists, a reporter for Radio Shabelle and a cameraman with al-Arabia TV, were also found dead from the explosion. The National Union of Somali Journalists has issued a statement condemning the attack and expressing outrage at the loss of their colleagues. Somalia is one of the world's most dangerous places for journalists to work.  Eight have been killed in Somalia since the beginning of 2009.Hotel Shamo is often chosen by government officials to host events and at one time was a popular lodging option for foreign journalists. Recently-released Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout and Australian photojournalist Nigel Brennan were staying at the hotel before their capture last year.The hotel security staff say that they were kicked out of the room prior to the ceremony, as government security officials wanted sole handling of the event. The government officials were attending the graduation of 43 students from the local Banadir University.   The official death toll from the blast is expected to continue to rise, with some reports indicating that more than 60 people have been found dead.  The attack is the latest in a string of incidents linking al-Shabab to common insurgent tactics used by Islamist terrorist groups in other parts of the world. Until recently, suicide bombings were an unusual practice in Somalia.In September, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for a bold attack on a meeting between government officials and the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, which killed 17 peacekeepers, including the top Burundian commander. Two vehicles containing explosives were given entry to the AMISOM base and subsequently blew up.The rebel group is battling for control of the war-ravaged nation against the Western-backed Transitional Federal Government, led by former Islamic insurgent Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. Rebel groups control much of southern and central Somalia, as well as significant portions of Mogadishu.The government is being bolstered by the continuing presence of the peacekeeping force composed of Ugandans and Burundians. The AMISOM forces are mandated with the protection of key city sites such as the airport, seaport, and presidential palace.Parts of Texas have been scorched by sweeping wildfires this week. Officials state that a wildfire which swept much of central Texas this week destroyed at least 1,400 homes and forced about 5,000 people to evacuate to safety. An official with the Texas Forestry Services told news sources on Thursday that much of that fire has been contained.Officials have speculated that this fire alone has destroyed more homes than any other wildfire on record in the state. Officials are welcoming dropping temperatures, stating this will increase their ability to fight the fires effectively. A converted DC-10 aircraft was recently made available to fire authorities, but cannot be used until Friday as workers still need to time to prepare on-board equipment.One of the two fatalities in the central part of the state has been identified as Michael Troy Farr, 49, who died at his home. Earlier in the week, a woman and her infant died in a related blaze that quickly engulfed their home located near the city of Gladewater, located in the eastern part of the state. On Thursday, officials warned that East Texas has become the center of wildfire activity in the state.At least 170 wildfires have ravaged much of the state over the past week. On Tuesday, a thick haze of smoke enveloped the city of Tyler for several hours, forcing school officials to cancel all outdoor sports activities. Since late 2010 the overall devastation of wildfires in the state is estimated to cost at least US$216 million (£136 million,€157.5 million) in firefighting expenses. The state's Lieutenant Governor, David Dewhurst, who is the acting governor in Governor Perry's absence, indicated he will ask the federal government to declare Texas a major disaster area. President Obama has also promised to provide needed assistance to local officials.Reports say that a roadside bomb or landmine blast has killed at least four United Nations peacekeepers from Spain and injured at least three to six other peacekeepers in the town of Khiam, Nabatieh Governorate in southern Lebanon.At least two UN armored vehicles were severely damaged by the blast and at least one of those vehicles was carrying a stock of ammunition which caused it to explode after the device detonated.It is not known who planted the device, but Hezbollah has stated that it is not responsible for the blast and condemns the attack."The attack hurts the people of the south and of Lebanon," said an unnamed Hezbollah official.It is estimated that there are 15,000 peacekeepers inside Lebanon.At least fourteen people have died after eating toxic sardines in Madagascar. The deaths occurred in the town of Toliara, with another similar situation happening 130 km (80.8 mi) away in Sakaraha. The sardines the victims ate belong to the Clupeidae family. As well as the dead, around 120 people have been taken ill after eating the fish according to officials.Dr Hery Raharisaina, Madagascar's fishing and aquatic resources minister, offered condolence to the families of the victims on behalf of the government. He added in his statement that the government would pay for the medical bills for those who are still hospitalized from the toxic fish and would also supply 100 mattresses to the city of Toliara, as the region's hospital is overcrowded.Samples of the sardines have been sent to health officials at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar in the capital city of Antananarivo. Incidents like this have happened before in which researchers have tracked the cause down to the fish eating poisonous seaweed. Madagascar has the third biggest coral system in the world.At least nine people have been killed after a wooden ferry caught fire and sank in Indonesia. The Usaha Baru was carrying 77 passengers and crew when fire broke out within sight of land.Eight are confirmed dead and a two-year-old boy is missing and presumed dead. It is thought that the others all escaped the ship, and 35 are hospitalised in Ambon and receiving treatment for burns. Many survivors were rescued by fishermen in the area.Local authorities say it appears those on board panicked after a fire broke out in the engine room, but it is difficult to know exactly what happened at this stage because the ship was extensively damaged by fire before sinking.Search and rescue operations for the missing child - one of four children and one teenager killed - are ongoing at the site, which is near the small village of Salahutu, from which many of the rescuers came. Almost all of the passengers were Muslims headed home to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.Ferry accidents are common in the island nation of Indonesia, where the fleet is largely old and overcrowded.At least nine people were killed and another 60 were injured after a tornado swept through the town of Greensburg, Kansas in the United States. The tornado, which meteorologists described as a 1.4 mile wide wedge tornado, came through at approximately 9:38 p.m. local time. It leveled about 95% of the town, including at least two schools and the town's hospital. The entire population of the town, around 1,500 people, has been evacuated.One of the few structures currently left standing, a tavern, has been turned into a makeshift morgue. Residents are currently being bussed to nearby hospitals or storm shelters for the night. More tornadoes can be expected Saturday; Greensburg is in the area which the Storm Prediction Center has listed as a high risk for tornadoes, something that is rarely done.A Russian military plane crashed today in the Pacific Ocean. At least nine are missing after the turboprop went down in the Strait of Tartary, which is located in the far east of the country.The Tupolev Tu-142 maritime reconnaissance/anti-submarine aircraft, which is based on the Tu-95 strategic bomber, was reported by RIA Novosti as carrying "at least nine people" according to an unnamed military source. The BBC asserted that there were eleven on board, but did not attribute the number to anyone.A Defense Ministry statement said the plane was lost from radar during a training exercise over the strait, which lies between the mainland and Sakhalin. Search and rescue is ongoing for the crew around the reported crash site.An object that may be the fuselage has been located in water 44 meters (144 feet) deep, according to one report. Russia's Pacific Fleet has ceased all flights while the accident is investigated.A suicide bomber has killed at least 19 people around a courthouse in the city of Peshawar, Pakistan.Witnesses said that the powerful explosion occurred during rush hour. Several security personnel and lawyers are among the victims, and doctors reported that some of those injured are in a critical condition."One policemen [sic] has been martyred and four injured in the attack," said a senior police official, Mohammad Karim Khan.Senior police officer Sahibzada Anis, speaking to reporters, said that the suicide bomber was on foot and detonated the device when security guards stopped him for a search at the main entrance. The blast damaged several cars parked nearby. "The attacker was on foot and blew himself when guards tried to search him at the gates of the court," he said.Thursday's suicide attack in Peshawar took place hours after missiles fired by a suspected American drone killed at least four suspected militants and wounded five others in the North Waziristan region, on the Afghan border. The area is a known stronghold of Afghan and al-Qaeda militants.Taliban insurgents have intensified attacks in the country — particularly in and around Peshawar — after the Pakistani army launched an offensive against militant bases in South Waziristan.  Officials said that since early last month more than 300 people have died in bombings and militant raids on government, civilian, and Western targets in the country.According to reports, at least one person has been killed and a further eighteen wounded after multiple grenade attacks in Kigali, the capital of the African country of Rwanda.The attacks occurred at a train station, restaurant, and building housing businesses. According to the Al Jazeera news agency, five of those hurt were in serious condition.A police spokesman commented that it was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attacks or whether they were coordinated. Spokesman Eric Kayiranga noted that "[t]here is a possibility of it being the FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda], or criminals, or an accident. It can be any of that. We can't confirm that for now." He did, however, confirm the death toll, saying: "There was one death and eighteen injuries."Kayiranga also reported that two people had been taken into custody following the incidents. "Two suspects were apprehended, they belong to the Interahamwe militia," he said to Agence France-Presse, referring to a militia of the Hutu ethnic group, considered responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide of Tutsis. "We are continuing the investigation and questioning the two suspects," the spokesman added.At least seven mountaineers have died while climbing K2, the second highest mountain in the world. The accident was reportedly caused by a rock slide or an avalanche that severed all the ropes used for ascent and descent. Initial reports state that seventeen climbers ascended the mountain in two groups, with both reaching the summit successfully. The reports also state that after the avalanche, some climbers attempted to return without ropes.The summit was covered in clouds late yesterday afternoon and the conditions in the mountain continued to deteriorate. Some of the latest reports indicate that eight climbers were stuck at the summit, unable to descend. Four of these climbers are Norwegian nationals. The conditions at the summit during night are extreme and offer very limited chances for survival for people unable to descend.In an unrelated incident, a Serbian climber and his sherpa fell down during the initial descent. This incident was, however, unrelated to the other deaths caused by the avalanche.According to reports, at least seventeen people have been killed in Somalia after clashes between opposition rebels and government troops, although some reports put the number as high as 24. 61 others were wounded.The violence started Wednesday in the capital, Mogadishu, when Islamist rebels started firing at the Villa Somalia, the presidential palace; guards from the African Union responded by firing mortars. According to Al Jazeera news agency, the rebels were stationed in the busy Bakara market."We admitted 61 wounded people from yesterday's shelling. Three of them died inside the hospital during treatment," commented a doctor at the Medina Hospital to the the German Press Agency DPA."The death toll may rise because we have not yet reached some of the districts where shells also landed," said the coordinator of the Mogadishu ambulance service, Ali Muse, to the Reuters news agency.Thousands of residents are said to have fled the capital this week, fearing more violence between the rebels and the transitional government; the former are in control of many parts of the capital.A bus accident in southern India has left at least thirty people dead — including about ten children — and thirty more injured, according to reports.  The incident occurred before dawn in the town of Chitradurga in the Karnataka state.  The vehicle, en route to Bangalore, about 200 kilometres from the scene of the accident, drove into a police barricade and flipped over, causing the fuel tank to explode and burn the passengers.The Press Trust of India news service reports that the driver was among the dead. Senior police officer Labhu Ram also noted that three of those hurt were in serious condition.Indian police sometimes set up barricades along roads to perform checks; however, some are not clearly marked and not easily discernible in darkness.At least twelve bodies have been recovered from the rubble of an apartment building in Alexandria, Egypt. Ten people were hospitalized after the four-storey structure, which was illegal, collapsed in at around 1:00 a.m. Tuesday. No survivors have been pulled out since an eleven year old girl was rescued this morning. Search and rescue operations hare scheduled to end tonight.The 53-year-old building was illegally modified in 1997 with the addition of two extra floors by owner Majdi al-Ishaqi. Two years ago, a court ordered the extra floors to be demolished but this never happened. Another subsequent order for renovations was also ignored. Structural alterations were demanded but never made."It was not in keeping with housing regulations. This is the third building to collapse in the district. The municipality cannot be exonerated," said Saleh Subhi of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood. "The building was already ready to collapse."Two neighbouring apartment blocks were also evacuated, one suffering a partial roof collapse. One survivor, Samih Nazmi, said he and his parents escaped their ground floor dwelling relatively unscathed as the ground floor remained largely intact. He also described a sound akin to that of an exploding gas canister as the building came down.Four days of torrential rains in Tanzania caused landslides on Tuesday, killing at least twenty people in a village, among them seven schoolchildren. More people are also reported missing.The regional commissioner for Kilimanjaro region, Monica Mbega, said to the Reuters news agency that twenty bodies were recovered from the village of Goha. She remarked that the torrential rains came after a period of prolonged drought."A landslide with a big chunk of mountain collapsed itself and came down and fell on about seven houses with about 32 families and about 25 people died. For these past two years there has been a drought, but for about four days there has been a lot of powerful rain," she said, noting that local residents think that there might be five more bodies to find.Rescue efforts in Goha are ongoing.According to local authorities, at least twenty people in Peru were killed by mudslides in a village in the northeastern part of the country on Friday.The incident occurred in the Ambo village, in the region of Huanuco. "As of 12:00 pm [17.00 GMT] [...] the death toll stands at twenty people," commented Hipolito Cruchaga, the Civil Defense chief of the region, to media.Cruchaga reported that fifty people were hurt by the mudslide, and put the number of missing persons at 25. However, other reports said as many as several hundred people were missing. According to local media, some dead bodies had been found and taken from the Huallaga River; other corpses were dug out of the mud.Jorge Espinoza, a senior official for Huanuco, remarked: "An entire village, some 400 people, has completely vanished. Some will be saved, but it appears the majority were buried."Authorities say the mudslide started when torrential rains caused a small lake on a mountain to overflow, spilling water into a ravine.At least two people have died and at least eight to ten were injured after two semi trucks collided in a truck tunnel on Interstate 5 (Newhall Pass) between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita California, United States, causing the tunnel to be completely shut down on both north and southbound lanes.At approximately 11:00 p.m. (pacific time), two semi trucks collided and at least 13 other trucks smashed into the wreckage causing a massive fire. Firefighters are using foam to control the flames, which could take several hours to put out.Officials say that the debris could take a day or more to remove and that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because officials say that the structure of the tunnel has been compromised."It has impacted the structural stability of the tunnel," said John Tripp the Fire Chief for Los Angeles County who also said that there may be more people trapped in the wreckage."We're going to have to do a very methodical search. There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape," added Tripp.The tunnel is 200 feet long.Tropical Storm Danielle is now a Category 1 hurricane, with winds up to 130 km/h (80 mph). The storm is headed towards Bermuda and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida expect it to strengthen over the next two days.  Hurricane Danielle is the second hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.North America is simultaneously threatened by Tropical Storm Frank.  The 80 km/h (50 mph) storm in the Pacific Ocean is about 210 km (130 miles) south-south west of Acapulco, Mexico. Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch in the area.Hurricane Danielle formed near the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa, being classified as Tropical Depression Six. It then developed into a more organized cyclone.Meteorologists predict that Danielle will be the first of several storms to form within the next two weeks, as the Atlantic hurricane season is currently at its peak. "There are signs that the Atlantic is acting like it should in August and September. We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season," said Rick Knabb of the Weather Channel.Even though the 2010 season seems to be one with low activity, emergency officials are still stressing safety and awareness to residents in hurricane-prone areas. "It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage," Lauren McKeague, Florida Division of Emergency Management, says. Hurricane Andrew was a catastrophic Category 5 storm that came during a year when it was a lower-than-average season.An attack on a mosque has killed at least 32 people, near Pakistan's military headquarters in the city of Rawalpindi. There have been conflicting accounts of the attack, but police reported gunfire and at least one explosion at the mosque soon after prayers on Friday morning. It is thought that one or more suicide bombers may have been involved.The attack took place at the Parade Lane mosque, in a part of the city containing several defence department buildings. Security workers cordoned off the scene while ambulances rushed to take victims to the hospital. "There was certainly more than one attacker, so there is a possibility that some of them may still be hiding in the vicinity," said Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the military.It is the latest in a series of attacks that have rocked Pakistan since the government launched an offensive against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in the northwest region bordering Afghanistan. On Thursday, a bomb blast at a police checkpoint wounded at least two policemen in the northwestern city of Peshawar.On Wednesday, a suicide bomber killed two guards and wounded eleven other people at naval headquarters in Pakistan's capital Islamabad. The same day, the military said troops killed fifteen suspected miltants, including a top militant commander, in the Swat Valley, the site of a major offensive earlier this year.A Russian trapeze artist, Vitaly Kharapavitski, 26, performing at a circus in Scariff, Ireland has died after a cage attached to a hot air balloon crushed the performer. His wife, Sasha, 24, who was also performing at the time, was injured, breaking her arm. Both were dressed in clown suits.At least 100 people were attending the circus and watched the acrobat fall. Most of the attendees were children.According to witnesses, the balloon caught fire and the cage fell on top of the acrobat, crushing his head.Spectators of the circus were asked to leave the area while the incident was being investigated. Tony Kenneally, a Garda Superintendent said that the incident is being treated as an accident."We had to discharge the audience because we knew it was quite serious," said spokespeople for the Royal Russian Circus.Some of the attendees thought the fall was part of the performance.Ron Cahill, a Canberra resident and chief coroner of the Australian Capital Territory, has concluded the inquest into the deaths of three Australian nationals who were amongst the 21 people killed in the crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200. The Boeing 737-400 aircraft overshot a runway at Yogyakarta, Indonesia on March 7.The inquest indicated that Alison Sudradjat, Brice Steele and Mark Scott died from injuries sustained in the crash. Cahill commented that this finding would also apply to the deaths of two other Australians on the flight; the remaining fatal injuries were sustained by Indonesians. The inquest was opened at the request of families of the three victims involved in this inquest after the repatriation of their bodies.Cahill agreed fully with a recent report issued by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, which indicated that the pilot-in-command attempted to land the aircraft at extreme speed despite 15 automated cockpit warnings and a request from the co-pilot to perform a go-around. He went on to suggest that the pilot should be prosecuted over his mistakes."I recommend that CASA and Air Services Australia and all Australian airlines review the report to consider whether any of the safety deficiencies identified have relevance to Australian aviation operations and therefore need to be addressed," he said.He went on to describe concerns with how these deficiencies are being addressed in Indonesia: "It is of some concern that the Indonesian regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, did not provide the National Transportation Safety Committee with details of safety action to address the recommendations which were in the draft report."Alison Sudrajat's daughter had this to say in light of the findings: "It was very informative and it was nice to know what exactly happened, because he went into quite some detail about everything." "It was quite comforting, but it's not going to bring anyone back."300 millimeters (11.8 inches) of rain fell in six hours resulting in flash flooding on the New South Wales mid-north coast in Australia trapping thousands."We're looking at a flood that is around the one in one hundred year flood level," said Phil Campbell, State Emergency Service spokesperson.Ambulance crews spent the night rescuing stranded residents caught off guard by the sudden deluge.As many as 2,700 residents had been trapped by the floodwaters. 420 people sought refuge in evacuation centres over night, of these all but 70 have returned home. The Red Cross flood evacuation centre in Urunga was left without power but still harbours 300 who sought refuge there.Inland floodwaters trapped more than 1,000 residents in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales over night."It does seem likely that we'll need to make a natural disaster emergency declaration and that's something which obviously then brings some resources in. The most immediate challenge of course is for the 3,000 or so people who are still isolated and over 300 who are in evacuation centres at the moment." said Steve Whan, NSW Emergency Services Minister.Residents are being urged not to travel through the flooded areas.Floodwaters are starting to recede, however the Bureau of Meteorology does not see an end to the heavy rains.Following the days since Steve Irwin died of a stingray attack, at least 10 stingrays have been found dead on two Australian beaches, with their tails cut off. While it was reported that fishermen occasionally cut the tails off stingrays they accidentally catch to avoid being stung, however, state fishery official Wayne Sumpton said that this practice was "uncommon".It is suspected that these killings were done in revenge for Irwin. "That's the last thing Steve would want," said Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin. However, other sources point out that fans of Irwin would generally not commit such actions.In general, stingrays are not aggressive and will not attack unless provoked.Meanwhile, a public memorial service for Irwin is planned next week.The fallout from  earthquake and tsunami catastrophes in Japan   will cost Australia about A$2 billion in lost export earnings in the near term due to lower  Australian exports to Japan, according to estimates in a Treasury brief released Thursday. After China, Japan is Australia’s largest export market, making up 15 percent of its total exports.  "The tragic events in Japan—together with the impact of floods and Cyclone Yasi at home—will clearly mean revenues take a substantial hit in the near term", Treasurer Wayne Swan said in the brief.Short term exports of "non-rural bulk commodities" are predicted to be lower as Japanese port facilities, coal-fired power stations and steel-making plants were damaged. Businesses whose export products are designated for Japan must find other customers to replace Japanese clients, the brief said. The loss of Japanese markets has been a contributor to a 6 percent drop in the price of iron ore  and an 8 percent drop in the price of coal. Japan imports account for 27 percent of Australia's iron ore and coal exports.Also on Thursday, Japan's manufacturing production index experienced  its sharpest fall in the decade since  data has been collected, indicating a steep fall in output for  most businesses in Japan in March. Recently, Japanese industry seemed to be rebounding from the global financial crisis.In Asia, concern is mounting that the electricity shortages and other disruptions to Japan's manufacturing sector will affect manufacturing in various areas of Asia, since the manufacturing of many goods are dependent on the integrated network of supply chains.In response to the Stern Report, Australia's Prime Minister John Howard announced AU$60 million to fight climate change, on 42 projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The projects are part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. "The Asia-Pacific Partnership includes countries that represent about half of the world's emissions, energy use, GDP (gross domestic product) and population, and is an important initiative that engages, for the first time, the key greenhouse-gas emitting countries in the Asia-Pacific region," Mr Howard said in a statement.Howard told the audience at the CSIRO's Ensis, a research and development organisation for the forestry industry, the government was taking practical steps to lower greenhouse gas emissions and symbolism would not clean up the air."Symbolism will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Practical methods will and that is what I'm interested in...The thing that matters is doing things" he said.More than half the money is going to projects to develop clean coal technology, including $8 million for a mobile carbon catcher for coal-fired power stations. $17.5 million will be spent on renewable energy projects, including high efficiency solar power stations and solar-enhanced transport fuels. $11 million will be spent on coal mining. $6 million will be spent on improving energy efficiency of appliances and buildings, and AU$2.5 million will be used to help the aluminium industry reduce emissions.Howard dismissed as "pure speculation" the Stern Report's more alarmist projections. "Talk about hot air. There's an enormous amount of hot air on this issue," Howard says "what we need are measures which actually achieve results." and that his announcement will achieve results.A Muslim woman has been killed by her religious apparel during a freak go-cart accident in Port Stephens, Australia. Mariam Dadoun, a 26-year-old mother, was out with her two children and husband enjoying their vacation time. While visiting Port Stephens Go-Karts, the vehicle had twisted her flowing hijab in the wheel's axle.Peter Fox of Port Stephens Local Area Command said, "the scarf was pulled across her throat [...] from one side of the body to the other side".Medical professionals on the scene succeeded in reviving Dadoun. However, she shortly died of severe neck and throat injuries after being airlifted in a Westpac rescue helicopter to the nearby John Hunter Hospital.The track has since been closed pending further investigation and a lack of proper licensing. The go-cart used in the accident has similarly been taken away for forensic examination by police authorities.The spokesman of the New South Wales division of WorkCover, an organization tasked with ensuring the safety of amusement devices, commented that, "[Go-carts are] classified as amusement devices that have to be registered for safety purposes". One go-cart on the property was found to lack proper guarding while the other had not been certified for use.Sharon and Scott Taylor were waiting in line with their children at the time. Scott said that the injuries were clearly severe as the paramedics began helping her. He added, "Her clothing had wrapped around her neck". "The cart hit the wall and stopped and she was just slumped over," remarked Sharon.Dadoun was the mother of two children, aged six and four. According to her aunt, she was a devoted caregiver and had been always willing to help others. More specifically, she remarked, "If anyone needed help, she wouldn't say no. She did a lot for everybody - for her friends, her family, her relatives." Strongly said, "You can't describe Mariam. She was the best."A leak at an offshore oil drilling rig has caused an oil slick off Australia's coast. According to the rig's operator, it could take weeks to fully plug it.Gas and oil started leaking from a hole beneath the sea floor on early Friday. It has caused an oil slick about nine miles long and thirty yards wideOfficials, however, said that there was no threat to the environment and it was improbable the slick would reach the Australian coast. Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said that "there's no threat to the Australian coast. It is evaporating naturally and the work of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will merely assist in that evaporation."69 people were evacuated from the rig on Friday, amid fears that a fire could start from the condensate oil.The rig is located approximately 150 miles off the coast of Kimberley.Australia has given a bravery award to a Sunshine Coast resident who rescued several people after an air disaster in Indonesia. Kyle Quinlan was a passenger in the March 2007 crash of a Garuda Indonesia jet in Yogyakarta.The jet overshot the runway and burst into flames. Quinlan received chest injuries but still got up and opened an emergency exit. He extinguished a fire blocking an escape and prevented panicked passengers from trampling a wounded victim. After helping an injured colleague with the Australian air force to safety, he then returned to the wreckage several times to help people before being forced to retreat by the heat."There was smoke and fire everywhere," Quinlan said of the accident, which killed 21 people from Indonesia and Australia. "People were screaming and others were dead. It was horrific."Quinlan is to receive a Bravery Medal, the second-highest bravery award, in a ceremony at the Australian Bravery Decorations early next year. "What I did that day just came naturally. I certainly don’t feel like a hero," the 26-year-old told reporters. "In that situation all I did was help. If I was in trouble I’d like to think another person would do the same for me."After the crash Quinlan travelled to hospital with his injured friend, and later worked with the Australian Embassy to give details of Australian nationals on the flight and recount his memory of how the disaster unfolded.A Royal Australian Navy (RAN) helicopter, helping victims of last week's earthquake in Indonesia, crashed Saturday night, killing nine Australians onboard,and injuring two. The Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, described the event as 'heart breaking' and said the crash of the Sea King helicopter appeared to be an accident.The 30-year old helicopter crashed on approach to Amandraya village on the remote west coast of Indonesia's island of Nias, ferrying an emergency medical team from the HMAS Kanimbla to the village. They were part of a relief effort following the devastating earthquake on Monday.Six from the Navy and three from the Air Force, died, confirmed Defence Force Chief, Lieutenant General Peter Cosgrove.The dead were seven men and two women, including four air crew, with the remainder were members of the medical relief team intending to commence operations on the ground.The two injured survivors were airlifted to Kanimbla for emergency surgery by a second helicopter from the ship that landed with a medical team after seeing smoke from the crash site."The helicopters had been working for a while in inserting, on the southern end of (Nias) island, medical teams which indeed evacuated some of the Indonesian people back to the ship for treatment. This was another one of those sorts of tasks," said the Defence Force Chief."After losing contact with that aircraft, a second Sea King from the Kanimbla, in the general area, came upon the aircraft on the ground, on a soccer field, on fire. Events unfolded from there. We know that the helicopter was flying at low height at about the time when the crash occurred. But we don't know (what went wrong)."The Kanimbla immediately scrambled its second helicopter to inspect the crash zone for a second time after Indonesian military authorities in the area suggested the other nine passengers on board may have survived. An hour later the ship's crew members were informed that all nine had been killed and their bodies were discovered in the wreckage by a team of paramedics and rescue personnel.Airworthiness investigators would immediately begin an investigation to find out the cause of the incident. Inquiries would include a coronial inquiry to be conducted in Australia.The names of the dead have been released:Royal Australian NavyLieutenant Mathew Davey from the ACT.Lieutenant Matthew Goodall from NSW.Lieutenant Paul Kimlin from the ACT.Lieutenant Jonathan King from Queensland.Petty Officer Stephen Slattery from NSW.Leading Seaman Scott Bennett from NSW.Royal Australian Air ForceSquadron Leader Paul McCarthy from West Australia.Flight Lieutenant Lynne Rowbottom from Townsville Queensland, Formerly Launceston Tas.Sergeant Wendy Jones from Queensland.The residents of Speed, a small town in the south-east of Australia, have made the decision to modify the name of the town for one month in an attempt to improve road safety in the country. The name of the town will be adjusted to SpeedKills across next month.The idea was created by the Transport Accident Commission (TAC). A campaign was launched on the social networking website Facebook, saying that if 10,000 'liked' the campaign page, the name of the town — which has a population of 45 — would be changed. 'Rename Speed' has now gone on to achieve over 33,000 likes.Previously, the government had used various advertising campaigns in an attempt to get motorists to reduce speed. However, these campaigns were in large part unsuccessful. In 2010, Australia experienced a 25% increase in deaths on rural roads . TAC spokesperson Phil Reed has stated that, with this new name change campaign, "[w]e're trying to get people to stay within the speed limits, obey road safety rules" and cause motorists to "realise that when they don't, people die".One inhabitant of Speed has also made the decision to change his name during March. Phil Down, who grows wheat and raises sheep, has decided to change his name to Phil Slow Down. Speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Down explained: "It's virtually on the road to somewhere else, so we've taken our quirky name and run with it to bring the attention to the campaign of trying to get people to slow down on country roads and especially through small towns".A massive bushfire that was threatening West Victorian towns of Great Western, Armstrong, Moyston, Pomonal, Halls Gap and Ararat has stopped spreading due to heavy rainfall giving firefighters their first relief in two days. Meanwhile, two major fires have broken out on the New South Wales Central Coast, North of Sydney with another in Sydney.The Victorian fire has destroyed 5 homes in the Stawell and two people have been injured when they fell down a mineshaft while fighting the blaze. Reports claim that the fire front was up to 30Km in length. Earlier today the fire was burning out of control, being fanned by strong winds. This afternoon a weather change came, dumping heavy rain over the region.Five major fires have been reported on the NSW Central coast in the Woy Woy and Mount White regions. 50 homes are believed to be under direct threat. Residents in affected parts of Woy Woy, Umina and Pearl beaches, and Patonga, have been taken to makeshift evacuation centres at the Gosford Leagues Club and Woy Woy Bowling Club.The Sydney Newcastle (F3 freeway) and Pacific Highway have been closed. Motorists which had been standed on the southbound carriageway of the F3 freeway were allowed through at around 6PM AEDT following fears of a wind change which could have put them in danger of the fire. Police say that the backlog was let through and the freeway remains closed.Intercity train services North of Sydney have also been affected with the railway line closed at Berowra.Dozens of fire crews and four water bombing aircraft were battling the blazes, according to bushfire volunteer Michael Wood, with changeable wind conditions starting spot fires nearby. Strong north-westerly wind gusts and temperatures of up to 44 degrees posed extremely dangerous fire conditions, the Rural Fire Service said.The Woy Woy fire front was expected to make a run to Umina and Pearl Beach in the coming hours. 300 firefighters are working to contain the flames.Cameron Wade, a spokesman for the NSW Rural Fire Service said firefighters were battling flames up to 30 metres in height, destroying several homes. A Fire Station near Woy Woy was also destroyed along with several fire trucks and volunteers cars.Mr Wade also said that crews were being called in from Sydney and the Hunter to assist local fire crews. Six aircraft and a sky crane are also being used.It is believed that winds in the Central Coast region are gusting at up to 60 km/h.Another fire in the Sydney suburb of Belrose is expected to cause problems in the next few hours.In Merimbula, on the NSW far south coast residents are being evacuated, after a fire broke containment lines.Phill Koperberg, Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service said there were fires concern at Junee and Cootamundra in southern NSW and at Appin and Bulli south of Sydney.According to an RFS spokesman, a house in Junee was destoyed and a farmer was hospitalised after receiving burns to 60 percent of his body. A total of five homes in the Junee area have been confirmed lost.About 100 people have been evacuated from Junee's outskirts amid fears that southerly winds could reach 100 kph, drastically worsening the fire situation.Three homes on the Central Coast and three in Junee have been lost.A 42 year-old woman has died following an accident during a backburning operation on a farm at Black Forest, near Bathurst in New South Wales' central west. According to police the woman died after suffering burns to 98 percent of her body.A backburn is carried out to reduce the amount of material that could fuel a fire during the bushfire season. In Australia, it is common for these backburns to be carried out this time of year, in preparation for the fire season.At around 2PM on Sunday, the woman and a group of people were conducting the backburn on the property when the wind suddenly changed direction. The woman tried to move out of the fire's path but tripped when she was climbing a fence where she was engulfed by the fire.The woman was rushed to Bathurst Base Hospital before being airlifted to the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney where she died at 1:30 a.m. today.Austrian police today found an estimated 20–50 decomposing corpses in an apparently abandoned lorry.Roadworkers who spotted the vehicle, which had been there since yesterday at least, alerted police. Responding officers found it full of corpses. The lorry is on the so-called "Eastern Motorway", the A4, close to the Hungarian border. It was on the hard shoulder between Neusiedl and Parndorf, closer to Parndorf.The victims are thought to have suffocated. Police are seeking the driver. The Krone published an image of a non-articulated food lorry on the hard shoulder, which they report is the vehicle in question. The photo shows a pool of dark liquid on the ground beside the vehicle.Video from a passing motorist shows at least one helicopter on-scene. The truck, which has pictures of meat on the side, shows branding for Slovakian food firm Hyza. Earlier today the company's website sported an apparent anti-immigration graphic, which has since been removed.Wikinews got in touch with Hyza. "We are truly sorry about [the] tragedy" they told us in a statement. They said they have checked GPS trackers on their fleet and all their vehicles remain in Slovakia. The statement says the lorry in question was one of 21 Hyza vehicles sold on last year. It was then sold again and exported to Hungary, where it is now registered. Hyza told us the new owners have not changed the branding on the vehicle. According to the Bild newspaper, Agrofert -- the parent company of Hyza -- said in a statement the new owners were required to do so.Hyza says they will "actively cooperate with Slovak police", and "express [their] sincere condolences to the bereaved families."Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner called it "a dark day" and called for European Union-wide measures to protect immigrant refugees and tackle human traffickers. Neighbouring Hungary is constructing a border fence across its entire frontier with Serbia. Yesterday alone saw a record 3,241 attempts to enter Hungary illegally, according to authorities there.Conflict in Syria and other parts of the world has led refugees to Europe. Once inside, they can move freely inside the Schengen Area, which covers most of the EU.Austrian police earlier this week arrested three motorists suspected of people smuggling. One driver is accused of moving 34 people, ten of them children, into Austria from Serbia. The group were left by the roadside near Bruck an der Leitha and reported struggling to breathe in the van.Authorities in the Mexican state of Sonora arrested 7 state officials, from the state finance department, yesterday; and charged them with negligent homicide for the deaths of 47 children in a fire at a daycare centre that occurred earlier this month.In 2005, the Hermosillo, Mexico daycare was advised to carry out repairs in a safety inspection went unheeded. It is felt that negligence contributed to the massive fire Friday afternoon, June 5, taking the lives of 47 toddlers and infants and injuring the majority of the 142 children being cared for by six staff who were also hospitalized.The ABC Daycare Centre installed a brightly coloured tarpaulin as a ceiling below the high roof.  In 2005 the owners were advised to remove the tarp, and equip emergency exits and the main exit with larger and wider regulation sized doors.  The daycare owners did not make the recommended changes, and continued to receive contracts to operate and also passed subsequent safety inspections including one a couple of weeks before the fire.Officials have determined that the fire began in the neighboring warehouse which was used by the northern Sonora state Finance Department and contained license plates, tires, and paperwork.  Nobody was working Friday and this warehouse was locked with the air conditioner left running.  The air conditioner overheated, short circuited and melted its aluminum housing which began flames in the paperwork below.  This neighboring warehouse had no fire alarms, fire extinguishers nor water sprinklers installed. "The fire was caused by the overheating of an air conditioner due to continuous and prolonged use," said Eduardo Medina Mora, the Attorney-General.The fire and smoke rose above the wall connecting the daycare and Finance Department warehouse, and was trapped in the daycare between the tarp and the warehouse ceiling.  The daycare fire alarms were installed below the tarp, and did not alert the staff to the fire trapped above the tarp until the tarp itself caught fire which instantly dispersed smoke and flames onto sleeping infants below.  One of the emergency fire exits was padlocked shut and could not be used the day of the fire by rescue teams.Seven finance department officials have been arrested on negligence and charges of negligence are to be laid also against seven others.  "They are employees and officials with the Finance Department who have a direct responsibility for the warehouse where the fire started," said Abel Murrieta, the state Attorney General.The fire chief of Hermosillo has been removed from his position.The wives of two high ranking state officials operated the privately run daycare under contract from the Social Security Institute.  These two state officials have resigned.  The owners will be charged with negligence by the state's Finance Department. The Social Security Institute will also begin a civil lawsuit against the owners. The head of the Social Security Institute has stepped down and others have been suspended.Rescuers are searching for the victims of the Tans Peru airliner crash which occurred earlier this month. Emergency services rescued 5 survivors on Thursday morning.TANS say that 41 people were killed and a further 57 injured in this, the fifth airliner crash worldwide this month. The Boeing 737-200 airliner crash-landed in heavy jungle near the city of Pucallpa, 840 kilometers (522 miles) northeast of Lima, the capital city.Peruvian authorities have ordered an investigation and have shipped the aircraft's two flight data recorders, or "black boxes" to the United States for data retrieval.Jorge Belevan said "We've also found five more survivors and that takes the number (of survivors) to 57. Two people are still missing and there are 41 dead,"  Local authorities also said that the death toll is likely to rise due to inaccessible location of the crash site.  This is the second TANS Peru plane crash in three years, following the January 2003 crash of flight 222 in the Peruvian rainforest. In that plane crash there were no survivors.Peruvian government lawyer Marco Ochoa said that rescuers are opening the skin of the aircraft to determine whether there are more bodies trapped inside.Survivors said that the plane was caught in a fierce storm about 10 minutes before the crash.  The plane then caught fire and landed in swampland.An avalanche on U.S. Route 40, which was 100 feet wide and 15 feet deep, has buried many cars, caused other cars to be pushed over the edge of an expressway, and injured eight people, just outside of Denver, Colorado. The avalanche started at 10:30 AM, starting about 12 miles off Interstate 70, and taking three different paths down the mountain before coming to a stop."Our crews said it was the largest they have ever seen. It took three paths," said a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, Stacey Stegman.All eight (7 adults, 1 minor) have been taken to the St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver. According to a hospital spokeswoman, all of the victims suffered minor injuries. Seven patients were  released on Saturday. There were no casualties.U.S. route 40 is currently closed to traffic. According to Winter Park spokesman Matt Sugar, there are no plans to close the ski hills. "We've gotten calls from all over the country asking if the resort is closed," he said, "and the answer is no."This is the third snow storm to hit the Denver area in three weeks.Two people in the Canadian Rocky Mountains were killed yesterday in an avalanche that struck an informal meeting of 200 snowmobilers. 30 others were hurt, and nineteen people were treated and released at a hospital.According to reports, the incident occurred on Boulder Mountain near Revelstoke, British Columbia on Saturday at 15.30 local time; officials believe several more people may be trapped beneath the rubble."The Canadian Avalanche Centre [CAC] based in Revelstoke has had a warning for the last three weeks expressing extreme caution in the backcountry," commented Revelstoke mayor David Raven, who noted that the gathering had not been authorised. "A fresh snowfall overnight exacerbated that warning. I know people have been cautioned again and again," he said to CTV Newsnet. The CAC reports that there were ten avalanches in the vicinity since Friday.Local police conducted a room-to-room search of a nearby hotel to establish whether anybody with the group was missing. Meanwhile, rescue teams dispatched helicopters to the mountain to see if it was safe to launch a more thorough ground search.An avalanche near Vail, Colorado trapped four people Tuesday, killing one person later identified as Anthony "Tony" Seibert, and injuring the other three. Anthony Seibert was the grandson of Peter Seibert Sr., who with Earl Eaton around 1960 cofounded the resort area in the backcountry that would become part of the Vail Ski Resort.The Eagle County Coroner reported the avalanche happened around 11:30 A.M. local time (1830 UTC) in an area known as the East Vail Chutes, near the ski resort of Vail. Spencer Logan of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center said the area is locally known as dangerous, having already killed two people in 2008. The other three have been found and reported to have suffered nonfatal injuries, walking away from the incident without needing hospital care.The Colorado Avalanche Information Center reports five fatalities this season, including another in Colorado on December 31, on Parkview Mountain west of Willow Creek Pass, and a snowmobiler in Big Sky, Montana on New Year's Day. A friend of the Seibert family, Scott Klumb, told CNN Seibert's death reminds people "to be careful in the backcountry [...] As exciting as it may look, you have to take the proper precautions."Peter Seibert Sr. was renowned in the skiing business as, among other roles, the first president of Vail Associates, which he helped make one of the largest and most popular ski resorts in the US. He died aged 77 in July 2002.Bird Flu has been found in a parrot under quarantine which was being imported from Surinam, South America. It has been confirmed as the lethal H5N1 strain found predominantly in Asia. It is speculated that the flu might have originated from Taiwanese birds which had previously been kept with the South American birds, as no other H5N1  cases have yet been reported in Surinam. This is the first case of avian flu found in birds destined to be imported to the United Kingdom since the recent outbreak affecting many parts of the world. The BBC has said that all birds in the quarantine unit are now being culled. People who may have come into contact with them will be given anti-viral treatment as a precaution.Although the case was found in the UK it does not affect the UK's 'disease free' status because the bird was under quarantine.Autopsies from casualties of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month, reveal fractures in leg bones, suggesting that the jet may have been torn apart in midair.A Brazilian medical examiners' spokesman said on Wednesday that autopsies found fractures on an undisclosed fraction of the fifty or so bodies that have been found from the wreck of the plane so far."We can say there is a little less uncertainty, so there is a little more optimism," Paul-Lois Arslanian, the leader of the French aviation accident investigation agency BEA, said. However, he added that "it is premature for the time being to say what happened."Frank Ciacco, a former forensic expert for the United States National Transportation Safety Board, said that "typically, if you see intact bodies and multiple fractures — arm, leg, hip fractures — it's a good indicator of a midflight break up. Especially if you're seeing large pieces of aircraft as well."Air France Flight 447 was an Airbus A330 that had departed from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, en route to Paris, France, when it disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean on June 1. A search investigation has found several parts of the jet, as well as some bodies of the passengers on board, but the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, which could contain important information as to how exactly the plane crash occurred, are yet to be found.An Azerbaijan passenger plane has crashed after taking off from the country's capital, Baku, officials say. There was no immediate confirmation of casualties, but the plane is thought to have been carrying at least 18 people. The Azerbaijan Airlines (Azal) aircraft was heading to Aktau in Kazakhstan, according to Russian news sources.The Ria news agency said the plane took off at 2119 (1819 GMT) but disappeared from radar screens 20 minutes later as it flew along the Caspian Sea coast. It is reported to have come down near the village of Kyurdakhany, about 15km (10 miles) from Baku, Ria said. An interior ministry official told the AFP news agency that the plane had crashed with 23 people on board. The Associated Press news agency described the plane as an An-140 twin engine turboprop. A police spokesman, who gave his name as Kadykov, told Reuters news agency: "The plane has crashed, 23 people on board are dead. An operations centre was set up near the Caspian coastline some 20km (13 miles) north of Baku, AP reported. A doctor at a hospital in Baku said that two bodies were recovered from the suspected crash site. Baku and Akmau are centres of the Caspian Sea oil industry.An eight-month old boy, Andrew, was attacked and killed by a Doberman pinscher in Brooklyn, New York.  The dog was a three-year old named Mackabee, who is also neutered.The grandmother was babysitting the boy. While she was in the kitchen she heard the boy scream and ran next door to a neighbor for help. The neighbor took the dog off the boy, rescued him and brought him to his house to try and perform CPR on the boy, while he called 911 for help.Police said the baby's head was in bad shape and the dog broke the boy's skull. Andrew was sent to Kings County Medical.The doctors tried to save his life by working on him for nearly an hour, but the boy died at 3:06 pm local time.  The parents of the child were not home at the time of the incident. The dog was shot with a tranquilizer and was sent to a care center. The city Department of Health is investigating. The dog may have to be put down because of the incident.According to the US Centers for Disease Control, the Doberman Pinscher is not frequently involved in fatal attacks on humans in comparison to several other dog breeds such as German Shepherd Dogs, Rottweilers and others.According to an announcement from Gwent Police, a baby boy has died after being found abandoned behind a convenience store in Gwent, Wales. The boy, who has not yet been identified, was found behind a Spar convenience store in the town of Cwmcarn at 1815 GMT on Tuesday. The baby was found to be wrapped in a towel which was in a plastic shopping bag. Bystanders who were walking past the scene mistakenly believed that the bag had been unintentionally left there by a person who had visited the gym that is located next to the store.A 14-year-old boy, who is the son of the man who owns the convenience store, then examinied the bag and discovered the baby. He made a phone call to the emergency services, however, when the baby was taken to Royal Gwent Hospital, it was pronounced dead on arrival. The baby was younger than one day old at the time of his death. A post-mortem examination proved to be indeterminate. Gwent Police have now launched an investigation to try and determine the identity of the baby's mother.Gursewak Singh, the father of the person who discovered the baby and the owner of the shop, explained: "We asked friends and colleagues what the bag was doing there, but it didn't belong to anyone. A boy who works with us said it was just a towel in there and he didn't open it. In the evening I went out to it and opened it, only saw a towel on top and didn't look thoroughly. I just thought it was clothes underneath and didn't want to root through them. I picked it up and hanged it on the gatepost so someone walking by might see it and recognise it as theirs. At about six o'clock there was a power cut and my 14-year-old son went out and picked up the bag and opened it and saw a little head in there. He called his uncle and said: 'It's not clothes, come and look'. They came over and saw the baby in there." Singh commented that this incident "was shocking. We were all devastated. I wish we had checked earlier. If we had gone through the bag we could have made a difference. I'm worried what sort of condition the person who left the bag is in. We are so concerned about her. Other people saw the bag, but nobody thought about it. There could be a baby still alive. I wish we had checked straight away."Gwent Police member Superintendent John Burley stated about this case: "We are extremely concerned about the health and wellbeing of the mother of the baby and are appealing for her to come forward to receive any medical treatment she may require. This is a tragic incident which will sadden the local community and our priority at the moment is finding the mother of the baby. I would appeal to anyone who may have been in the vicinity of the Spar store on Thursday morning or afternoon who may be able to offer any information to assist our inquiry."On Thursday, November 22, Thanksgiving Day, Bradley Priebe, a one-year-old baby boy fell from a third floor apartment window in New York City, New York. He has now been allowed to leave the hospital after staying overnight for observation. According to reports, the child sustained no serious injures from the fall and is in stable condition. Anna Priebe, the baby's mother says that it is "a miracle" that her son did not break any bones. Brandon, the father, says that the boy is doing "good. Everything's OK."Bradley crawled out of the window and fell onto the roof of a Bronx music shop. The window was nearly 20 feet from the ground. The family thought the window was closed.Police say that there is no reason to suspect that the incident is a criminal action, and no charges have been filed against the parents.Maverick Thomas, a baby, just over a day old is in critical condition at the Hennepin County Medical Center's burn unit in Minnesota in the United States after his oxygen hood caught fire burning 18% of his body. He was under care by doctors at Mercy Hospital located in Coon Rapids when the fire occurred on Tuesday January 22.Thomas, which is his middle name, had only been born 12 hours prior to the fire, nearly three weeks too early. He was receiving oxygen through a 'open-toped bassinet' when the gas contributed to igniting something inside his incubator, causing it to burst into flames.Hospital staff, who were present when the incubator ignited, were able to quickly put out the fire, but not before Thomas suffered severe burns ranging from second degree to third degree. Doctors say that his condition is classified as life-threatening, but is expected to survive.Police and fire officials are investigating the incident and are questioning hospital staff while searching for physical evidence as to what could has caused the fire. The Food and Drug Administration is also launching an investigation.Officials have not released the family name to protect the privacy of the family.A 6-month-old child is alive, having only received minor injuries, after the stroller it was riding in was run over by a commuter train in Melbourne, Australia. The entire incident was recorded by security cameras at Ashburton railway station, where the incident occurred.Security video footage shows the mother tending to her baby who was in a stroller. She then moves the stroller a safer distance from the tracks. After letting go of the stroller for a second, it rolled towards the tracks and fell off the platform, being struck and dragged nearly 30 meters by the arriving train. Police say the brakes on the stroller were not applied. The baby only received a minor cut to the head, and had already been rescued before authorities arrived on scene. Mother and baby were taken to Royal Children's Hospital and released shortly thereafter. At a press conference following the incident, Michael Ferweda, a police spokesperson called it a "miracle" that no one was injured and that the mother was not at fault. No charges are going to be filed. "It was a lucky escape and a chance for commuters to think about heeding warnings to be more careful around platforms," he added. The name of the baby and mother have not been released.Jon Wright, one of the responding paramedics who treated the baby said, "Fortunately the train was slowing as it pulled into the station. The baby received a bump to his head and was distressed when we arrived. Luckily he was strapped into his pram at the time, which probably saved his life."While Aid starts to pour in to the worst hit areas of South Asia Earthquake that has killed more than 30,000 people, bad weather is hampering the relief efforts with snow falling on the peaks of the earthquake-devastated areas of Pakistan.The measure of human suffering can't just be measured in the death toll, which officially stands at 23,000, but also in the 4 million who have been made homeless, hungry, and cold with 1 million in acute need, facing certain death without outside assistance. In the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir, authorities say at least 1,300 people are known to have died, but officials fear the number will rise.ABC Australia reports of a man in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, who has been cut from aid, saying "I find that we are alone now. We have nothing. We are finished."Choppers are the main lifeline of support; trucks are unable to deliver relief supplies due to looting and general mayhem on the ground. The more snow, the less able aid agencies are to make their way to those in the direst need.Jan Vandemoortele, U.N. Resident Coordinator for Pakistan, said key roads into the quake zone have been reopened, as 30 countries including Australia, France, Japan, Jordan, China, Russia, Iran, Syria and the US provide assistance in the form of money, doctors, tents, blankets, and disaster relief teams.United Nations officials are warning of a growing threat of measles, cholera, and diarrhea outbreaks among the millions of survivors.There have been no reports of epidemic outbreaks so far, but the area's health infrastructure has completely collapsed, Vandemoortele said.Families of victims of the Station nightclub fire, which killed 100 people on Rhode Island in 2003, have expressed their support for the parole of Great White band manager Daniel Biechele, currently 16 months into a four year jail sentence for his role in the disaster.Biechele admitted to illegally setting off the pyrotechnics that started the fire, and broke down as he told victims' relatives that he couldn't expect their forgiveness. He has been jailed since May 2006.The pyrotechnics ignited highly flammable soundproofing foam in the nightclub, and the ensuing rapid conflagration trapped people in the building. Many families have expressed their belief that venue owners Jeffrey and Michael Derderian maintained the building in an unsafe state. Michael received another four-year sentence but is not yet eligible for parole, while Jeffrey avoided prison time.Leland Hoisington, whose 28-year-old daughter Abbie was killed in the fire, told reporters "I think they should not even bother with a hearing _ just let Biechele out... I just don't find him as guilty of anything." The state parole board received approximately 20 letters, the majority of which expressed their sympathy and support for Daniel, some going as far as describing him as a "scapegoat" of limited responsibility.Board chairwoman Lisa Holley told journalists of her surprise at the forgiving of the families, saying "I think the most overwhelming part of it for me was the depth of forgiveness of many of these families that have sustained such a loss,". A letter written by Dave Kane and Joanne O'Neill, parents of youngest victim Nicholas O'Neill, released their letter to the board to reporters. "In the period following this tragedy, it was Mr. Biechele, alone, who stood up and admitted responsibility for his part in this horrible event... "He apologized to the families of the victims and made no attempt to mitigate his guilt," it said.Others pointed out that he sent a handwritten letter to the families of each of the hundred victims and that he has a work release position in a local charity.The owner of the Santika Club, site of the 2009 Bangkok nightclub fire, is to be charged along with twelve other directors over the disaster. 62 people were killed and 229 injured by the blaze, thought to have been triggered by New Year fireworks on the stage, although investigations are ongoing."I feel very sorry for what had happened. I want to apologise to victims' family members," said Mr Setsawat, the club's owner. The club had just three exits, of which one was known only to staff and another locked. A number of people died in the stampede for the door. There was also only one fire extinguisher and the venue was only licensed as a snack bar closing at midnight.Setsawat has already been charged with allowing an underage customer into the club after a 17-year-old student's body was recovered from the charred remnants of the club. He now faces further charges of carelessness resulting in death. The charges will be pressed once paperwork has cleared, police have indicated. 31 people remain in critical condition in hospitals.Following the Pilkhana massacre which occurred February 25 and 26 leaving 74 dead and the inferno at the Bashundhara City shopping mall complex March 13 leaving seven dead, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said security measures are being tightened countrywide across Bangladesh.Fire drills will be enacted at all key-point installations (KPI). Fire fighting systems will be examined by the fire brigade and the public works department (PWD) to ensure functionality. Security measures will be enhanced supplementing areas under private security such as at the Bashundhara City Complex.The Fire Service and Civil Defence Department requires modernization and needs new equipment to fight fires past the sixth floor of buildings. The Fire Brigade says it needs turntable ladders, snorkels, foam-tenders, lighting units, emergency tenders, fireproof uniforms, and rescue ropes for fire fighting and rescue operations. Transportation to fires is also an issue due to narrow roads, low electrical wires and congestion.The Bangladesh National Building Code requires fire fighting equipment installed in buildings over seven floors. This code is to be monitored by authorities to ensure compliance with the new guidelines and to make sure buildings are being maintained.The Bashundhara City Complex opened Monday for shoppers two days after Friday's blaze. A probe is underway to determine the cause of the fire and to assess structural damage.Loss of life was minimized as the blaze broke out on a Friday, the beginning of the weekend in Bangladesh, so offices in the upper floors were empty. The lower eight floors are used for shopping and the upper floors are all Bashundhara Group offices.The mall is valued at Tk 7.0 billion (US$100 million). It is not known if the complex is covered by fire insurance.It is estimated that it will take over two years to rebuild the area damaged by flames which were burned down to a skeleton. Bashundhara City's technical advisor, Latifur Rahman, estimated damages at Tk 2.0 billion (US$29m).Only one television cameraman has been allowed in to film the burnt area. None of the 2,500 shops, cinemas or cafes were burnt by the inferno. The seventh and eighth floors still experience smoke damage, and there was water damage to merchandise.A three member committee is currently investigating the cause of the fire which will consist of Iqbal Khan Chowdhury, joint secretary of the ministry, representatives of the police, IGP Noor Muhammad, and fire brigade, Director General Abu Nayeem Md Shahidullah. The committee is required to report within the week with their findings. The forensics department is also sifting through the burnt remains.The Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries has also formed a committee which has begun interviewing witnesses and recording their testimony alongside the government committee.It has been discovered that 150 closed circuit cameras were not being used when the fire started. Another mystery is why the mall fire fighting system has been found unused."In the shopping mall there is an ultra-technology elevator which runs even without electricity but we have found that locked," Iqbal Khan Chowdhury, joint secretary (Police) of the home ministry, said. "Why the fire burnt so fiercely is a matter to think. We have to see if there was any incendiary substance there. These matters seem to be mysterious."Mall management has been asked to submit substances and items which would have been in the upper floors when the fire started. The fire erupted on the 17th floor and spread quickly to the two floors above and engulfed the three floors below. The aerial ladders belonging to the Fire Service and Civil Defence reached as high as the 13th floor of the 21-storey building.Videos have been sent to the United States (US) for examination to assist in determining the cause of the fire and to help in the damage assessment. Experts from the US are expected to arrive soon.Firefighters were brought to the rooftop of the 20-storey tower by helicopter. The only fatality in this operation was Baki Billa, a firefighter of Bashundhara City firefighting department, who fell when climbing down a rope from a helicopter to the roof of the building. Three other firefighters made the transition safely. At this same time, the chief security officer was safely rescued by the Bangladesh Air Force helicopter, a Bell 212. Six security officers of the complex also lost their lives.Stormy weather in Bangladesh left at least 23 people dead over the weekend and thousands more homeless. The storms, which are common between April and June, swept over the Mymensingh area and destroyed crops and trees.Most of the deaths were said to have occurred when farmers harvesting rice paddy fields were struck by lightning. Six were in the Habiganj District. Additionally, the lightning killed two teenage brothers in Haluaghat tending to cattle in a field near their home. Dozens of other people received injuries and were transported to hospitals. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department had issued warnings for continued severe weather.A Batavia Air Boeing 737-400 has landed safely after a segment of wing up to two metres in size separated from the aircraft 15 minutes after takeoff on a domestic flight between Jakarta, Indonesia and Pontianak late on Wednesday night.Batavia spokesman Anton Situmeang commented that the aircraft, which was carrying 138 passengers and six crew, could have continued to its destination without the part, but had returned for an emergency landing as a precaution. He went on to say that the plane's last major service was only a month or two ago, and consequently Batavia have launched their own independent investigation.Indonesia's National Transport Safety Committee senior investigator Frans Wenas told reporters that the missing part had been located close to the airport. News website Detik.com is quoted by the International Herarld Tribune as saying that the piece struck a house, but there are no reports of injuries on the ground.Deregulation of the Indonesian airline industry in the 1990s has resulted in the startup of many new budget carriers, including Batavia Air. However, industry analysists have raised concerns that deregulation has resulted in lax safety standards and poor industry supervision. Indonesia is now trying to address the concerns ahead of an EU review of the decision to add all Indonesian airlines to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.A house in Eglinton, a village suburb of Bathurst in Central-Western New South Wales has been significantly damaged after being hit by a truck just before 3 p.m. today. It is not known if anyone was inside the house at the time the accident occurred. Police said no major injuries were sustained as a result of the accident.The accident occurred in light rain and the road surface was moderately wet.It is believed that the truck was traveling along Eleven Mile Drive, Eglinton when a Subaru Forester pulled into its path from a side street. The Subaru had been required to give way to the truck. The truck struck the Subaru, hitting it and pushing it down the road before losing control and hitting a house on the opposite side of the road.The driver of the truck was trapped inside his vehicle for around 15 minutes before being released by rescue personnel, the driver of the Subaru was taken by ambulance to the Bathurst Base Hospital to ensure they were not suffering any major injuries.When the truck hit the house, a gas line was ruptured creating a hazard for rescue crews. The pipeline's operator - Agility disconnected the line after the truck driver was rescued. Police also requested that electricity to the house be disconnected.It was not until 4:15 p.m. that approval was given for the truck to be pulled from the house. It is expected that engineers from Bathurst Regional Council will inspect the house to determine if it is still structurally safe.While it is not unusual in Bathurst for trucks to hit homes, it is unusual for such an accident to occur at this location. Most accidents of this nature occur on the Great Western Highway, which intersects the city and is a freight gateway to the region.At approximately 00:26 hrs, on Wednesday, March 22, the British Columbia ferry MV Queen of the North hit a rock near Gil Island in Wright Sound, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, 75 from the start of ship's schedule journey from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy on the Northern tip of Vancouver IslandPort Hardy. The ship missed a course change and ran agroung off Gil Island. It took about an hour for the ferry to sink, giving passengers time to get out. The vessel was carrying 101 passengers and crew, and all but 2 were accounted for. Thanks to quick-response of nearby aboriginal fishing villager of Hartley Bay, and the CCGS Sir Wiflrid Laurier. Survivors were quickly fetched from the Queen of the North's lifeboat and brought to Hartley Bay and onboard the coast Guard ship, and eventually back to Prince Rupert onboard the Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Hartley Bay. The Queen of the North, is (apx) 9,000 gross ton, motor driven vessel, built in Germany in 1969. The Queen of the North had been on this 15 hrs, 274 nautical mile ferry run since late May 1980. In the summer and on relief work, her smaller sister ship, the Queen of Prince Rupert also performs that run.A six-year-old girl was killed after a black bear attacked her. Her mother and two-year-old brother, also attacked, were critically injured.The nearly 400-pound bear attacked the family when they were staying at Chilwoee Campground located within the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee. The family was visiting a nearby waterfall when they were attacked.According to rescuers, the girl managed to escape from the bear, but was found only an hour later by a rescuer who fired shots that scared the bear away."Allegedly, after the rescue squad found the little girl, one of the squad members fired a shot from a small-caliber handgun. We don't know whether the bear was hit or not. There was no blood, but it chased off," said Dan Hicks, a spokesman for the states Wildlife Resources Agency.The mother and the brother both remain in critical condition at a hospital in Chattanooga. The boy's skull was punctured by a bite to the head, before the bear attacked his mother. The mother was trying to scare the bear away with rocks and sticks before being attacked. According to doctors, she had several puncture wounds to her neck, but had too many other claw and teeth marks for them to count. Both are expected to recover.Investigators have not yet been able to speak to the mother because of the severity of her injuries. "She may not remember the attack at all," said Hicks, who also said that it was only Tennessee's second documented attack involving a bear."There is a chance that the same bear would attack someone else, so I hope they do catch him," said Lynn Rogers of the North American Bear Center.Officials have baited traps with honey buns and doughnuts to try and catch the bear.Authorities have not yet released the names of the victims. The campground has been closed.Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto, who was killed in a suicide attack yesterday, has been buried in her ancestral home in the village of Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Meanwhile, violence has erupted across the nation in protest to the 54-year-old opposition leader's death.The Pakistani government has claimed to have evidence to suggest that al Qaeda were responsible for attacking her at the end of her address to an election rally. One spokesperson for the Interior Ministry said "We have intelligence intercepts indicating that al Qaeda leader Baitullah Mehsud is behind her assassination." Mehsud, believed to be in Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan, is one of Pakistan's most wanted criminals.Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, a head of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, told the Asia Times by telephone that the group had indeed been responsible, saying "This is our first major victory against those who have been siding with infidels in a fight against Al Qaeda and declared a war against mujahideen,"  and that anti-Shi'ite militant group Lashkar-i-Jhangvi carried out the attack on al Qaeda's behalf.United States federal bodies are attempting to verify that al Qaeda were responsible. One official told the Associated Press that a bulletin circulated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security to law enforcement groups mentioned several Islamist websites posting claims of responsibility. Director of National Intelligence spokesman Ross Feinstein commented that they were "in no position right now to confirm who may have been responsible."Unrest in Sindh, Bhutto's home province, was to the extent that the military has been called in to the area. According to officials, unrest since her death has resulted in 32 deaths, including those of four police officers. 23 of the deaths were in Sindh. It is feared that recent events could cause Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to postpone an election intended to place Pakistan back under civilian rule, which is currently planned for January 8.Soldiers were told to shoot to kill violent protesters on sight, as scores of people set up roadblocks and torched hundreds of cars, trucks and buses. Other areas also saw violence; an election meeting in the Northwest suffered a bomb attack that killed a candidate for Musharrif's party and seven others, whilst one was killed in the city of Lahore.Thousands lined the way as Bhutto's coffin, draped in the tricolor of the Pakistan People's Party, was transported the 7km to the family mausoleum, accompanied by Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari. She was laid to rest alongside the body of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, himself a former Prime Minister hung after a military coup. Zardini prayed at the site alongside their three children, son Bilawal, 19, and daughters Bakhtawar, 17 and Aseefa, 14. Bhutto's two brothers, whose deaths remain officially unexplained, are also buried at the site, which she had herself arranged the construction of.Reuters reported that many at the scene chanted slogans in opposition to Musharraf and to the United States, who for many years have supported Musharraf. "Shame on the killer Musharraf, shame on the killer U.S.," the news agency quoted the mourners as saying. Meanwhile, one farmer told them "Bhutto was my sister and Bhutto was like my mother... With her death, the world has ended for us."Musharraf, a former army general, seized power in an armed 1999 coup. For many years he has had US support in the hope that he can keep control in the unstable country, which is afflicted with Islamic extremist violence.Economics in the country have also been much affected, Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments, commented that "Unrest in Pakistan is eroding the market sentiment dramatically as Pakistan, unlike North Korea or Iran, is known to really have nuclear weapons." Although the affect was generally to decrease values, lower risk investments, such as gold, went up in demand. India has reacted to the violence by ordering immediate suspension of all cross-border bus and rail services with Pakistan amid fears that violence will spread. Extremists are known to attack trains, including one attack in February where 68 people died on an Indian train heading for Pakistan. Indian border forces have been put on alert, although no specific threats have yet been identified. Relations between the two countries are peaceful but tense, and Indian border forces regularly go on alert at times of crisis in Pakistan.A BHP Billiton nickel mine at Leinster, 645Km northeast of Perth, Western Australia has halted operations after the death of a mine worker. WA Police say Mark Quinn, 32, an employee of mining contractor MacMahon's, working about 900 metres underground, was killed in an explosion.The cause of the explosion is not yet known. Department of Community and Employment Protection investigators have travelled to the site from Kalgoorlie to conduct an inquiry.Global resources giant BHP Billiton Ltd./Plc, says employees are being briefed and counselled over the incident. The mine will remain closed until the investigation is complete. Police will prepare a report for the coroner. According to media reports, no-one else was injured in the explosion - the cause of which is not yet known. The accident comes almost two years after a BHP Billiton worker died in a gas explosion at the Boodarie iron plant in Port Hedland, WA. The plant was then abandoned after the incident in May 2004.In April 2004, a man was killed at BHP Billiton's Nelson Point facility, also at Port Hedland in WA. In May 2000 a truck driver was killed at a BHP Pilbara iron ore operation in WA. BHP Billiton employ some 37,000 people at over 100 operations in 25 countries.Coal mines in the United States' West Virginia district were also suspended earlier this week, due to increased amounts of miners' deaths.BHP Billiton Ltd says its underground Leinster nickel mine in Western Australia, where a contractor was killed in an explosion last week, will stay shut until the outcomes of a government investigation are released.A BHP spokesman in Perth refused to estimate how long company and government officials will take to investigate the incident. "These investigations can go on for quite some time and the mine will remain closed for that same length of time, said Brian Watt. "But it's difficult to speculate"Watt declined to comment on how much damage the underground explosion caused to the mine, or how much time would be needed to bring the operation back on line once a decision to resume is made.BHP Billiton have confirmed the death at the Leinster Nickel Operation, north of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia - 950 km north east of Perth. BHP said the incident occurred late in the afternoon of Friday, February 3. Mark Quinn, 32, from Broken Hill in far western New South Wales and an employee of MacMahon’s, was fatally injured. He was working approximately 900 meters underground when an explosion occurred. BHP said in a media release that there were no other persons injured as a result of the incident.The cause of the explosion is not yet known. Operations at Leinster have been stopped and employees at site are being briefed and counseled.BHP Billiton is the world's third largest nickel producer, with the Leinster mine producing up to 45,000 metric tons of nickel concentrates a year.Following speculations that Leinster's closure may lead to a nickel shortage, a spokesperson told Reuters that BHP Billiton had sufficient nickel concentrate stockpiled to last until the mine reopens. The Western Australian government has described the fatality rate in the mining industry as "deplorable and atrocious". John Bowler, Western Australia's Employment Protection Minister says he will consider implementing changes to improve the safety record of the mining industry. Mr Quinn's death is the third underground fatality and the fourth mining death this financial year. The new Minister, John Bowler, says he will consider implementing any changes needed to improve safety in the industry.The science journal Nature devoted a special section to the Asian H5N1 virus, or "Avian Flu", highlighting the danger it poses to world populations, and cautioning that unless steps are taken soon, it could lead to the deaths of many millions and lead to a major economic crisis. Their analysis shows a danger of it mutating into a strain with a lethality similar to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.Michael Osterholm, a scientist at the University of Minnesota, gave grave caution about the situation. "Time is running out to prepare for the next pandemic... There is a critical need for comprehensive medical and non-medical pandemic planning at the ground level that goes beyond what has been considered so far."The next pandemic is projected to originate in poultry in Asia, due either to the H5N1 virus adapting on its own or mixing with genetic material from a human virus. In the journal, virologists at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam strongly urged better organized research into outbreaks in Asia, calling the current efforts patchy and uncoordinated, saying, "We propose establishing a permanent global task force to control a flu pandemic, in which relevant agencies would work together with leading research groups from different disciplines." The annual cost of this task force would be less than $1.5 million annually.Deaths due to the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak reached between 20-50 million people, on the order of roughly 2% of the Earth's population of nearly 2 billion at the time; the Earth's population has increased by more than threefold since then. This disease spread around the world in the course of six months, killing 25 million. India was particularly hard hit, with 17 million deaths. Half a million died in the USA, and 200,000 in the UK. It is estimated to have afflicted about 20% of the world's population to some extent, before it vanished eighteen months after its initial outbreak.Birmingham police have re-opened the British city's centre after evacuating 20,000 people from it last night.The cordon had been largely lifted at 6am BST after the centre was sealed off for most of the night.Police Chief Constable Paul Scott said on Sunday that "a real and very credible threat" had faced Birmingham, but he declined to be specific about its nature.However he stressed that the intelligence he had received indicated that the threat had been genuine.Scott said that the evacuation had been "a proportionate response to the information. We haven't had this level of threat before, the people of Birmingham were in danger last night."But the Chief Constable also explained that "I do not believe that the incident that we are dealing with this evening is connected with the events of July 7 in London."Four controlled explosions were carried out on a bus to destroy suspected explosive devices after a call by a member of the public, but later investigations showed that they had been safe. A further suspicious package at the Travelodge hotel on Broad Street was also declared safe.The United States military may have found the Black Boxes from a missing Indonesian jetliner that went missing on January 1, 2007.Using ultrasonic pinger signals, the USNS Mary Sears located debris on the bottom of the ocean that match the signal that they are using to find the boxes. "[We have] detected heavy debris scattered over a wide area," said the U.S. embassy in Indonesia in a statement. Other debris may also have been located at least 1,000 meters below the oceans surface."During the search of the projected crash site of Adam Air Flight 574, the Mary Sears, using a Towed Pinger Locator, detected pingers on the same frequency of the black box associated with the missing airplane," added the statement.Despite the announcement, Indonesia's transport safety board denies receiving any reports that the boxes have been found."One thing is for sure, up until this second, I have not received any report from the (Indonesian) liaison officers who were onboard the ship," said Indonesian air force commander who is in charge of the ongoing search to find the plane, Eddy Suyanto.The largest piece of the plane to be recovered so far, is the tail of the plane, which was discovered by a fisherman. Trays and seats have also been recovered, but so far none of the bodies of the passengers or crew have been found.The plane, a Adam Air Boeing 737-400 went missing, in flight from Surabaya, on the island of Java, to Manado on the island Sulawesi. All 102 people on board the plane are believed to have been killed.Just 1 day after the plane crashed, false reports that the wreckage was found on land and 12 survivors were found had began to circulate. The 12 people that were reported to have been survivors, turned out to be the remaining survivors of a ferry crash in the same area 4 days before the plane was reported missing.The cause of the crash is still not known, and investigations are ongoing.The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or "black boxes", from an Air France plane that crashed on June 1 last year in the Atlantic Ocean, have been localized to within about 2 square miles (5 square kilometers), a French official said on Thursday.The French government and military officials have urged caution, saying there is no guarantee the flight recorders will be found. French navy spokesman Hugues du Plessis d'Argentre commented to AFP, "[I]t's like trying to find a shoe box in an area the size of Paris, at a depth of 3,000m (9,800ft) and in a terrain as rugged as the Alps."The aircraft, an Airbus A330-200, carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members, for a total of 228 people on board, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean after flying in bad weather. The pitot tubes, which measure airspeed, are considered likely to have been a contributing factor to the crash. However, the actual cause has yet to be determined.The search is now in its third phase, which started on March 30 – April 1, 2010 and was originally announced to last 30 days. However, on May 4, the search was extended to May 25.Eight months after the January 1st crash of Adam Air Flight 574 into Indonesian waters, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) have been retrieved from the wreckage.The devices, collectively referred to as 'black boxes', had remained unrecovered over a dispute between the Indonesian government and the airline over who would bear the costs of salvage.Only recently has a contract been signed with United States salvage firm Phoenix International, who arrived last week in Indonesia to receive the recorders, working co-operatively with the Indonesian Transport Safety Commission (ITSC) and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).The boxes were located by an underwater remotely operated vehicle searching the seabed near Majene, Sulawesi, where the plane went down. They were approximately 2,000 metres (6,500 ft) down and 1,400 metres apart. The FDR was recovered on August 27 at midday and the CVR was retrieved the following day at 10 a.m.According to Tatang Kurniadi, chairman of the ITSC, the boxes exibit only minor physical damage, but there is currently no way of knowing if the data they contain has been damaged or destroyed by their prolonged stay underwater.The devices will now be sent to Washington for analysis by NTSB specialists.As of September 1, 2005, Blackwater USA [1] sent equipment and security forces to the Hurricane Katrina disaster area, including a SA-330J Puma helicopter, with the stated purpose of assisting in the evacuation of citizens from flooded areas.  A later press release on Blackwater USA's web site confirms that their privately contracted forces are on the ground in New Orleans, being used to secure petrochemical facilities and provide security services for the federal government.Private citizens are also reported to be hiring Blackwater "military warriors" and bodyguards to protect them and/or their expensive homes in New Orleans, such as in the Garden District, despite the repeated mandatory evacuation orders of all civilians by local, state, and federal authorities.  One publication has reported that the number of soldiers for hire could be in the hundreds, as told to them by the commander of Blackwater's operations in the city.  Israeli mercenaries from the firm known as ISI were also seen guarding a gated community, and were wearing full military gear including bulletproof vests and M16 assault rifles.Blackwater has a history of being employed by the U.S. government and by private contractors across Iraq over the last two years to protect civilian and military convoys and provide security and bodyguarding services.A British airways flight from London, England to Miami, Florida containing British prime minister Tony Blair has missed a taxiway at Miami airport. The Boeing 747-400 plane hit lights as it was turning off the runway onto a taxiway taxiing at 1815 local time on Tuesday evening (2315 GMT).The pilot couldn't see the correct taxiway due to poor lighting, said British Airways spokesman John Lampl.Prime minister Tony Blair, with his family, was on his way to stay with Bee Gees star Robin Gibb at his house in Miami Beach when the incident occurred. The plane and all 343 passengers onboard were not damaged or hurt.A U.S. safety board has said that it's now investigating the incident.British Prime Minister Tony Blair has apologised to Britons affected by Hurricane Katrina. Many British citizens who were trapped in the New Orleans have complained to the British Foreign Office about the lack of response from their government after the hurricane destabilized almost 200 miles of the United States gulf coast.British nationals living and vacationing in New Orleans reported that U.S. authorities had refused to evacuate them as Hurricane Katrina approached the city, leaving them stranded in their hotels.  President George W. Bush has been criticized for refusing material aid from France and Britain in rescuing people trapped in New Orleans.Another blast shook the Ukrainian coal mine Zasyadko in Donetsk, where over 100 miners died in a methane blast in November. According to the United Press International news agency, 52 miners were injured. The ITAR TASS news agency reports also that most of them suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and were taken to an occupational diseases treatment clinic, while seven were hospitalised at the central hospital of the Donetsk region.Marina Nikitina, a local officer of the Ukrainian's industrial safety agency Gosgorpromnadzor, informed the press that all of the 385 miners who were underground when the explosion occurred, have been already evacuated. According to her, the blast took place at 5.55 a.m. EET (UTC+2) in an isolated part of the collery at the deep of 1078 metres, where 63 people were working. A Ukrainian TV channel Kanal 5 reports the disaster has been caused by a methane blast. It informs also that Vitalij Shevchenko, the mine's general engineer, has been ousted from his post by the Ukrainian mining supervision. It is the second explosion in two weeks that happened in the pit. The November 18 blast is regarded among the Ukrainian media as the worst coal-mining disaster in Ukraine's post-Soviet history. Today's blast is a part of deadly series of accidents in the Ukrainian coal mining industry; in the Donetsk region alone about 200 people have died this year.An explosion rocked an upscale mall in the main financial district of the Philippine capital Manila. The explosion damaged the Glorietta Mall in the financial district of Makati and killed at least eight people and injured at least 126 people, 98 of those needed hospitalization and the other 28 were given first aid at the blast site for minor injuries.The explosion happened past 1:30 p.m. just after employees of the different companies in Makati finished their lunch breaks.Police investigators initially said the cause of the explosion was from a leaking liquefied petroleum gas tank, but after a few hours the Chief of the Philippine National Police, Director General Avelino Razon Jr., ruled out the possibility of a gas tank leak and stated the bomb could be the cause of the explosion because ground investigators say the blast site smelled of gunpowder. Some police intelligence sources say they found traces of C4 explosives at the blast site.Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo meanwhile is on her way to the blast site. Currently, the explosion is still under investigation and the PNP bomb squad are inside the mall to check if there is still any bomb debris or any human remains.Seven people were killed and 37 were injured Saturday night at an Internet cafe in the southwest region of China's Guizhou province, after the explosion of chemicals being stored illegally at a chemical shop. Chinese state media reported that sodium nitrate, aluminum chloride, and other chemicals were being kept in a nearby chemical shop and exploded at about 11:05 pm local time (1505 UTC), causing the Internet cafe to catch on fire. It is unknown how the chemicals ignited.Forty five people were in the cafe when the explosion occurred. Six people died on the scene while one woman suffered major burns and later died in hospital. One person escaped without injury.The police detained the owner of the chemical shop for "illegal possession of chemicals" according to state media. The cafe manager and boss were also placed in police custody for questioning.Xinhua reports that one of the bodies was that of a child. Children under the age of eighteen are not allowed in Internet cafes under Chinese law.According to Li Feiyue of the Qiandongnan Miao-Dong Autonomous Prefecture, "The location and environment of the Internet cafe is not safe. We will find out who approved its operation and who was in charge of safety supervision. They will be held responsible."Residential buildings in the area also suffered damaged.Three people were killed and another three seriously injured in a blast at Mojave Spaceport, located in California, United States. The blast occurred on Thursday at 2:34 p.m. PDT (UTC-7) while Scaled Composites was conducting cold flow test of a rocket engine.According to Tony Diffenbaugh of the Kern County Fire Department, two of the victims died immediately in the blast, while the third succumbed to his injuries at the hospital."Our units arrived on the scene at a remote test site in the northeast portion of the airport. What they found was six victims of an apparent explosion with various traumatic and burn injuries," Diffenbaugh said.Burt Rutan, founder of Scaled Composites, said a press conference: "We just don't know" why the explosion occurred, nitrous oxide usually is "not considered a hazardous material."Scaled Composites is in a partnership with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to build SpaceShipTwo, which hopes to become the first commercially available passenger spaceflight for space tourism.The accident comes just days after Northrop Grumman announced it would increase its stake in Scaled Composites to 100%.A suicide bomber has killed at least 24 people near the Pakistani army headquarters in Rawalpindi when he detonated explosives while riding on a motorbike outside a bank, several hundred metres away from army headquarters. Gunmen had kept up a 24-hour hostage-taking assault last month at those same headquarters. Many people, such as retired and serving military officials, civilians, had come to the bank to collect their salaries, were killed or wounded by the blast. Many hospitals declared emergency services and rushed to help the people out. All schools and colleges around the city were closed.Soon after the bomb blast, military personnel patrolled the road and diverted all the traffic in front of the bank and Shalimar hotel beside it. Most of the people who died were wounded in the blast were mainly military officials.The bomb blast destroyed many window panes in the building and in neighbouring buildings. Raja Sajid, who was an eyewitness to the incident, helped people into the ambulances. Television stations showed ambulances and police vehicles racing to the scene. “I helped the rescuers and put several of them in the ambulances. An old man stained in blood was crying for help," he said.The blast comes as the United Nations announced it was withdrawing its international staff from northwestern Pakistan due to security concerns. Militants carried out several retaliatory attacks last month that killed hundreds of people.Oil and gas pipelines in Mexico were attacked in six different places Monday, forcing the evacuation of approximately 12,000 residents. The six blasts were to reported to have happened at about 2:00 a.m on Monday morning. The company who owns the pipelines, Petroleos Mexicanos, shut down all lines after the attack. No deaths as a result of the explosions were reported, however; the blasts were blamed for the death of two 70 year old women who died from heart attacks. Mexican officials have called the blasts "premeditated" and at least one rebel group (most notably  EPR) has claimed responsibility for the blasts.State media on Saturday reported a war-damaged five-storey block of flats collapsed in a former rebel-held neighbourhood of Aleppo, Syria. The accident in Salaheddin district killed eleven, with a child the sole survivor.The district was recaptured by the state in 2016 following heavy bombing, in an operation supported by Russia. Little reconstruction has taken place, with such reconstruction efforts as have occurred, by the state, focused on infrastructure. According to AFP, other buildings in Salaheddin are similarly close to collapse.Rescuers, some using only their hands, dug out the surviving child. Buildings around the collapsed block bear damage from the ongoing conflict. The survivor was rescued from beneath broken breeze blocks.The United States, which has retreated from a previous goal of ousting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has stated reconstruction will cost between US$300 and 400 billion. The US has further indicated no support will come without political reform in Syria. Satellite imaging from 2017, from the United Nations, suggests Aleppo contained 35,000 war-damaged structures at that time.China, Iran, and Russia have pledged funds and Syria is taxing certain goods toward the cost of reconstruction.At least four people in Peru have contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS after receiving blood transfusions that were infected with the deadly virus.As a result, all of Peru's 240 blood banks have been closed pending further investigation and an emergency has been declared by the government."This situation cannot continue. All of Peru's blood banks are being reviewed. We do not want people to panic, what we have to do is be more careful, strengthen our care," said Carlos Vallejos, the Health Minister of Peru.The country's government made its decision when Judith Rivera, 44 and mother of four children, went public with claims that during an operation, she was infected with HIV when doctors gave her a transfusion. Soon after the government admitted that at least three other individuals, one being an infant child only 11 months old, another a 17 year-old boy, contracted the virus through blood transfusions and all received care from the same hospitals.Vallejos also stated that all of the individuals infected will receive whatever care is necessary to treat their conditions.If you are in the market for new bedding, and not too concerned with the new United States guidelines for mattress fire resistance, now might be a good time to buy. Mattresses sold in the U.S. must meet new federal guidelines for flammability starting on July 1.The flammability of mattress sets sold in the U.S. is subject to a new mandatory federal regulation requirement passed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on February 16 last year. The requirement, costing mattress manufacturers an estimated $100 million to meet, is scheduled to take effect on July 1. The commission anticipates that the new standards will save 270 lives and 1,330 injuries per year from mattress fires."We've passed a new open flame regulation and the whole idea behind the regulation is to make sure that if a mattress catches on fire that the fire burns slowly enough that people have enough time to get out of the house and get away," said Hal Stratton, chairman of the CPSCRadio and TV advertising spots are reacting to the new regulation by discounting prices on mattresses that fail to meet the new guidelines. Sales made in the mattress industry, like the automobile industry, are highly negotiable on price. The new regulation does not appear to have much "teeth" for mattresses already in the distribution pipeline, but it is a new law that is a bargaining position for potential buyers.An F/A-18 Hornet jet belonging to the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels squadron crashed in Beaufort, South Carolina Saturday. The pilot was killed while flying during an air-show at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort. The jet crashed into a neighborhood, sending debris scattering. Eight injuries and property damage were also reported.The crash occurred approximately three miles beyond the air station near Pine Grove and White Pine roads, in Beaufort.According to a Navy news release, the Blue Angels were performing the final maneuver of their routine when the accident occurred. "It was [the pilot's] second year on the team, and first year as a demonstration pilot." said the Navy. "The other five Blue Angel jets were not involved in the incident."The cause of the accident is under investigation, but no other jets are said to be involved. In a news conference, Lt. Commander Anthony Walley said "Our squadron, and the entire U.S. Navy, are grieving the loss of a great American, a great naval officer, and most of all, a great friend." The pilot's name has not officially been released, but it is believed to be Lt. Commander Kevin Davis, 32, from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, as local media reports the number 6 jet was the one that crashed.Two large fires in the New South Wales Blue Mountains, West of Sydney are burning out of control in difficult fire fighting conditions.The first, a 8,000 hectare blaze near Blackheath, which has been burning for nine days broke containment lines at 11 PM AEDT on Monday. Fire crews had been attempting to contain the fire before the onset of difficult conditions today.Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service said fire fighters had made a brave effort to contain the fire. When the fire jumped containment lines, around 95 percent of the fire had been contained."They've worked extremely hard now for six days but probably their most herculean effort was last night," My Koperberg said."They were down on the Grose River working in atrocious conditions as a last-ditch stand ... and they nearly got there."They had several metres still to go when it became too hot and we had to evacuate them because it would have endangered them."A second fire has begun burning on a 5 km (3 mile) front, along the Putty Road near Wiseman's Ferry . It is thought that the fire could affect the village of St Albans.With temperatures in the high 30 degree Celsius range and winds around 50 km/h (31 Mph), fire fighters are bracing for the worst in the Blue Mountains over the next few days. It is feared forecasted wind gusts of up to 80 km/h (49 Mph) overnight could fan the first fire into the township of Winmalee as it heads East.A boat sank in the western Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday, killing at least 73 people, according to reports.The International Committee of the Red Cross says the cargo boat was carrying passengers, as well as logs, when it sank in Lake Mai-Ndombe in the Bandundu province, apparently due to inclement weather. Local reports say the vessel was not authorized to carry passengers.The Red Cross announced 272 people survived the accident, but others remain missing and it is feared their bodies are trapped underneath the sunken barge."We are at 272 survivors and 73 dead. These are bodies that we have found along the shores of the lake. There are still some people missing. But we don't know how many because there was no ship's manifest," said Dominic Lutula, the president of the Congolese Red Cross, said to the Reuters news agency.Boat accidents are fairly common in the Democratic Republic of Congo because vessels are often overloaded and not properly maintained. The country has many rivers but few paved roads, forcing many people to rely on boats for transportation.A boat in Bangladesh sank in a river in the northeastern part of the country earlier today, killing at least a dozen people — including some children — reports say.The incident occurred in the district of Sunamgonj, about 296 kilometers (184 mi) from the capital of Dhaka. The Chinese news service Xinhua reports that the bodies from the ship have been recovered. Government official Babul Miah said the boat was making a trip between villages three kilometres apart. He noted that six of the dead were girls headed to school.At least two dozen other people, however, managed to swim to safety or were rescued after the boat's sinking.  The cause of the accident hasn't yet been ascertained.  An official said that 60–70 people were on board.Nine people are still reported as missing, and according to Miah, searches are underway for them.At least eighty people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are feared dead after a boat capsized on the Congo River.The boat was carrying 125 people when it turned over on Wednesday evening near the city of Kindu, capital of the eastern Maniema province; 45 people have been rescued from the waters, but the rest are missing, and some reports say twenty people were already confirmed dead. Rescue efforts are still ongoing."It was yesterday. It is thought that there could be around 80 dead. There were around 120 people on board," said a spokesman for UN peacekeeping mission in DRC, Madnodje Mounoubai. It wasn't immediately clear why the accident happened; however, boats in the DRC frequently are overcrowded as they are a popular means of transport.A Florida man was killed and another man hospitalized after their boat sank off Cape May, New Jersey, US.The Sea Wolf sent a distress signal via emergency satellite beacon at about 1:35 AM on Thursday, seven miles off Cape May. A member of the State Police informed the Coast Guard who sent out an MH-65 rescue helicopter and two rescue launches.The helicopter managed to save Steve Hopkins of the District of Columbia but was unable to do the same for Gregory Arlotta of Florida. The 62 year old disappeared among the debris in eight-foot waves.Arlotta had recently bought the vessel in New York; its previous owner was in his seventies and had decided to sell the ship. The Sea Wolf had been operating  for a couple of decades prior to the sinking, and was described by one local as unfit for the voyage it was undertaking to New Orleans.  A 1963 Gilligan, it was designed for use within ten miles of shore for fishing.As the National Disaster Coordinating Agency continues to evaluate the reports coming from regions all over the Philippines, bodies of those who drowned or perished while at sea have started to float into the shores of islands in Central Philippines. On Thursday, the Philippines Coast Guard reported that villagers recovered 124 bodies whose identities are still uncertain.Advanced decomposition has made identification difficult for authorities and, fearing a health epidemic, all of the bodies were immediately buried in makeshift graves.The identification of the victims has caused a stir among relatives looking for their missing family members, as forensic investigators were rendered helpless in proceeding to the scattered locations where bodies have been washing ashore.Over 100 divers from the combined Philippines and United States naval forces have been working overtime to retrieve the bodies of passengers trapped inside the capsized MV Princess of the Stars.Disaster management officials in the country announced that the dead from the weekend battering from Typhoon Fengshen could reach to a high of 1,300 people nation-wide. State officials reported that some 2.4 million Filipinos were affected by the disaster, putting property damage at a conservative estimate of $125 million.Relatives of missing passengers were finally brought near the site where the ferry capsized. On board a tug boat, relatives became severely emotional after a Roman Catholic mass was celebrated to commemorate the memory of those lost at sea.Divers from the combined teams of the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard were able to penetrate the interior of the submerged sections of the MV Princess of the Stars.Spokesman for the Navy confirmed fears that there were several passengers of the ill-fated passenger ferry who were trapped when the ferry listed and over turned at around noon of June 22.Lt. Col. Edgard Arevalo of the Navy said that there could have been survivors initially, passengers who were trapped within a pocket of air but the rescue team were only able to reach and enter the ferry, almost three days since it capsized.The length of time for any survivor trapped inside the capsized ship to have breathable air would be limited.Four bodies were retrieved and the team with the help of specialists and salvage teams from the USNS Stockham of the United States Navy, supported by the resources of the US carrier group USS Ronald Reagan will return on Wednesday morning to attempt to stabilize the ship and retrieve more bodies.Philippine authorities are concerned that boring a hole or disturbing the ferry's present location could cause the ship to slide down into deeper waters or cause an environmental damage to the area due to the fuel the ship carries.The ferry capsized some 500 meters off the coast of the town of San Fernando in Romblon province.Toronto, Ontario police are currently investigating human remains encapsulated in concrete from Lake Ontario.  A barrel held the concrete-encased body found offshore at the Toronto waterfront.  The neighbouring area is currently under development for another new city park as the harbourfront is a popular tourist destination.Detective Justin Vander Heyden stated that the barrel holds "a victim of murder, encased in concrete", and that he has "a good idea of who's in the barrel" but conclusive information should be forthcoming by Tuesday from the coroner's office.Ontario provincial police (OPP) are also investigating two other bodies this long weekend in May.  Human remains were found in a construction area near Barrie and a body was also found near Huntsville in a roadside ditch. A firebombing at a Royal Bank of Canada branch in Ottawa has resulted in an urgent call for OPP re-inforcements. Ontario security has been increased in preparation for the June 26-27 G20 summit at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and the G8 summit in Huntsville and the ensuing arrival of international leaders and delegations.A body found in the Cradle Mountain national park on the 2nd of August has yet to be recovered because of rough weather in the winter months. A recovery begun on Thursday the 2 August was discontinued because of unfavourable weather conditions. It is assumed that the body is that of Kasper Sorensen, who went missing on the 5th of July while trying to hike up to the summit. The body was found in an area already searched by rescuers for the tourist, but the area was previously covered in thick snow with heavy storms.Mr Sorensen was a Danish tourist backpacking around Australia as part of a half year round the world holiday.Inspector Brian Edmonds from the Tasmanian Police said to ABC Radio, that when retrieved the body will have to be formally identified by the coroner, but the method of identification will depend on the coroner's decision.Anthony James Creamer's body was found in the Christchurch Avon River on June 6.He was a sickness beneficiary and lived in Avonside Street which is located near the Avon River.Christchurch police Detective Inspector Malcolm Johnston said that there were no suspicious circumstances relating to the death and no suspicious injuries had been identified. However, he said it was still too early to tell the exact cause of death and police could not yet rule out foul play."There is no apparent suspicious injuries, but we will wait for the results of the post-mortem," Johnston said.A member of the public spotted the body tangled in weeds in the middle of the river near Locksley Avenue, in Dallington, about noon. They flagged down a police car and the officer jumped into the river and brought it on to the riverbank. The body was fully clothed and early suggestions were that it had not been there long.The autopsy should be completed by June 7.A body was found in the nose gear of a United Airlines 747 jet from Shanghai, China, which arrived in San Francisco at 7:42 a.m. (PST).According to San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault, the man appeared to be Chinese and in his 50s, and had sustained several injuries prior to his death. Foucrault says that the man could have died from lack of oxygen, hypothermia, or being crushed by the landing gear.The man, currently unidentified, entered the plane's wheel well, and attempted to stowaway, making him the 65th similar stowaway attempt, and the 59th death resulting from the attempts, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.Chilean police confirmed via a DNA test last Sunday that the body found in Chorrillos, Pichilemu was Juanita Carey Moring, daughter of lawyer Guillermo Carey. Mr. Carey along with his wife and four children was caught by the tsunami. After the DNA test was completed, it was also discovered that Juanita's name was written on her undergarments. Her one-year-old  brother, León Carey Moring, is still missing, after being taken by the February 27 tsunami while both children were with their mother.Fishermen in Pichilemu found the body last Sunday evening on the beach of Pichilemu as they roamed around the coastline in Chorrillos at 17:00 (UTC). They immediately called the police.Police did various tests on the body last Monday to try to determine the body's identity and sex. That evening, DNA was taken also from the relatives of other minors who are missing.File:Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.jpgThe body of Emirati Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has been found in a lake near Rabat, Morocco. Sheikh Ahmed had been missing since his glider plane crashed four days ago. Sheikh Ahmed was the managing director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority at the time of his death. He was the son of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and although he was the brother of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed he was not in the immediate line for succession. The Spanish pilot survived the crash and is at the hospital in stable condition. Divers from several countries including Morocco, France, Spain, the United States, and the UAE all helped search for the missing Sheikh. The search had become more complicated after heavy rainfall over the weekend. Sheikh Ahmed’s funeral will be held on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi.At least one person died and five more are injured after a Boeing 737 crashed onto the runway at 1:49 a.m. local time today on San Andres Island, Colombia. The jet, carrying 131 people, broke into three pieces.The AIRES flight departed Bogotá around midnight and, according to Colombian Air Force Colonel David Barrero, officials are investigating reports the aircraft experienced a lightning strike. Of the 125 passengers and six crewmembers, it is believed the only fatality was 65-year-old Amar Fernandez de Barreto. Thaindian claims that up to 114 were injured.San Andres Island's airport has closed its 7,545-foot (2,300-meter) runway until the wreckage can be removed. "It was a miracle and we have to give thanks to God," said Pedro Gallardo, governor of the resort destination island with around 78,000 inhabitants, adding it was lucky there were not more casualties. National police director Orlando Paez in an interview with The Star said a group of police officers awaiting the plane for their own flight back to the mainland assisted with rescue efforts. Barrero commented that "the skill of the pilot kept the plane from colliding with the airport." The landing occurred during a storm.A press release from the US National Transportation Safety Board, seen by Wikinews prior to its public release, identified the flight as number 8250. The NTSB is sending a team of four investigators, as well as technical advisers from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, to assist the Colombia Civil Aviation Authority in their investigation.A Boeing 737 with 69 people on board safely made an emergency landing at Vnukovo Airport in Moscow, Russia, on Saturday, after the crew noticed excessive vibrations in the aircraft's left engine shortly upon takeoff. There were no reports of injuries or damage.The airplane circled around the airport to burn spare fuel in order to make the landing safer, according to Interfax. Fire crews and ambulances were at the scene when the jet landed."After the plane took off, a vibration of the left engine was detected, after which it was decided to return back to Vnukovo," ((Translated from Russian))Russian language: ‍После взлета была обнаружена вибрация левого двигателя, после чего было принято решение о возвращении самолета обратно во Внуково a spokesperson for the airport told Interfax. "The airplane made an emergency landing. None of the 69 people on board were hurt." ((ru))Russian language: ‍Самолет совершил аварийную посадку. Никто из находившихся на борту 69 человек не пострадалThe plane had taken off from Vnukovo and was en route to Sochi on the Black Sea.The aircraft involved in the incident was a Sky Express Boeing 737-500, flight XW-229.A Boeing 747-200 cargo aircraft operated by Kalitta Air has crashed near Bogotá in Colombia, killing three people on the ground after it hit their house. It seems that fire in one of four engines of the 747 caused the accident, just after taking off from El Dorado International Airport for a flight to Miami.The plane, which was carrying flowers, had declared an emergency two minutes after take-off and was said to be attempting to return to the airport when it crashed at 3:55 am local time. All eight crew survived but some were injured and were rushed to hospital in the nearby town of Madrid. The crash is the second involving a Kalitta Air 747 in two months. In May another of the company's 747s crashed whilst attempting to take-off at an airport in Belgium.A Boeing 747 cargo plane has broken in two after crashing off the end of the runway at Brussels Airport near Zaventem, Belgium. Some reports say four of the five crew were slightly injured when the Kallita Air jumbo jet failed to takeoff on a flight to Bahrain, but others state no injuries.Press images show the aircraft, which did not catch fire, broken immediately behind the wings, with the forward section level and the front end of the back section raised in the air. The right hand door has been opened and the emergency evacuation slide deployed by the crew, one of whom is in a state of shock. The area around the plane's wings was doused with specialist fire retardant foam as the tanks were full of fuel for the journey.The force of the crash at 1:30 p.m. local time today sent the plane 300 meters beyond the end of the runway. Air operations have continued as normal on the airport's two other runways,  but a nearby railway line is closed. Reports of the cargo on board vary, with one news agency reporting 70 tons of diplomatic mail, batteries and a car, while other reports state 76 tons of unspecified cargo.It is unclear what caused the accident, but the pilot reported hearing a loud noise as the aircraft attempted to takeoff. Weather conditions were clear, and the airport had seen some light rain in earlier this morning.Kalitta is a United States based carrier founded in 2000 by Conrad Kalitta with three 747s and now owns 18 including the one involved in today's accident.A Boeing 757 passenger jet, operated by Yakutia airlines, successfully made an emergency landing at the Vnukovo airport in the Russian capital of Moscow on Tuesday. The plane requested the landing after technical problems were reported on board. None of the 174 passengers and nine crew members aboard were injured."The airplane took off from Vnukovo airport, en route to Yakutsk. After some time, some technical difficulties started, due to which the crew made a decision to return to the airport," ((Translated from Russian))Russian language: ‍Самолет вылетел из "Внуково" в Якутск, однако через некоторое время появились какие-то технические неполадки, из-за чего экипаж принял решение вернуться обратно во "Внуково" said a spokeswoman for Vnukovo airport. The plane was originally scheduled to land at 20:20 local time, but circled around the airport in a holding pattern for three and a half hours to burn off excess fuel.Yakutia Flight 478 departed from Vnukovo at 17:26 local time. Twenty minutes after takeoff, at  17:46, the captain of the airplane reported technical troubles. He then decided to return to Vnukovo and land the plane. Reports suggest that the cabin depressurized while the jet was climbing to cruising altitude.This incident occurred only a few days after Sky Express Flight 229, a Boeing 737, had to perform a similar landing shortly after takeoff, though no reports have indicated the two incidents are related.A Boeing 767 cargo jetliner (tail number: N799AX) has been seriously damaged by a fire that broke out Saturday evening shortly after 22:00 PDT (UTC-7). It took two hours to extinguish the fire on board the Airborne Express aircraft, which was parked at a mail processing area of San Francisco International Airport in California, United States.Airborne Express Flight 1611 had arrived earlier and since then was parked at an area that a Federal Aviation Administration described as "far away from regular traffic," known as Plot No. 11. The fire broke out behind the cockpit, which contained two pilots at the time who were able to escape the fire.Roads around the airport were closed for ten minutes while crews responded, and 100 people were evacuated from a nearby building. The fire was described as intense and producing thick amounts of black smoke. Airport Duty Manager Lilly Wang said of the damage, "You can actually see through the top of the aircraft. It spread all the way through."An investigation into the cause is underway. It is unclear if there was cargo on board at the time. No injuries were reported.On Monday, November 27, 2006 the Medical Health Officers of the Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health recommended that the boil water advisory that had been in effect for the City of Vancouver, North Vancouver, and Burnaby could now be lifted. Hospitals, care facilities, schools, food premises and the public are no longer being advised to boil drinking water or to use an alternate drinking water source. The boil water advisory for the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) had been lifted days before but had remained in effect for the listed areas. Turbidity is on a downward trend but still remains above pre-storm levels. Water may continue to appear cloudy or discoloured for some time. The Medical Health Officers, monitoring and testing the water, at no point found the water un-safe, but felt the boil water advisory was justified as a safety precauction. It has been advised that people with comprised immune systems should continue to boil drinking water or drink filtered water.A road crash in Bolivia has left at least 47 people dead. It is unclear if the vehicle was a bus or a truck with passengers on its back, but it is known it lost control on a mountainous South Bolivian road and fell 200 metres down a cliff.The accident occurred near Potosi, a mining town. "The truck was loaded with 60 people who were sitting on top of their loads, which crushed them when the truck fell," according to Erbol radio station, while BBC News Online has an image showing debris that appears to be a shed load from a truck, but not of the actual vehicle for confirmation.Local police say they have identified 41 dead and released their names, but six further bodies remain to be identified. At least twelve of the deceased are children, and at least eleven people are injured.There is no official word regarding the disaster's cause, but local witnesses have claimed to reporters that the vehicle was traveling at excessive speed.Multiple bomb explosions hit a football match in northern Iraq earlier today, killing at least 25 people and injuring at least 120 more.The incident occurred in Tal Afar, a town located approximately sixty kilometres west of Mosul.

[...] This was a terrorist attack.  It was a deliberate, calculated attack to inflict maximum damage."Felix Kulaije, an army spokesperson, suggested that the Somali rebel group al-Shabaab might be behind the attacks, saying that "[w]e suspect it's al-Shabaab because they've been promising this for [a] long [time]."An unnamed commander for al-Shabaab spoke to the Associated Press earlier today regarding the incident. Although he didn't indicate whether his group was responsible for the attacks or not, he said he was happy the bombings took place, saying: "Uganda is one of our enemies. Whatever makes them cry, makes us happy."If the group did indeed organize the bombings, then it would be the first time they had conducted attacks outside Somalia. Somali rebels have previously threatened to attack the Ugandan capital.Five bombs went off nearly simutaneously in three Indian cities in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Court houses in Lucknow, Varanasi and Faizabad were rocked. The attack on the justice system killed 13 people and injured another 61."These are all soft targets. Weapons and explosives are no more a challenge for these groupings," said Ajai Sahni, an executive director of the New Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management. "Uttar Pradesh has long been a target because it's a poorly administered state and a poor state."Police in New Delhi have increased security at bus stands, airports, shopping areas and railway stations.

The blast wounded dozens of people and destroyed several buildings."The death toll has gone up to 32 and more than 100 people have been wounded in this suicide attack," said Bashir Bilour, the Senior Minister of North West Frontier Province. Hazrat Ali, a shopkeeper, was a witness to the event. He recounted his experiences to the Agence France-Presse news agency. "I was buying something before closing my shop. A car was parked on the other side of the road and all of a sudden there was a huge blast. There was smoke and darkness everywhere. I passed out." Ali sustained shrapnel injuries to his forehead and torso.This was the third bombing in the area in three days. On Monday, a suicide bomber in a rickshaw blew himself up at a checkpoint in Peshawar, killing three people. A suicide bomber killed thirteen people in a crowded market outside the city on Sunday.An explosion today in Makhachkala, Russia in the Russian region of Dagestan killed one and wounded five others, police say. The bomb detonated in a pile of garbage, where servicemen and a truck had been sent to search for explosives on a street near a military base. When the engineers got out of the truck to search, the bomb went off.The Dagestani Ministry, reported by the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass, originally stated that the blast killed two servicemen and wounded three others. They later revised this to six servicemen wounded (as well as one civilian), but no fatalities. A police officer told ITAR-Tass news that a brigade had been on patrol when the explosion occurred.According to RIA-Novosti and Interfax news, medics reported one death and six injuries. RIA-Novosti also reports that the bomb exploded near a trolley bus. Police and ambulances were immediately brought to the area of the explosion, which was quickly sealed off by police. The alleged planters of the bomb were followed by police, but escaped after firing at the officers. This explosion is not surprising, as racial tensions in the Muslim majority region of Dagestan often lead to attacks on officials and police.A bomb has been ruled out in the crash of a government-owned Learjet L45 in Mexico City, Mexico on Friday, killing all nine on board and five on the ground. There have been rumours that the crash was deliberate as two prominent politicians, interior minister Juan Camilo Mourino and leading anti-drug advisor Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos were aboard.Investigators have also confirmed both engines were still functioning upon impact and that there was no fire, structural failure or evidence of malfunction prior to impact, suggesting a loss of control may be to blame. The aircraft should have been headed East towards Mexico City International Airport, but was instead travelling roughly Northbound when the crash occurred.It is unknown why this occurred, but the investigation, which includes a team from the United States led by the National Transportation Safety Board, is looking at the possibility turbulence from another aircraft caused the plane to become uncontrollable. It was travelling at 300 mph (500 kph) when it struck cars moving through the city.Investigation head Gilberto Lopez said of the findings "this clearly proves what we had believed, that there was an abrupt loss of control," while Transportation Secretary Luis Téllez said they “strengthen the hypothesis that this was an accident.”The Police sealed off Princes St while the bomb squad performed a controlled explosion on board an Edinburgh double-decker bus, following reports of a suspicious package on board. A block of Princes street was closed to the public from approximately 17:30, while investigations were carried out. Later a second controlled explosion was carried out in a store at the east end of Princes St.All local shops and homes were evacuated, and as of 20:30 remained unable to access their property while continuing evaluation of the scene was carried out. Traffic approaching the area was diverted, and motorists urged to stay away from the area unless essential.Following earlier blasts in London the Police treated the situation very seriously, but it later emerged to be a false alarm. The blockade follows several days of planned closures for marches surrounding the Make Poverty History and G8 conference.Wikinews has learned that Argentine media reported on May 27 that an Air France flight traveling from Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina to Paris, France, was delayed after the airline reportedly received a bomb threat, just days before Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.According to momento24, on May 27, authorities boarded Air France Flight 415, a Boeing 777 en route to Paris and searched the plane for a bomb, but found nothing. They were acting on a threat that had been phoned in. The search lasted for nearly two hours and none of the passengers were evacuated from the aircraft. Air France issued a statement saying the threat was later proven to be "false" and that the plane had only taken 32 minutes to search, and was then allowed to proceed to its destination."We have no signs so far," that the cause of the crash is related to terrorism, said Herve Morin, France's minister of defense in an address on Europe 1 Radio. He also added that "we can’t rule out a terrorist act since terrorism is the main threat to Western democracies." Argentinian police say that there is no known link between the two events.Air France Flight 447 was an Airbus A330 en route from Rio de Janerio to Paris on June 1, with 228 people on board, when it vanished from radar screens after entering an area with severe turbulence. The exact cause is still under investigation.On June 2, wreckage from the plane was spotted in the Atlantic Ocean 650 kilometres from the coast of Brazil. An airplane seat and life vest were found floating in Atlantic waters on Tuesday. A French ship arrived at the area on the same day, and confirmed the debris.All on board the aircraft are feared to have been killed in the crash. The main goal for search crews will be to find the cockpit voice and data recorder to help find out what caused the crash. French authorities have sent a vessel carrying two mini-submarines to attempt recovery of the flight data recorders, which can broadcast locator signals for up to 30 days.  However, the Brazilian defence minister said on Tuesday that it may be hard to find them due to the depth of the ocean in the area, saying that "it could be at a depth of 2,000 or 3,000 metres [6,500 to 9,800 feet] in that area of the ocean."Multiple car bombs in Iraq's capital of Baghdad have killed at least 58 and wounded a further hundred. Some media reports put the death toll as high as 69.Most of the explosions took place near Shia mosques during prayers; the deadliest attacks, meanwhile, were in Sadr City. There were at least six total bombings, although some reports put the figure as high as thirteen.Baghdad security spokesman Qassim Moussawi told Reuters news agency the bombings targeted "prayers in areas with a certain majority", referring to Iraq's Shia population.A top official accused al-Qaeda as being responsible for the attacks. Meanwhile, Qassim Moussawi, a security spokesman in the capital, said to Reuters that the blasts were "revenge for the losses suffered by al-Qaeda", adding that he believed "such terrorist acts" will continue.Iraqi police say three blasts in Baghdad killed four people and wounded fourteen others on Tuesday. Three other blasts also rocked the northern city of Mosul on the same day, killing and wounding several dozen people. The explosions came as politicians continue to debate over who was responsible for the last wave of bombings, which happened exactly one week ago.The Baghdad explosions struck at the Iraqi government's nerve center, near the heavily fortified Green Zone. Baghdad's security chief, General Qassem Mohammed Atta, reported that three explosive devices hidden in civilian vehicles blew up in parking lots in the Karrada District, close to the Green Zone. He noted that a fourth explosive device, hidden in a parked vehicle near the Iranian Embassy, was found and disabled.The explosions were in the immediate vicinity of Iraq's Foreign Ministry building, which is covered by a gigantic Iraqi flag on one side, as repairs continue on the structure that was gutted by a massive car-bomb explosion on August 16.Mortar attacks and assassination attempts against several Iraqi politicians were also reported elsewhere in Baghdad.Meanwhile, the attacks in Mosul killed four people and wounded a further forty. They seemed to target a mosque and a neighbourhood, according to the Kurdish Globe, according to an unnamed doctor at a Mosul hospital.No group has yet claimed responsibility for the bombings.Iraqi police say a series of car bombings across the capital, Baghdad, killed at least 127 people, wounding hundreds of others.Reports say three of today's blasts were coordinated. The first occurred at 10:25 local time (07:25 GMT), the others following within minutes. One of the bombs targeted the busy Shourja Market in central Baghdad, near to the Iraqi health ministry. The others were detonated near the Interior Ministry in eastern Baghdad and the Labor Ministry.Police say that earlier, a suicide car bomber struck a police patrol in Dora, southern Baghdad, killing three policemen and twelve students at a local college. Another explosion in central Baghdad has also been reported.The attacks come just two days after the Iraqi parliament passed a law vital for elections to be held early next year. Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, a former Iraqi security adviser, blamed al-Qaeda, saying they have been active in Baghdad recently and are trying to destabilize the government before elections."The aim is to show the government is unable to protect civilian[s] and its own people and also to deter people from going to ballot boxes," al-Rubaie said.Tuesday's attacks were the worst in the Iraqi capital since late October when twin bomb attacks outside municipal offices killed at least 155 people.Twin bombings yesterday struck the Jolo Cathedral in Mindanao, Philippines. The second blast affected first responders following the first; between the two blasts, at least 20 were killed.According to Chief Superintendent Graciano Mijares of the police of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, the confirmed deaths are fourteen civilians, five Armed Forces personnel, and one member of the Coast Guard. This revised downwards an earlier toll of 27 dead. Mijares further claimed 90 civilians were wounded, as were seventeen from the Armed Forces, and two each from the Coast Guard and the National Police. Some victims were airlifted to nearby Zamboanga."We will use the full force of the law to bring to justice the perpetrators behind this incident," said Delfin Lorenzana, the Defence Secretary; he described the attacks as a "dastardly act" and urged vigilant locals to assist authorities and "deny terrorism any victory". The first bomb went off within the Roman Catholic cathedral; the second in its car park. Lorenzana said he had ordered 'heightened alert' from troops, and that the army protect places of worship.The Philippines is a Catholic majority nation. This week saw a referendum seeking to create a new autonomous, self-administered region in Muslim-majority Mindanao, potentially ending decades of conflict with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Of the 2.8 million who voted, 85% were in favour and on Friday the government announced the new region, to be called Bangsamoro, would be governing itself from 2022. Jolo, and the Sulu region it is within, were among the areas to vote against the measure. Bangsamoro is nevertheless to include them within it.Arnel dela Vega of the army's Western Mindanao Command said the Abu Sayyaf Group are the suspected perpetrators. The first bomb went off during Mass; video footage from the scene shows wooden pews broken and scattered within the building. Regional Governor Mujiv Hataman agreed, saying only this organisation appeared capable of the double bombing. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which is linked to the Abu Sayyaf Group, subsequently claimed responsibility.The Coast Guard said their casualties were attending mass. The deceased seaman was identified as Jaypee Galicha by a Coast Guard spokesperson. The Coast Guard has announced an order by Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Elson Hermogino directing Coast Guard units nearby to "join personnel from the [army and police] in the investigation and pursuit of the perpetrators."Statements of condemnation have come from Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) head Yousef Al-Othaimeen, Pope Francis, and a spokesperson for President Rodrigo Duterte. The OIC is the largest group representing nations with mainly Muslim populations.At least three people died today and seventeen more were injured after a road bridge collapsed on the Indonesian island of Borneo. At least three cars, several motorbikes, and a public bus all fell into the Mahakam River.The bridge was constructed from concrete roughly a decade ago to resemble California's Golden Gate Bridge, and links the East Kalimantan towns of Tenggarong and Samarinda. Police say there is no indication of why it failed. Completed in 2001, work started in 1995 and locals called it "Kalimantan's Golden Gate Bridge."The wounded have been hospitalised, some with broken bones. The scene at the bridge, in Kutai Kartanegara district, was filled with screams in the aftermath of the collapse. The suspension bridge was erected by state-owned builders PT Hutama Karya and one segment has fallen into the water. Some vehicles are close to entirely submerged, and Indonesia Today suggests as many as 100 people may be injured. One damaged car was left inverted and suspended above the water.Harmoni Adi, head of a search and rescue agency, said "[t]he death toll is likely to increase," after the 4:30pm local time collapse, with rescuers in Tenggarong searching the river for survivors. Some people swam ashore after falling from the structure, which spanned 700 metres. An eyewitness described heavy traffic on the bridge when it came down.The death toll from yesterday's suspension bridge collapse on the Indonesian island of Borneo has risen from three to four, with a six-month-old baby among the dead. Search and rescue teams continue to look for survivors in the Mahakam River.The initial death toll was raised at first to five, but was revised back down to four. The number of wounded rose from at least seventeen to at least nineteen, but Monsters and Critics offers a figure as high as 39 injured; Indonesia Today yesterday suggested the actual figure was 100 hospitalised. Roughly 40 people remain missing at the scene in East Kalimantan's Kutai Kartanegara district, where "Kalimantan's Golden Gate Bridge" linked the towns of Tenggarong and Samarinda.At least three cars, several motorbikes, and at least one public bus all fell into the Mahakam River. Another car was left overturned and balanced upon wreckage over the water. State-owned builders PT Hutama Karya completed the bridge about a decade ago in the image of California's Golden Gate Bridge, and it is now reported it was under repair at the time of the failure. New information suggests a cable on the 720-metre structure failed as workers dealt with it; six of the repair crew are among the missing.National police representative Boy Rafly Amar said "It is believed that some victims are still in the river. There are two buses in the river and efforts are under way to lift them." He said 39 were rescued with 20 still in hospital. Health Minister Endang Rahayu Sedyaningsih visited survivors in Parikesit Hospital and promised them medical treatment at government expense."It happened so fast, only about 30 seconds," according to National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Nugoroho. National search and rescue head Daryatmo said Monday will see cranes attempt to move debris.The president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has sent three ministers to the site to investigate the accident, while Bambang Widaryatmo, head of East Kalimantan's police, promised "parties found to be negligent will be prosecuted". The government has promised a replacement ferry service. The river is closed to boats as rescue operations continue, and a 22-strong team has been dispatched from the national police, comprising six forensics experts, five disaster victim identification specialists, and eleven investigators. They are there to augment the East Kalimantan Police.Some people swam ashore after falling, with the aftermath filled with screams. 40-year-old Adam Nur describes breaking free from a car and swimming 300 metres with one arm after his other arm was injured in the fall. Syakrani, 24, says he survived by clinging to empty plastic containers when he fell from the bridge after leaving his truck to investigate a traffic jam. "The authorities should have closed the bridge if it was under repair," he said.Last weekend, an eight-year-old boy died after falling into the River Wharfe in North Yorkshire, England. The river is known for its depth and strong undercurrent. The accident took place on Aaron Page's birthday, following celebrations with over twenty family members.Page made his way to the river near Skipton around 3pm BST (1400 UTC) on Saturday; his brother, aged thirteen, was the first to call for assistance after spotting Aaron in the water. Emergency services subsequently assisted in searching for Aaron; the body was recovered at approximately 6:25 pm the same day. Members of the ambulance service failed to resuscitate him, pronouncing him dead at the scene."This was a happy family day out to celebrate a birthday at a local beauty spot [...] and unfortunately this young boy has got into difficulty in an area of water," stated Inspector Kevin Franks of North Yorkshire Police. "Despite efforts from members of the public and some quite sterling efforts from the emergency services and everyone else there, sadly we've been unable to bring him out alive." Inspector Mike Woodhall of Harrogate police cautioned; "[n]o matter how safe a river seems sometimes there are inherent dangers."The attack, which occurred off northern New South Wales, Australia, was the first fatality from a shark attack in the area for over two years. There have, however been many more attacks which have not resulted in deaths.It is unusual for sharks to attack humans. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), attacks on humans are normally a result of mistakes by the shark. The NOAA also says that sharks sometimes mistake humans for its natural prey, such as fish or a marine mammal or sea turtle, and that sharks most often will release the person after the first bite. It has also been claimed that the majority of shark bites are "hit-and-run" attacks by smaller species, such as blacktip and spinner sharks.Oil company BP has reportedly lost a laptop containing the personal information of approximately 13,000 people who filed claims against the company following the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year.Tom Mueller, a spokesperson for the company, confirmed they had written to "individuals impacted by this event to inform them about the loss of their personal data and to offer them free credit monitoring services to help protect their personal information." Mueller said the laptop was lost during "routine business travel," and was reported to have the ability to be deactivated remotely.BP refused to comment about the employee who lost the laptop. The data on the laptop contained the names, addresses, Social Security numbers, phone numbers and the dates of birth of claimants, which was unencrypted even though the laptop itself is protected by a password.The data on the laptop concerned claimants against the company after one of its oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, sending up to 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean, which eventually reached the southern U.S. coastline. One resident affected by the the oil disaster and the lost laptop expressed his outrage at BP when interviewed by NPR. "It's terrible, I kinda work hard for the things I have," he said. "I wouldn't want somebody with a computer to be able to take it from me. It's very disturbing. It's like another gallon of gas thrown on the fire."BP released their report into the causes of the Deepwater Horizon disaster earlier this year on Wednesday, and shifted much of the blame for the explosion and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, onto Transocean, the company managing the rig. The report concludes by stating that decisions made by "multiple companies and work teams" contributed to the accident which it says arose from "a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces." The report, the product of a four-month investigation conducted by BP's Head of Safety Operations, Mark Bly, criticizes the oil rig's fire prevention systems, the crew of the rig for failing to realize and act upon evidence that oil was leaking from the surface of the ocean, and describes how BP and Transocean "incorrectly accepted" negative pressure test results. The document goes on to note that the blow-out preventer failed to operate, likely because critical components were not operational.Bob Dudley, who will become chief executive of BP, described the accident as "tragic". He said, "we have said from the beginning that the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon was a shared responsibility among many entities. This report makes that conclusion even clearer, presenting a detailed analysis of the facts and recommendations for improvement both for BP and the other parties involved. We have accepted all the recommendations and are examining how best to implement them across our drilling operations worldwide." The report included 25 recommendations, according to a press release, "designed to prevent a recurrence of such an accident." The oil company has previously blamed Transocean and Halliburton, the well contractor, for the disaster and BP executives feel they have been unfairly blamed by US politicians for the disaster, and the report continues this view.Tony Hayward, who was fired from the position of BP's chief executive following multiple public relations issues, squarley places the blame for the disaster on Halliburton. "To put it simply, there was a bad cement job," he said in a statement, also claiming that BP should not be the only company to take the blame for the explosion. "It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident," he argues. The report blames the type of cement used by Halliburton, designed to prevent harmful hydrocarbons from reaching the seabed, as well as criticizing the crew of Deepwater Horizon, for failing to realize for forty minutes that oil had started to leak from the well, and once it was realized, the crew "vented" the hydrocarbons "directly onto the rig". Describing how the explosion, which killed eleven rig personnel, occurred, the report states that "the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system probably transferred a gas-rich mixture into the engine rooms," where the hydrocarbons ignited and a fireball engulfed the rig. But, the report states, the blowout preventer, the ultimate failsafe on the Deepwater Horizon failed, likely due to the fire on the rig. An automated system was not operational because the batteries powering it, located in a control pod, had gone flat, and another control pod contained a faulty solenoid valve. The report was likely, however, written with the company's legal liability for the disaster in a prominent position, since they are facing hundreds of lawsuits and criminal charges as a result of the spill. The executive summary is four and a half pages long and the first page is made up entirely of legal disclaimers saying if BP was found to be negligent in their operations of the rig, they could be fined a good deal more. Questions have also been raised as to why BP has chosen to release their report before authorities examine the blowout preventer. The energy editor of The Guardian, Terry Macalister, wrote that the "catalougue of errors - both human and mechanical" in the report "demolish" the oil industry's "much quoted mantra" of safety first. "It may come first in the board room but it does not down at the wellhead where the real dangers are faced," he wrote. "It is worth remembering that BP, its rig operator Transocean and the main well contractor Halliburton are the blue chip companies in the wider oil and gas sector. If the shoddy work practices highlighted here are what the best-in-class do, then what is happening in the lower reaches of this industry?"Transocean described the report as a "self-serving" attempt to "conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident: BP's fatally flawed well design. In both its design and construction, BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk – in some cases, severely." In a statement, the company listed five issues they felt had contributed to the disaster that were no fault but BP's. "Transocean's investigation is ongoing, and will be concluded when all of the evidence is in, including the critical information the company has requested of BP but has yet to receive." Members of Congress, who are also carrying out a review into the disaster, also dismissed the report. Ed Markey, the Massachusetts democrat who has been investigating the spill in Congress, said that he felt the report was simply a lengthy defense of the oil company's handling of the spill. "BP is happy to slice up blame, as long as they get the smallest piece," he said.Bly acknowledged during a press conference in Washington that the report did not detail the charges raised against the company in Congress and that BP permitted a culture of recklessness to flourish. He did, however, reject suggestions that cost-cutting had put lives at risk and the rig was a disaster waiting to happen. "What we see instead is, where there were errors made they were based on poor decision-making process or using wrong information," he said. The Guardian reported that "the report is narrowly focused on the final days before the explosion rather than on earlier decisions about well design and safety procedures. It is also closely focused on the rig itself. No BP officials have been sacked for their role in the explosion, and Bly said there was no indication of any blame beyond the well-site managers."The Associated Press reported that Bly "said at a briefing in Washington that the internal report was a reconstruction of what happened on the rig based on the company's data and interviews with mostly BP employees and was not meant to focus on assigning blame. The six-person investigating panel only had access to a few workers from other companies, and samples of the actual cement used in the well were not released." The report continued, "Steve Yerrid, special counsel on the oil spill for Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, said the report clearly shows the company is attempting to spread blame for the well disaster, foreshadowing what will be a likely legal effort to force Halliburton and Transocean, and perhaps others, to share costs such as paying claims and government penalties."Head of Greenpeace's energy campaign Jim Footner said that it was "highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP." However, he said, "the real problem is our addiction to oil, which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk. The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now. The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy." Alfred R Sunsen, whose oyster company operating in the Gulf of Mexico is facing the prospect of going out of business after 134 years, reacted angrily the the report. "The report does not address the people, businesses, animals, or natural resources that have been impacted by the disaster and will be dealing with the consequences of their inadequate and slow response to the disaster," he said. The New York Times said that the report is "unlikely to carry much weight in influencing the Department of Justice, which is considering criminal and civil charges related to the spill," and described it as "a public relations exercise" and a "probable legal strategy as it prepares to defend itself against possible federal charges, penalties and hundreds of pending lawsuits."Wayne Pennington, head of the geological engineering department at Michigan Technical University, also alleged that BP was wrong to blame other parties involved with the disaster. "The blowout and subsequent explosion and spillage appear to the result of an overall attitude that encouraged unwarranted optimism in the quality of each component of the job, allowing the omission of standard testing procedures, and the misinterpretation of other tests in the most-favorable light." He continued: "Instead, skepticism should reign on any drilling job, and testing and evaluation at each stage of the drilling and completion would then be routine; instead of questioning the need for such things as the cement bond log, the companies involved should insist on checking and double-checking quality at each step of the process. This was clearly not done, repeatedly, in the case of the Macondo well, and disaster resulted."4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, causing damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries. Extensive measures were used to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline of Louisiana, including skimmer ships, floating containment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades. Scientists have also reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil not visible at the surface. The U.S. Government has named BP as the responsible party, and officials have committed to holding the company accountable for all cleanup costs and other damage.Dudley went on to say that BP "deeply regret" the disaster. "We have sought throughout to step up to our responsibilities. We are determined to learn the lessons for the future and we will be undertaking a broad-scale review to further improve the safety of our operations. We will invest whatever it takes to achieve that. It will be incumbent on everyone at BP to embrace and implement the changes necessary to ensure that a tragedy like this can never happen again."BP reported Tuesday that it captured nearly 25,000 barrels of crude oil on Monday from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The energy company also reported that a third of the oil captured was subsequently burned off. This indicates that the oil spill recovery operations may have begun to stabilize, even as strong storms threaten to hinder efforts.As of July 5, BP has collected about 657,300 barrels of oil, with an estimated flow rate of about 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day. As recovery efforts progress, responders hope to increase these efforts by bringing in additional ships to raise the average oil capture rate to 53,000 barrels per day. However, this latest effort was delayed by the recent Hurricane Alex, bringing operations to a halt for three days. BP plans to expand its containment capacity and flexibility, which is anticipated to occur during mid to late July. It is planned that several oil containment systems will be deployed; however, the efficiency of these systems cannot be guaranteed, as they have not been tested in the conditions they are expected to operate in. Work on the first two relief wells, which began in May, continues and is expected to take a total of about three months.The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is the worst offshore oil spill in United States history, and BP reports that recovery operations thus far have amounted to a total of about US$3.12 billion. The spill began in April when a drilling rig, the Deepwater Horizon, exploded and subsequently sank, killing eleven.For the first time since April 20, no oil is flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, though the halt may be temporary, as integrity testing began on a new sealing cap. The cap was installed on a leaking well in an effort by the BP energy company to contain oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico. The previous containment cap, which was removed Saturday, had a much looser fit than the new one and allowed oil to escape into the Gulf. It took about three days for the cap to be removed, the site prepared, and the new one to be slowly lowered into position.The energy company had planned to begin running integrity tests Tuesday to measure the performance of the well under pressure.  The tests were delayed a day for further analysis, but clearance to proceed was given Wednesday afternoon, then a leak in a choke line had to be repaired. BP senior vice president Kent Wells announced at his Thursday afternoon briefing that the final valve on the cap assembly started to close at 1:15 PM Thursday and was fully closed at 2:25 PM, finally shutting in the oil flow. If the tests show that the well is strong enough, the sealing cap valves will likely remain closed. If the well cannot be safely closed from the top, the new cap is designed to funnel almost all the oil to ships above while two relief wells are constructed for a permanent fix. After the old cap was removed, oil flowed freely into the waters of the Gulf until the present cap was installed at about 7:00 PM CDT Monday (00:00 UTC Tuesday).BP has stated that this oil containment system has never been deployed at the current depths, nor has it been tested in the conditions that it will be expected to operate in. During the testing period, which could last anywhere from six to forty-eight hours, all undersea oil containment systems will be temporarily suspended. The company made clear that, even if the tests succeed, this does not mean that oil leakage has permanently ceased. Doug Suttles, a BP executive, explained that during the test, the well pressure will be carefully monitored. Suttles said at a Monday briefing that the ideal would be for tests to show high pressure around the seal, indicating that no oil is escaping. He also stated that on the other hand, the pressures could be lower than anticipated, leading to the assumption that the well is damaged and is leaking oil and gas into surrounding rock. If this were to happen, keeping the cap shut could further damage the well. The solution for this scenario is to reopen the valves and funnel most, if not all, of the oil to ships above.Drilling of the first relief well was suspended until completion of the integrity test. Kent Wells explained at his Wednesday morning briefing that the first relief well is now 4 feet from the original well and there is a remote possibility that the pressure test could open a path to the relief well. Drilling of the second relief well has stopped at 16,000 feet so as not to interfere with the first well and to keep routing options open in case the first relief well fails. Even if the pressure tests do succeed and the main well is shut, work on the first relief well will continue until it intercepts the main well. When this occurs, mud and cement will be pumped into the well for a permanent seal. Containment and clean up operations will continue even after the relief wells are finished to deal with oil already released.The Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing eleven and marking the start of the worst offshore oil spill in United States history.The oil company BP has said that one of three leaks from a ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been sealed off, in an attempt to stop the oil from the destroyed Deepwater Horizon rig from contaminating the sea further.Although 800,000 litres of oil a day are still pouring into the sea, officials say it will be easier to combat the spill with only two leaks."As we speak today we now only have two leak sources but I would stress the amount of oil being leaked is still the same," commented BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles.Meanwhile, remote-controlled submarines will be used tomorrow to try to place a large iron dome over the other two leaks, according to BP spokesman John Curry.The Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20, killing eleven workers; the cause of the disaster is not known.The top kill procedure implemented by BP on the leaking Deepwater Horizon oil well on Wednesday has failed. According to David Suttles, BP's chief operating officer, "We have been unable to overcome the flow." Suttles stated that after studying three days of results, BP determined that the procedure was a failure.On Wednesday, BP began pumping mud into the leaking well, a procedure known as top kill.  BP chief executive Tony Howard said it would take at least 24 hours to determine if the procedure was successful.  The procedure has worked before in surface situations, but was not previously attempted at 5,000 feet underwater.The procedure involves pumping heavyweight drilling mud from the surface through a drill pipe, which directs the mud into a manifold lying on the sea bed. From the manifold, the mud is pumped into the blowout preventer, which is sitting on the well.BP says it pumped 30,000 barrels of mud into the well at rates of up to 80 barrels a minute. After three attempts, the well was still leaking. The next option, the sixth, is called the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) Cap containment system. This procedure involves a ROV using a saw to cut off the leaking pipe and place a cap on the pipe. The LMRP Cap is at the scene and the procedure is expected to take four days to complete.In New Orleans hundreds gathered in protest, calling for a fast stop to the spill and greater efforts to mitigate its ecological and economic effects.The usually inhibited desert locust Schistocerca gregaria, which wiles away the months as a solitary, insignificant grasshopper can shift into horrifying swarms due to a chemical commonly found in people’s brain, a research showed. The solitary and gregarious phases of locusts are so different that they were considered distinct species until 1921.  Scientists have known for several years that touching a solitary desert locust on the hind legs, or allowing it to see or smell other locusts, is enough to transform it into the gregarious phase. This week, Science magazine published strong scientific evidence that the behavioural and physical makeover is effected by serotonin, a carrier of nerve signals in virtually all animals.Researchers from the University of Sydney, University of Oxford, and University of Cambridge have pinpointed a single neurochemical - serotonin - as the cause of an instinctive behavioural change from the locusts' solitarious phase to become gregarious and form disastrous swarms of millions. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesized in serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract of animals including humans. Serotonin is also found in many mushrooms and plants, including fruits and vegetables.In the central nervous system, serotonin plays an important role as a neurotransmitter in the modulation of anger, aggression, body temperature, mood, sleep, human sexuality, appetite, metabolism, as well as stimulating vomiting. Keeping serotonin levels high is the aim of many anti-depressant drugs. "Serotonin profoundly influences how we humans behave and interact," said co-author Dr Swidbert Ott, from Cambridge University. "So to find that the same chemical is what causes a normally shy, antisocial insect to gang up in huge groups is amazing," he explained.Prior to swarming, the locusts undergo a series of physical changes - their body colour darkens and their muscles grow stronger. The 'Phase change' is at the heart of the locust pest problem, for locusts are one of the world's most destructive insect pests, affecting the livelihoods of 1 in 10 people on the planet. "To effectively control locust swarms, we must first understand exactly how it is that a single shy locust becomes a highly social animal that swarms," said University of Sydney Professor Steve Simpson who led the research for almost 20 years.The 'phase change' was caused by stimulation of sensory hairs on the hind leg of locusts. Professor Simpson's team began to investigate the neurological and neurochemical basis of this effect. Dr Michael L. Anstey, of the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Simpson, and Dr Stephen M. Rogers, part of Professor Malcolm Burrows' team at Cambridge, led the research investigating this novel field. "Here we have a solitary and lonely creature, the desert locust. But just give them a little serotonin, and they go and join a gang," said Malcolm Burrows.Of 13 neurochemicals in locusts that were gregarious (swarming form) and solitarious (non-swarming), the only neurochemical that showed a relationship with social behaviour was serotonin. "It was clear that as locusts switched from solitarious to gregarious, the amount of serotonin in their central nervous systems also increased," explained Professor Simpson. "The next step was to determine if this relationship actually meant that serotonin was the cause of gregarious, and thus swarming, behaviour in locusts," he added.To do this, the researchers either added serotonin or prevented the production of serotonin in locusts. The results show unequivocally that serotonin is responsible for the behavioural transformation of locusts from solitarious to gregarious. Serotonin was also found to be involved in social behaviour of species across the animal kingdom, including crustaceans, rats, and humans. The team has found that swarm-mode locusts had approximately three times more serotonin in their thoracic ganglia, part of the central nervous system, than their calm, solitary peers. "The question of how locusts transform their behaviour in this way has puzzled scientists for almost 90 years," said co-author Dr Michael L. Anstey, from Oxford University. "We knew the [physical] stimuli that cause locusts' amazing Jekyll and Hyde-style transformation. But nobody had been able to identify the changes in the nervous system that turn antisocial locusts into monstrous swarms. Now we finally have the evidence to provide an answer," he added. "The fact that serotonin causes the transition from a shy, antisocial animal into a party animal means that pharmacologically, gregarious locusts are on Ecstasy or Prozac," said Professor Simpson, who also explained that "(whilst a very good idea, in reality) it would be difficult to create a locust control agent that interferes with serotonin."Professor Simpson's team has significantly discovered that "locusts offer an exemplar of the how to span molecules to ecosystems - one of the greatest challenges in modern science." He also offered an explanation on the problem of using a locust control agent: "Because social behaviour in so many animals depends on serotonin, if we used unspecific serotonin antagonists in the environment, we run the risk of affecting other processes in locusts, as well as severely impacting animals other than locusts. We would need to be sure that locusts have a unique serotonin receptor that causes phase change, which we haven't identified yet. Any locust control agent would have to be specific for this serotonin receptor in locusts."This study, which was sponsored by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of England, England's Royal Society, the Australian Research Council Federation, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. The scientists that the conclusions of the study will provide a hint as to how to solve the problem of locust infestations, which affect China, Africa, and Australia. Dr. Rogers said the landmark discovery has opened a new area of study into ways of blocking specific serotonin receptors, “something that would allow us to break apart these swarms before they develop.”Charles Valentine Riley, Norman Criddle, and Sir Boris Petrovich Uvarov were also involved in the understanding and destructive control of the locust. Research at Oxford University has earlier identified that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change color, eat much more, and breed much more easily. Green locusts turn bright yellow and gain large muscles. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. It is estimated that the largest swarms have covered hundreds of square miles and consisted of many billions of locusts."Locust" is the swarming phase of short-horned grasshoppers of the family Acrididae. The origin and apparent extinction of certain species of locust—some of which reached 6 inches (15 cm) in length—are unclear. These are species that can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as nymphs and swarms as adults — both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly damaging crops. Though there are about 8,000 currently known species of grasshoppers, only 12 form locust swarms. In the history of the insect Desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is probably the most important because of its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) and its ability to migrate widely. Adult Desert Locusts grow to between 2-2.5 inches in length, can weigh 0.05-0.07 oz, and are excellent fliers. In religious mythology, the eighth Plague of Egypt in the Bible and Torah, a swarm of locusts ate all the crops of Egypt. "The gregarious phase is a strategy born of desperation and driven by hunger, and swarming is a response to find pastures new," Steve Rogers from Cambridge University emphasises.The extinction of the Rocky Mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus) in the late 19th century has been a source of puzzlement. Recent research suggests that the breeding grounds of this insect in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains came under sustained agricultural development during the large influx of gold miners, destroying the underground eggs of the locust. That species of locust had some of the largest recorded swarms.In the 1915 locust plague, which lasted from March to October 1915, locusts stripped areas in and around Palestine of almost all vegetation. This invasion of awesome proportions seriously compromised the already-depleted food supply of the region and sharpened the misery of all Jerusalemites. The plague resulted in several increases to the price of food. On April 25, 1915, the New York Times described the price increases: "Flour costs $15 a sack. Potatoes are six times the ordinary price. Sugar and petroleum are unprocurable and money has ceased to circulate."In the 2004 locust outbreak, the largest infestation of Desert Locust happened in Western and Northern Africa, affected a number of countries in the fertile northern regions of Africa. These infestations covered hundreds of square miles and involve billions of vegetation-munching insects, which repeatedly devastated agriculture, and cost huge amounts of money to control.In November, a locusts swarm 3.7 miles (6km) long devastated parts of Australia. Along the process of their active phases, these insects can eat their own bodyweight daily, and can fly swiftly, in swarms of billions covering 60 miles in five to eight hours in search of food. Researchers are now considering the development of sprays that convert swarming locusts back into solitary insects. “We hope that this greater understanding of the mechanisms causing such a big change in behaviour will help in the control of this pest, and more broadly help in understanding the widespread changes in behavioural traits of animals.” Malcolm Burrows said. However, according to Paul Anthony Stevenson of Germany's University of Leipzig, the discovery will not likely to a short-term pest control solution. "To be effective, antiserotonin-like chemicals would need to be applied when the animals are solitary locusts and scarce targets in vast expanses of desert -- about three locusts per 100 square meters (1,076 sq ft)," Stevenson explained. "Current serotonergic drugs are not designed for passing through the insect cuticle and sheath encasing the nervous system, nor are they insect-selective, hence their use is ecologically unjustifiable," he added.It has been revealed that the final report into a midair collision that killed 154 people in 2006 will blame a string of human error for the disaster. Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907, a Boeing 737, crashed into the ground after an Embraer Legacy 600 executive jet's wing clipped it. The Legacy, owned by ExcelAire, performed an emergency landing at a nearby airbase. The report says the Legacy's transponder was "inadvertently turned off by the hand of one of the pilots," and says this was the "central point in a chain of errors" leading to the collision. Crucially, the transponder failure - which the US pilots have denied causing - prevented the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) from functioning.The investigation, which was conducted by the Brazilian Air Force, criticised air traffic control (ATC) on a number of points; the Legacy was not properly advised on the altitude at which it should be cruising, when one controller changed shift there was a miscommunication between them about the Legacy's altitude and there was a failure of communication between the Legacy and ATC.The ExcelAire pilots, Joseph Lepore and Jan Paladino, were only allowed to return home after promising they would return to Brazil if summoned by the courts. The pair, along with four air traffic controllers, have been indicted over the crash and all six face up to three years in prison each.The purpose of this investigation, however, was not to acertain blame but to determine the root causes and suggest measures by which a reccurence can be avoided. Some moves have already been made in the aftermath; the accident was the deadliest in Brazil until TAM Airlines Flight 3054 crashed the following year and both were responsible for the 2006-2007 Brazilian aviation crisis. In response, a major overhaul of the nation's military ATC system is underway.ExcelAire's executive vice president David Rimmer was critical of the report. "The transponder issue is a distraction from the true cause of the accident, which is an air traffic control system that put two airplanes on a collision course for about an hour," he said. He complained that ATC did not "recognize the transponder failure and to provide increased separation between the two jets, as required by international aviation regulations."He was also concerned by the Air Force's methodology and the conclusions drawn from it. "We have no proof of how the transponder was turned off and no evidence to suggest it was inadvertently turned off by the pilots," he said. "[The Air Force] relied on theories rather than conducting in-depth testing of the equipment."The report's official release is next week, however it has already been seen by Brazilian newspapers, hence making its findings public today.Brazil has ceased searching for floating debris and bodies from Air France Flight 447. The Airbus A330 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean 26 days ago, on June 1.51 bodies from the 228 passengers and crew have been recovered, with most remaining unidentified. 600 pieces of wreckage have also been pulled from the sea. However, the Brazilian Air Force said that the chances of finding anything else was slim as it was nine days since the last corpse was found.French naval vessels, including a nuclear submarine, are continueing their search for the Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder. The recorders are due to continue to emit locator beacons until at least July 2.France's Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) is due to release a preliminary report on the same date. Speculation is blaming a failure of the pitot-static tubes, which serve as speed sensors, but the BEA is warning against early conclusions regarding the cause of the accident, the worst in the airline's history.A Brazilian passenger jet operated by budget airline Gol Transportes Aéreos that was reported missing whilst on route to Rio de Janeiro via Brasilia from Manaus has been located by the Brazilian Air Force. The wreckage of the Boeing 737, Flight 1907, which was carrying 149 passengers and 6 crew was spotted in the rural state of Mato Grosso in the Amazon rainforest. There are no survivors.At least 20 of the passengers of the flight were employees of Yamaha Corp.José Carlos Pereira, president of the Brazilian airport authority (Infraero) told journalists, "It would be very difficult for anyone to survive such a crash. Our experience shows that when one cannot find the fuselage relatively intact and when the wreckage is concentrated in a relatively small area, the chances of finding any survivors are practically non-existent"Gol released a statement saying "The wreckage of the plane was found 30 kilometres north of the Peixoto Azevedo municipality" Troops are currently attempting to make their way through the dense jungle to the wreckage on foot.Many relatives and friends desperate for information gathered at airports in Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and Manaus during the night.Aviation officials now say that initial reports that the airliner collided with a smaller private plane cannot be confirmed.Gol, which was founded in 2001, say that the plane was new and had only come into service this month.A passenger list and further information can be found on the Gol website. Further information for family members can be found by calling 0800 2800749.World relief organizations are assisting the Republic of the Congo after last month's deadly explosions at the Brazzaville Arms Depot that claimed around 300 lives, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and left parts of the city looking like a war zone.One month after the March 4 explosions and the relief efforts continue.Bernard Metraux, who is in charge of the ICRC mission in Brazzaville, said 292 people have died and around 12 bodies were still unidentified as of Monday. On Saturday, Pierre Moussa, Minister of Defense for the Republic of Congo, released a slightly lower death toll of 282. There was no explanation for discrepancies between the government's and the relief organization's figures as the ICRC's previous statement was already higher than Moussa's figure. Moussa said the death count, however, is expected to rise higher as the relief operations continue.Metraux also reported 75 children were still missing. The international organization has had success reuniting 42 children with their families in the aftermath and locating 23 missing children since. Also, the World Health Organization has confirmed around 10 cases of cholera, which was supported by Alexis Elira Dokekias, the nation's director general of health.Already in the first month of the operation, the munitions clearing teams have disposed of 16 tons of ordinance.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies expects the relief operation to last three more months.At least five construction workers have died in a bridge collapse in Massana, Andorra.  A 20 meter section of the bridge which was under construction collapsed at around noon on Saturday. Three fatalities had been confirmed by the evening after the accident. Another body had been retrieved from the rubble. A worker pulled from the site died of his injuries in hospital the next day.Six others were injured in the incident. Most of the workers were Portuguese. Around 60 workers were on site at the time of the collapse. French President and Co-Prince of Andorra Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his condolences and stated "France's support and solidarity during this ordeal”. Head of Government for Andorra, Jaume Bartumeu is set to travel to the accident site and visit the injured workers in hospital.    The cause of the collapse is still unknown. A police investigation is underway.The main library in Bristol, United Kingdom has been closed until further notice as a result of a fire which struck the building yesterday morning.Bristol City Council has reported that it is possible the library will reopen on Tuesday, although it did say that it was likely the building would remain closed on that day. The head of Library services at Bristol City Council commented on the incident. She said "we [the Library service] apologise to our customers for this inconvenience but it is not possible to open the library as there remains problem's with power to parts of the building and there is a need to give contractors clear access to clean smoke damage in some public areas. We will review the situation again on Monday morning and issue further updates when further information is available."The main library in Bristol, United Kingdom may be partially reopened on Monday after being closed for over a week due to a fire.Most of the ground floor of the library will reopen, although the first floor will remain closed. Bristol City Council reported last week that it was possible the library would reopen on Tuesday, although after the inspection on that day, it was decided it would remain closed.The head of Library services at Bristol City Council commented on the fire last week. She said "we [the Library service] apologise to our customers for this inconvenience but it is not possible to open the library as there remains problem's with power to parts of the building and there is a need to give contractors clear access to clean smoke damage in some public areas. We will review the situation again on Monday morning and issue further updates when further information is available."British actress Natasha Richardson has died, according to a statement released by a spokesperson. Richardson died after suffering a head injury from a fall, while she was receiving private skiing lessons at a Canadian resort in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec. She was 45 years old."Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time," said a spokesperson for Richardson in a statement to the press.It was reported Tuesday that Richardson was brain dead and had been transported by plane from Sacré-Cœur Hospital in Montreal, Canada to a care facility in New York City in the United States. Despite the fall, which happened on Monday, witnesses say she did not appear to have been seriously injured. Richardson was not wearing a helmet. An hour after the fall and after she returned to her hotel room, Richardson began to feel ill and was taken to a local hospital. She was later transported to Sacré-Coeur Hospital.Richardson made her movie debut in 1986 when she starred in the motion picture Gothic. In 1988 she was cast as the starring role in the film Patty Hearst. She also co-stared in the films Nell and the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. She also won a Tony Award in 1998 for her portrayal of Sally Bowles in the acclaimed revival of Cabaret.Richardson was also known for her cooking, having been a judge on the American television show Top Chef. She has hosted several upscale dinner parties in which she was the cook. Known names to have been part of her dinner parties are Meryl Streep and Laura Linney, among others.Richardson is survived by her husband, actor Liam Neeson, and her two sons, Daniel Jack age 12 and Micheal Richard Antonio age 13.All flights in and out of Birmingham Airport have been diverted or suspended until at least noon local time after a business jet carrying an organ for transplantation crashed on approach to the airport in Birmingham, England, during heavy fog. Two people were injured in the accident, one seriously. A spokesperson for the airport said: "We can confirm that an incident has occurred involving a private Cessna aircraft. The incident occurred on arrival into the airport and the emergency services are in attendance."West Midlands Police Chief Inspector Matt Markham confirmed that the aircraft was carrying an organ for transplantation, but said that it was undamaged in the accident and it had been taken from the aircraft. Later reports suggested that the liver had been transported to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where the operation was being carried out.Inspector Markham that the police were "alerted to what was described as a 'hard landing' at the airport" at approximately 3:35 pm local time, and pledged to carry out a "thorough investigation" into the cause of the accident. He said: "It would appear the aircraft came down on landing and soon after there was a small fire within the aircraft. There were two casualties on board the plane. One we believe is in  serious condition and has been airlifted to hospital; and the second one has been taken to hospital but with less significant injuries."Investigators examining the wreck of British Airways Flight 38, a Boeing 777 that crash landed short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport in the first hull loss of a 777, are examining the aircraft's fuel system as a possible factor in the crash. No-one was killed as the scheduled flight from Beijing, China lost power during final approach on January 17.136 passengers and 16 crew were on board when power was lost to the two Rolls-Royce engines about two miles from the runway, at a height of 600 feet. Autopilot and autothrottle were engaged at the time, the latter having just commanded an increase of thrust to the engines when power was lost. Co-pilot John Coward, in control at the time, was subsequently praised for being able to glide the disabled plane to within 1,000 feet of the runway, clearing a number of houses along the way.Subsequent investigation has revealed that not only did the engines not fail simultaneously, but neither failed completely, contradicting initial belief. A preliminary report by the United Kingdom's Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) stated that after the autothrottle commanded more thrust "The engines both initially responded but after about 3 seconds the thrust of the right engine reduced. Some eight seconds later the thrust reduced on the left engine to a similar level... Both engines continued to produce thrust at an engine speed above flight idle, but less than the commanded thrust." This situation prevailed until impact.On Wednesday the AAIB stated that they were examining "All possible scenarios that could explain the thrust reduction and continued lack of response of the engines." However, it also went on to specifically mention attention to the jet's fuel system, saying "This work includes a detailed analysis and examination of the complete fuel-flow path from the aircraft tanks to the engine-fuel nozzles." The AAIB also ruled out the plane having completely run out of fuel, stating that there was "adequate fuel" in the tanks when the plane crashed. In addition to the fuel required to get to the target destination or emergency alternative airport - whichever is further - aircraft typically carry between thirty and forty-five minutes worth of extra fuel as a safety margin.Possible scenarios being examined include fuel contamination, coming either from fuel taken on at Beijing or leakage from an unknown source. In particular, a heavy contaminant at the bottom of the tanks would explain a lack of earlier problems on the flight, as the fuel levels would only have become low in the final stages of the trip. Another possibility is that a central part of the fuel system developed a leak, reducing the amount of fuel available to the engines.It is known that, according to the AAIB, "the autothrottle and engine-control commands were performing as expected prior to, and after, the reduction in thrust," suggesting that all software in the aircraft was functioning correctly and rendering a software failure unlikely, although this possibility also remains under investigation.The investigation into the crash of a British Airways Boeing 777 (B777) written off on January 17 after landing short of the runway at London's Heathrow International Airport has been updated. The crash of Flight 38 injured one passenger seriously and 12 others on board, including four crew members, as well as being the first hull loss of a B777.The latest word from the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is that both engines had low fuel pressure in their high pressure (HP) fuel inlets, leading to the failure of both engines. Having departed from Beijing, China the aircraft was on final approach for landing at Heathrow when the thrust on the engines first reduced and became unresponsive, then ceased completely. The copilot, who was flying the aircraft at the time, received significant media praise for gliding the aircraft past housing and airport barriers to crash land the airliner onto the grass at the runway threshold, likely saving the 136 passengers and 16 crew from death or further injury as well as preventing potential ground casualties. The landing gear collapsed and the airframe, wings and engines were significantly damaged.Each HP inlet also exhibited "unusual and fresh cavitation damage to the outlet ports consistent with operation at low inlet pressure", according to the AAIB's latest report on investigatory progress, which also states engine failure was definitely caused by low pressure and that the autothrottle had opened up appropriate valves fully in an effort to increase fuel flow, but to no avail. The report indicates the investigation has also considered an area of unusually cold air over Russia which the B777 passed through at 40,000 feet on its journey. Between the Ural mountain range and East Scandinavia the air was found to have been as low as -76°C. The AAIB has ruled out fuel turning to ice as the fuel temperature never fell below -34°C. This is compared to an average freezing temperature of -47°C for jet fuel and test showing the fuel in the B777's tanks needed cooled to at least -57°C before it froze. Floating ice particles had previously been suggested as a possible causal factor.However, it has been suggested outside of the investigation that although the fuel did not freeze, it could have become unusually thickened, restricting its flow through the HP inlets, although the temperatures did remain within what are currently considered safe levels. Another possible explanation was that the fuel was contaminated or of inferior quality, but the AAIB has ruled this out. Also disproved are suggestions that the plane suffered a bird strike or that it was disrupted by electromagnetic interference from jamming devices set up to protect a motorcade carrying Prime Minister Gordon Brown.The report says that there was also no evidence to suggest any control systems failed, that the aircraft encountered a wake vortex or that there was core engine icing or other evidence that the engines suffered core lock. There was no damage to the fuel systems excluding that caused by the low pressure and no blockages, therefore it is suspected that fuel flow was restricted.The investigation has also begun analysing previous flights on comparable aircraft in a large sample of flights. Thus far, no parameters present on Flight 38 have been found that differ significantly from anything previously encountered. The purpose is primarily to identify potentially troublesome combinations of unusual operational parameters.The report concludes by stating that interested parties to the investigation, specifically the Federal Aviation Administration, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the Civil Aviation Authority and British Airways are being kept fully informed of the investigation's progress.Although this shows some progress, according to David Learmount, operations and safety editor at periodical industry magazine Flight International, “This report takes us absolutely nowhere, I think they still have no idea.”The B777 has never had any other hull losses or any fatal accidents and is considered to have one of the world's safest commercial airliners. According to one spokesman for British Airways “It has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft. At no stage since the accident has the AAIB, Boeing or Rolls Royce advised against the continued operation of the Boeing 777.”  The engines underwent analysis at manufacturer Rolls-Royce's facility in Derby, while airframer Boeing is studying the fuel systems in the United States. Rolls Royce's engine test bed was modified to replicate control inputs from aircraft control systems, and Boeing are working at replicating the cold conditions experienced over Eastern Europe. The investigation is ongoing.A British Airways flight from Beijing to London with 152 people on board has landed short of the runway at Heathow airport near London. One hundred and thirty six passengers and sixteen crew have been evacuated from the plane and thirteen people are reported to have sustained minor injuries.Reports suggest that the cause of the incident was a "total loss of power and avionics" in the plane, meaning that the pilot had to glide the plane towards the runway area.Flight BA038 from Beijing to Heathrow, a twin-engined Boeing 777-236ER, carried out an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport 12.42 p.m. local time, according to a Heathrow airport statement. The incident has delayed the flight carrying UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is flying to Beijing today on a visit to China and India.   Witnesses said the plane flew low on its approach, touched down on grass short of the runway and came to a halt on its belly at the edge of the runway. Passengers were quickly evacuated by emergency chutes as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The plane's undercarriage broke off during the landing and both wings as well as the starboard engine are badly damaged.In a press statement, BA said it is "very proud" of the way its staff - three flight crew and thirteen cabin crew - safely evacuated passengers with only six minor injuries resulting. The southern runway has been closed for operations and has resulted in all European short haul flights from Terminals 1, 2 and 3 being cancelled. Passengers travelling by Heathrow have been advised to check their flight status before arriving at the airport.A British Airways (BA) flight from London to Denver made an emergency landing at an airport in Iceland today after smoke was seen emerging from an oven in the aircraft's rear kitchen. A BA spokesman said that the Boeing 777 landed safely at Keflavik Airport. He added that the plane’s 268 passengers left the craft unharmed. A spokeswoman from the Iceland Civil Aviation Administration ruled out any terrorist involvement. She added: "They were 50 miles from Keflavik when it was thought there was a fire. But it turned out to be only smoke."The flight should complete its journey to the US tomorrow. Passengers are spending the night in a hotel.The three members of the flight crew and thirteen members of British Airways Flight 38 have been awarded with the BA Safety Medal. The airline considers the award to be its highest accolade and has only awarded it three times before.On January 17 the Boeing 777 airliner was on final approach to Heathrow Airport with 136 passengers on board when it suffered a loss of engine power. The plane crash landed immediately beyond the perimeter fence, just before the start of the runway.British Airways say that due to the crew's professionalism only minor injuries were sustained. The medals have been awarded for their handling of the accident.Captain Peter Burkill, who was on board, said "It is a great privilege for us to receive the BA Safety Medal. We are extremely honoured to be added to the list of the very few people who have received this award. The training we undergo at British Airways is second to none. During the events of the 17 January these skills kicked in, as we did everything we could to ensure the safety of our passengers."A BA CityFlyer Avro 146-RJ100 passenger jet with 71 people onboard made a crash-landing at London City Airport on Friday evening, after part of its gear failed upon landing. One passenger was hospitalised after the incident.According to witnesses, the aeroplane's front landing gear collapsed into the runway after the aircraft made a rough landing. The plane stopped on the runway, after which the 67 passengers and four crew members were evacuated by the use of emergency chutes.Following the incident, the airport's only runway was shut down and incoming flights diverted to other airports in the vicinity."Unfortunately, one passenger sustained a minor injury and is currently on the way to hospital. There was one other minor injury," British Airways said in a statement. "We don't know the nature of the injury or how it was caused yet. Our priority at the moment is to ensure all the passengers involved in the incident are well cared for by our ground staff."Justin Fletcher, a passenger onboard the aeroplane, described what happened in an interview with the BBC: "There was obviously quite a loud bang as the plane scratched in, the stewards and stewardesses were quick to evacuate everyone off, there was a few scrapes and cuts due to hitting the asphalt, all in all everyone seems to be doing quite well now." London City Airport is located in the eastern part of London, and is mainly used for domestic and European flights. It handles 80 000 flights and three million passengers a year.Government officials have confirmed that a six-year-old boy from the Claudy area of Londonderry Northern Ireland has drowned while on vacation with his family in Algarve, Portugal. The confirmation came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in London, England which stated that the boy drowned on Thursday July 24.The boy, identified by the FCO as Nathan Sharkey, had been on holiday with his family since earlier this week. Authorities have not released anymore information about the incident because the boy is a minor."Because the national in question is a minor we can release no further details," stated the FCO.The family is currently receiving assistance from the British Consul and the FCO. Nathan is survived by his parents and two brothers, one being his twin.Today the RCMP announced the identity of a snowmobiler killed in an avalanche on Sunday, bringing British Columbia's (BC's) avalanche death toll for the past three weeks up to 13. The victim, identified as Harold Keith Waldner, 45, of Rycroft, Alberta, had been part of a group of 14 snowmobilers exploring a remote area near Chetwynd in northern BC.Waldner and his party were about 25km (16mi) from their parked vehicles when the avalanche hit, burying five people in snow that was as much as three metres (9.8ft) deep. While all five were dug out by those who had not been buried, Waldner had already succumbed to the conditions, and his body was left by the group, fearing further slides; the body was recovered late Monday by search and rescue crews. The recovery effort had been hindered by the area still being at high risk for another avalanche.BC has seen an inordinate number of casualties due to avalanches this winter. Waldner was one of two deaths last weekend, the other occurring near Enderby. Though 30 snowmobilers quickly responded to a call to assist in digging out 24-year-old Matt Simmons, the man was not wearing a beacon and was not recovered quickly enough to save him.On December 28, eight snowmobilers died in slides near Fernie in BC's southeast.The RCMP are asking the public to take every precaution when in the backcountry. "Please do not operate snowmobiles in areas where avalanches are likely or may possibly occur," a news release urged.RCMP spokesman Constable Craig Douglass was critical of those not taking the necessary safety measures. "I don't know what goes through their minds, but I guess the fun outweighs the risks and they're making the choice to go in these areas." He noted that people can still enjoy the outdoors safely, as long as they find "places they can operate snowmobiles that are going to be safe, that are not in avalanche areas or zones."In the 2002-2003 winter season, BC saw 29 people killed in avalanches.The Geological Survey of Canada is reporting that there is a higher probability that a major earthquake could strike the south coast of British Columbia within the next week. The alert comes after seismologists began monitoring a grouping of small tremors moving north along the cascadia subduction zone from nearby Washington State. The phenomenon is called Epesodic Tremor and Slip (ETS), and it occurs on average every 14 months. ETS is causing the fault to begin moving in the opposite direction, in this case, Vancouver Island is actually shifting to the west, instead of to the east. This causes an added pressure on the strained fault line, and leads to the higher probability that a major earthquake could occur.The Cascadia subduction zone, running from Vancouver Island to northern California is one of the most volatile geologic fault lines in the world. Unlike the well known San Andreas fault, which has the potential of generating earthquakes in the 7–8 range, the Cascadia fault line has the potential of releasing mega quakes in the magnitude 9 range - the size of the Sumatra quake that killed over 250,000 people, mostly from the tsunamis it triggered. A quake of that magnitude could devastate a wide area, including Vancouver, British Columbia, Victoria, British Columbia, and Seattle, Washington, a denselypopulated area with close to 6 million residents.The Canadian geological survey points out, however, that this is only a higher probability, and the chances of a cataclysmic earthquake in the next week is still relatively low.Vancouverites often are unaware of the potential risk right below their feet. "Living in Los Angeles, we always got those little reminders every time the ground rumbled. We are indeed living in Earthquake Country. Up here, though, we don't get them as often, so I think people really forget that we live in an earthquake zone. And because we don't get those little shocks from time to time, that stress is just building and building, and who knows, these little tremors we're getting now, might be the straw that breaks the camel's back."A helicopter crash Tuesday in Cranbrook, British Columbia left a pedestrian and the aircraft's three occupants dead. Authorities such as Canada's Transportation Safety Board continue to investigate, and have not yet identified a reason for the crash. Canadian Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon issued a statement of condolences regarding those involved in the disaster, while confirming the federal government's involvement in the investigation."On behalf of the Government of Canada, I would like to convey my condolences to the families of those killed in this tragic accident," said Cannon.He continued, "We will cooperate fully with the Transportation Safety Board as they investigate this accident. Transport Canada has appointed a Minister's Observer, who will keep me informed of the investigation's progress."He also stated that "in addition, the department will verify that the company continues to comply with all aspects of Canadian Aviation Regulations and the conditions of its air operator certificate."Robert Anker, a British dancer and member of troupe Diversity when they won the 2009 season of Britain's Got Talent, died in a car accident in Canada on Thursday. Anker died after a collision between his Chevrolet Cobalt and a Ford pick-up truck. The accident occurred in Vaughan, Ontario at around 6:00 AM Thursday morning, local time. Anker, who moved to Canada last year, was 27 years old.York Regional Police confirmed the accident had occurred and the driver of the pick-up truck was not injured. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said "We are aware of the death of a British man in Canada. We are providing assistance to his family at this sad time".Anker's cousin Rochelle Hanson set up a JustGiving page, by yesterday already past its target of £5,000, to raise funds for his family to travel to the funeral in Canada. Hanson said "The family are devastated. He was an amazing and talented dancer. We would love to ensure that his family don’t worry or stress about money at this time."Diversity, Anker's former dance crew, tweeted "A former member of our group has tragically passed away. He inspired so many with his talent and was taken far too soon. R.I.P Rob." The Twitter account for Britain's Got Talent said "We are so sorry to hear of the loss of Robert Anker, our thoughts and condolences go out to his friends, family and the whole of Diversity."Dean Lee, a choreographer on talent show The X Factor, tweeted, "Rob Anker. I have no words to speak after hearing of your passing. This is truly heart breaking. Thanks for the memories. Shine bright."After winning the 2009 series of Britain's Got Talent, Anker performed in music videos of singers Jessie J and Paloma Faith, and in the production of Thriller Live in the West End. Anker and his girlfriend Cyndi married in September.A spokesperson for the Royal London Hospital has confirmed that British racing driver Henry Surtees has died following an accident at the Brands Hatch circuit earlier today. He was eighteen.Surtees was competing in the Formula Two championship when Jack Clarke's car spun off the track and into barriers ahead of him. A wheel and tyre detatched from Clarke's car and bounced across the track, striking Surtees on the head. Surtees was apparently knocked unconscious as the car continued straight on at the next corner and struck the barriers at speed with no attempt to brake. After the car came to a standstill one of the rear wheels continued to spin as the car remained accelerating; there was no further movement due to massive damage from the barrier impact.Surtees had only recently joined F2 at the start of the current season, having previously driven in the Formula Renault competition. Yesterday at Brands Hatch he celebrated his first podium in the series, earning third place.Son of John Surtees, a race driver who has held the 1964 Formula One championship and won the motorcycle world championships several times, Henry started off racing go carts and moved on to cars in 2006, competing in a junior championship.He went on to compete in the 2007 Formula BMW UK season, where he placed seventh overall. In that year he also contested in a limited number of Formula Renault races. In 2008 he was 12th in the Formula Renault championship but had better success in the Formula Renault Winter Series, where he had three podium finishes including one victory from four races. That year he also raced in the last races of the Formula Three season, where he earned another race win.Both his father John and mother Jane were watching the race in which their son was killed.A British pilot has died in a plane crash in the Caribbean Sea but managed to help save the lives of the nine passengers on the plane. Robert Mansell, aged 32, was a pilot who lived in the village of Knowle in the West Midlands of England. He had previously worked with Windward Islands Airways but was flying planes for Divi Divi Air at the time of his death.At 0930 local time, Mansell was flying with his nine passengers between the Caribbean islands of Curaçao and Bonaire when the right engine of his Britten-Norman Islander light aircraft failed. At this time the height above sea level was roughly 3,500 feet. The pilot made a mayday call. It has emerged that the last words that he said on the transmission were: "I’ve lost control of one of my engines…so long." The aircraft then crashed into the Caribbean Sea. The passengers — seven of them local, two of them tourists from the Netherlands — managed to escape from the plane and were rescued by services in the area.  The impact of the crash caused the pilot and several passengers to lose consciousness, however the passengers managed to recover and escape, suffering only minor head injuries.Two passengers tried to rescue the pilot as the plane was beginning to sink and Robert was still unconscious. However, the crash had damaged the safety harness attached to the pilot, and the passengers were unable to free him. They were left with no choice but to escape through the plane door when they noticed that it was beginning to sink. The body of Mansell has yet to be found but the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has now confirmed that he died on Wednesday, with a spokesperson for them saying: "We are aware of the death of a British national in a plane crash near Curaçao.""He's a hero," said Simon Janzen from Divi Divi Air. "All the passengers survived and he is the only one missing. If he wasn't a good pilot, he couldn't have ditched it so everyone could be saved. Other pilots wouldn't have known what to do but he landed the aircraft so that everyone could get out safely."Robert Mansell's father Roger expressed his disapproval. "I am furious," commented Roger. "If you have nine people on board and a plane is overloaded and a problem develops, it becomes much harder to fix." Roger said that Robert had repeatedly explained to him problems about overloading, as the weight of the luggage and the passengers was not checked properly. Roger continued: "He was a wonderful son and a hero. Quite how he managed to bring the plane down in the water like that without it breaking apart is beyond me. It is a miracle that the passengers survived."In response to the allegations made, Germaine Richie who is the owner of Divi Divi Air, made a comment saying: "We reject any allegations that we are overloading planes and putting safety at risk."A British plane caught on fire in Afghanistan. It was a four-engine propeller aircraft that got into trouble while landing. One of the aircraft's tyres exploded.Ambassador Stephen Evans escaped injury after the military transport plane, in which he was travelling, caught fire at an airstrip in southern Afghanistan. None were seriously hurt. All 27 people on board were safe.The driver of a taxicab was charged on Saturday by Wiltshire Police with the murder of Sian O'Callaghan, a 22-year-old woman. 47-year-old male Christopher Halliwell was arrested on Thursday. Personal assistant Sian O'Callaghan disappeared after departing from a nightclub, called Suju, in Swindon, England on March 19, 2011. She was never seen publicly again. The remains of her body were discovered during examinations taking place near Uffington, Oxfordshire on Thursday; the discovery was announced on Saturday.Christopher Halliwell is expected to appear in court in Swindon on Monday. Simon Brenchley, the District Crown Prosecutor, has stated: "I have been working closely with Wiltshire Police and now have authorised them to charge Christopher Halliwell with Sian O'Callaghan's murder. Having reviewed the evidence, I am satisfied that there is sufficient to charge him, and that it is in the public interest to do so. I will keep liaising closely with the police as their investigation continues."Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher is currently searching for individuals who may have been "lamping" (poaching) in the region of Ramsbury in Wiltshire or its surrounding area at approximately 0300 BST (0200 UTC) on March 19, 2011. He indicated that the police had no interest in prosecuting any poachers who came forward.Various tributes have been paid to Sian O'Callaghan since her death. At an event held on Saturday night, hundreds of balloons and Chinese lanterns were released. Thousands of people held a two minute silence at the Polo Ground in Swindon. Bowling group members had a period of silence at the club where O'Callaghan used to play. Individuals also left messages of condolence on a sign at the ground.On social networking website Facebook, a recent message from an event page entitled 'Lighting up the sky, for Sian' says: "In light of the recent tragic news of the discovery of a body police believe to be Sian's, we see it fit to change the purpose of this gathering. We are, sadly, no longer lighting Sian's way home, we are lighting the sky to show that a life has been taken, but will not be forgotten."Meanwhile, during ongoing searches in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, the remains of a second woman were unearthed. The woman is aged 23–30 years old, according to police. Referring to the as of yet formally unidentified individual, investigation leader Fulcher noted: "It has been indicated to me that this young woman was taken from the Swindon area between 2003 and 2005. The remains will now be subject of further forensic laboratory tests and a post-mortem examination. The police search at the site is expected to continue for the time being."A political candidate for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) has been injured in a plane crash. Nigel Farage, the former leader of the party, was in a two-seater plane when it crashed at an airfield in Northamptonshire.  The plane crashed just one hour after voting had opened on polling day.Farage, 46, was taken to a Banbury hospital with non-life threatening injuries.  The pilot of the plane is believed to have suffered more severe injuries and was transferred to a different hospital. The plane had landed at the airfield in Hinton-in-the-Hedges and was beginning to take off again when the accident happened. The plane was being flown with a UKIP banner and was due to fly over Buckinghamshire, the constituency where Farage is standing. A UKIP spokesman said about that incident that "We've had unconfirmed reports that either the banner got snagged up, or there were cross-winds and it was unfamiliar airfield to the pilot."  He added that after a discussion with an aviation expert that the banner could not be a factor in the accident.Chris Adams, a fellow UKIP candidate for the constituency of Aylesbury, released a statement on the condition of Farage.  He said "Nigel was unconscious but he can talk.  He's been coming in and out of consciousness and is now being X-rayed." The fire and ambulance services have remained at the scene of the crash and an investigation has been opened.Prime Minister Tony Blair, in a short statement at midday BST from Gleneagles, Scotland, said that it was his intention to travel to London within a few hours to get a clearer picture of the events, before returning to the G8 summit this evening.  Looking visibly shocked, he said that he believed it was "reasonably clear" that it was an act of terror, and that he hoped that the people of Britain could demonstrate that their will to overcome the events is greater than the terrorists' wish to cause destruction. He also said that his determination to "defend" the British way of life outweighed "extremist determination" to destroy it.He also made it clear that all members of the G8 council wish to continue talks in his absence, he is currently on his way back to London to talk directly to police chiefs and ministers.Five British sailors traveling in a yacht in the Persian Gulf were detained and released by Iranian authorities after they accidentally crossed into Iranian waters. The sailors were on their way to a race then they suffered propeller problems and drifted into Iranian waters.Iranian authorities interrogated the sailors and released them after they found no evidence of "bad intentions." They earlier warned that the sailors would face prosecution if they suspected any wrong doing."[There was] certainly no question of any malicious intent on the part of these five young people," stated the Iranian Foreign Ministry to the IRNA. The Revolutionary Guard stated, "after carrying out an investigation and interrogation of the five British sailors, it became clear that their illegal entry was a mistake."Team Pindar composed of David Bloomer, Luke Porter, Oliver Smith, Oliver Young and Sam Usher, were travelling to the Dubai-Muscat Offshore Sailing Race, a 360-mile (580-kilometer) race when they were arrested on November 25. The race took place on November 26. The sailors were met by team representatives and are being escorted in their yacht out of Iranian waters. David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary for the UK denies that the unconditional release was not a political move calling it a "human story" and that it had "nothing to do with politics. It's got nothing to do with the nuclear enrichment program."A similar incident took place in July, but on land. Three American hikers, identified as Shaun Gabriel Maxwell, Shane Bower and Sara Short, were arrested on July 31 in the country after they crossed into Iranian territory. Reports say the hikers accidentally crossed into Iran while hiking between Halabja and Ahmad Awa in the Kurdish Region of Iraq.A British soldier has been killed near the town of Sangin, in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan after a bomb explosion struck on Saturday afternoon. The death brings the current total of UK military personnel killed in Afghanistan up to 224 since 2001.The soldier, who has not yet been named, was from the Royal Logistic Corps. His family has now been told of what has happened and they now ask for a 24-hour time grace period before releasing any more information. A statement released from the Ministry of Defence read: "it is with great sadness that the Ministry of Defence must confirm the death of a soldier from the Royal Logistic Corps."Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield OBE, a spokesperson for Task Force Helmand, also made a statement. "It is with great sadness I confirm that a soldier from the Royal Logistic Corps died earlier today in an explosion in Helmand Province," he said. "He will be missed by us, his comrades, but he will not be forgotten."Yesterday the Surfer's Cottage, in Pichilemu, Chile, published a list on its website of people missing in the area, including several British tourists. Some of the named include Kirsty Duff, from Aberdeenshire, Dave Sandercock, from Edinburgh, both 25, Andre Lanyon, from Guernsey, and Laura Hapgood, both 29. Tina Cadwallader Lopes, her husband from Portugal, and their two children are also missing.Google's Person Finder was created after the Haiti earthquake to help people find family or friends in Chile. Initially reported deceased through this service, Kirsty Duff and Dave Sandercock were later reported alive and safe in Santiago.The Guardian reports that at least two couples from the UK were staying in the resort of Pichilemu, and are among those who are yet to contact their families.The couple was reported alive by Ellie Sandercock, who also said they were in Santiago, as of 9 PM GMT in March 1, 2010.According to radio communications by the Buffalo, New York Fire Department, at approximately 10:15 p.m. EST two water pipes inside the Darwin D. Martin House, a National Historical Landmark, broke causing several rooms to flood.The breaks were discovered in the gift shop area of the house but quickly began to flood other areas near the shop as firefighters had a difficult time locating the main shut off valves.At 10:50 p.m., firefighters reported to have shut off "several main valves" stopping the flow of water. The cost of the water damage is not known, but covered several rooms. Recent sub-zero temperatures in the city is said to be the cause of the break. At the time of the call, the temperature was only 10°F with a wind chill of 4°F above zero. On Sunday the temperature was only 3°F with a wind chill of -23°F.The house, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, has seen rough times over the years, experiencing problems such as vandalism. The first half of the complex was built in 1903 and finished in 1905. After the pergola, conservatory, and carriage were demolished, restoration and rebuild began in 1992 and is scheduled for completion in 2008 or 2009.A rupture in the underground stormwater drain system opened a huge sinkhole on February 23, killing three people and bringing down twelve houses in Guatemala City.Teenagers Irma and David Soyos and their father, 53-year old Domingo Soyos were killed when their house collapsed into the sinkhole. Nearly a thousand people were evacuated from the San Antonio neighborhood after the collapse. Wikinews interviewed Eric Haddox, a civil engineer who has visited the site of the sinkhole and spoken to the engineers working on fixing the drain. Mr. Haddox, who specialises in the building of earthworks, roads, water supply and sewage systems, and is working as a missionary in Guatemala, visited the site following the collapse to help in the recovery effort.Mr. Haddox told us that the size of the hole is much smaller than the 330 feet depth originally reported and that the erosion causing the collapse is believed to have happened over a long time, and not just during the recent rains as initially suspected. There are also concerns that a four-story building less than a metre from the edge of the hole may collapse as the earth under the building continues to be eroded.Just before 5 a.m. on October 31, 2007, a water main broke underground in the middle of downtown London, Ontario at the intersection of Wellington and Dundas. As water gushed 5 metres up into the air the pavement slowly eroded over several hours eventually causing a giant sinkhole 9 m wide and 4 m deep; large enough for a city bus to hide in. The quickly escaping water eventually flooded the entire basement of the  Galleria Mall including the underground parking. The flooding affected several major electrical systems and left several downtown businesses over several blocks without power including City Hall, the  Galleria Mall, both  TD Bank Buildings and CIBC until 9 p.m. that night.Steven Lacey, 56, from Brooten, Minnesota, was killed in a one-vehicle rollover late Sunday night, July 16, 2006.The Pope County Sheriff’s Office said that at approximately 11 p.m. his vehicle went off the road and rolled over on 110th Avenue, near Brooten, Minnesota, in Pope County, Minnesota's Bangor Township, about 15 miles SE from Glenwood, MN, about 55 miles WNW from St. Cloud, MN, or about 100 miles NW from the Twin Cities.The victim was reportedly killed on impact when his 1995 Chevy pickup rolled over after leaving the road.The Pope County Sheriff's department reports that Lacey was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident.UK Chancellor Gordon Brown promises that UK will lead the world in the fight against global warming.The Stern Review, the first about the economic effects of climate change, is published today. Commissioned by the British Government and prepared by Sir Nicholas Stern, former top economist at the World Bank, it forecasts that, if action is not taken now, the world will suffer an economic disaster on an unprecedented scale. 100 million people will be refugees from floods caused by rising water levels, drought caused by the melting of glaciers will affect 1 in 6 of the world's population, up to 40% of present wildlife species will become extinct and the world economy will shrink by 20%.Sir Nicholas claims that these forecasts are based on the best available scientific evidence about the extent and effects of climate change. He does not claim absolute certainty, only a high degree of probability that the world is facing economic catastrophe if action is not taken immediately. An expenditure of just 1% of the world's wealth now could avert it. Spending £1 now could save £5, or even more, in the future. The effects of global warming can be contained, says the Review, if about 1% of the world's GDP is invested in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. This investment must take place over the next 10 to 20 years otherwise the effects of climate change could be disastrous on a scale comparable to the great wars and the slump of the first half of the last century. There has to be action at national, regional and international levels. The Review concludes that the actions to be taken include emissions trading, doubling investment in research and development of low carbon energy sources, curbing deforestation and supporting adaptation in poorer countries by developing crops appropriate to the changed climatic conditions.The Stern Review shows that the scientific evidence for global warming is "overwhelming", said Prime Minister Blair. Chancellor Gordon Brown said that Britain will take the lead in persuading the world of the seriousness of the problem. All the major political parties in Britain have been discussing climate change.The Review is attracting a great deal of media attention. Salient among the views being reported are those of a number of experts including the following:Professor Bill Mcguire, Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre who says that Stern has greatly underestimated the effects of global warming. Martin Livermore, The Scientific Alliance asserts that "climate is not driven primarily by human use of fossil fuels" and that the money to be spent is unlikely to have much effect: it would be better spent on the world's poor. Pia Hansen, European Commission Spokeswoman says doing nothing is not an option, we must act now.Simon Retallack, UK Think Tank IPPR - this (Review) removes the last refuge of the "do-nothing" approach on climate change, particularly in the US.Tom Delay, The Carbon Trust - The Review offers a huge business opportunity.Richard Lambert,CBI Director Genera says that a global system of carbon trading is urgently needed.Charlie Kronick, Greenpeace - now the government must act and, among other things, invest in efficient decentralised power stations and tackle the growth of aviation.Concurrently with the publication of the Stern Review, the United Nations reports that emissions from the industrialsed world are still rising.  There has been a 2.4% increase in emissions across 41 industrialised countries in the first four years of this century. Britain, France and Germany are near to achieving their Kyoto Protocol targets, but the US is the biggest polluter and its emissions have been increasing.The Kyoto Protocol calls for a reduction of 5% of pollutants below 1990 levels. There has been a reduction of 3.3% since then but this has been the result of the collapse of industry in Eastern Europe which has counterbalanced the increases in the rich countries. The Stern Review suggests that the Kyoto targets are too modest.In San Pasqual a brush fire was dealt with as it burned four acres of wildlands. This may have been due to sparks from a vehicle accident. The blaze lasted from 3:30 to 4:30 PM until fire trucks and many other emergency vehicles helped stop the blaze.A wildfire rages along the mountainside of Makua Valley near Kaeana Point, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.  Honolulu firefighters were called in at 2 pm yesterday (local time).  A Wikinews contributor was on the scene with a camera.Local and federal firefighters responded to the fire with trucks and helicopters.  The website of a local TV news service reported this morning that 100 acres (40 hectares) had burned, but that no buildings were under threat.Wikinews does not know how the fire started.  The beach across the street is a popular camping area, so a campfire or cigarette may have set the mountainside ablaze. Makua Valley (21.531° N 158.225° W) is on the north western corner of Oahu, about 40 miles (65 km) by road from Honolulu, Hawaii's capital. The United States Army purchased three tracts of land for Howitzer emplacements in the 1920s, and has used Makua Valley as a live fire training range ever since (with some interruptions due to legal challenges.)Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters were called in on Wednesday, September 2nd, to help contain the wildfires on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai.Smaller helicopters that were fighting the fire since it started around noon on August 29th were redeployed as well. According to Gen Iinuma, Maui County Civil Defense administrator, the CH-47s carry 2000-gallon buckets of water, whereas the smaller helicopters only have 100-gallon buckets.  The Chinooks can dump more water in fewer trips than the smaller helicopters.  On the other hand, the tremendous downdraft from the bigger aircraft may make the fire worse."If they don't do it right, they'll fan the fire," Iinuma said.According to Iinuma, ground crews are continuing to maintain the fire's perimeter, which remained unchanged from Tuesday.  The helicopters are being used to fight the fires where ground crews can't reach, such as steep mountain passes and valleys.Iinuma also expressed concern about a red flag advisory the National Weather service put out for all leeward areas of the Hawaiian Islands, meaning conditions are ripe for fires.Lieutenant Governor James "Duke" Aiona, who took an aerial survey of Molokai's brush fire area, said it was "no immediate threat".  He also noted that the fire seemed to come right up to the perimeter of some properties, but almost always stopped there.Aiona's observations are mirrored by a local business owners' story.  The wildfires destroyed the beehives of Molokai Meli, a family-owned honey business in Kapaakea, but residents admit that the beehives were not their main concern. "We were just beating the edges with wet towels and sheets to try and keep it from getting to the houses that are just right over that ridge," said co-owner Brenda Kaneshiro.  Luckily, the property was spared, though the beehives weren't."All that metal right there, that's where they all were, there were 33 of them," said Elijah Kaneshiro, the owner's son.A brush fire erupted at 12:44 p.m. PDT Wednesday in the Westside neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California. Many structures, including the Getty Museum, are threatened. Visitors to the museum were seen to line up awaiting transport out of the area. Over 800 employees and an undetermined number of visitors were evacuated.  Mount St. Mary's College has also been evacuated. School is out for the summer months, but there were about 300 on campus. As of late afternoon, no homes were in harms way, but residents were encouraged to leave the area as a precautionary measure.Over 30 to 40 acres of brush land have been destroyed by late afternoon.Between 150 and 250 firefighters were on the scene assisted by three helicopters.  "We feel very confident we'll have this fire under control very shortly," said Fire Chief Douglas Barry.The investigation into Continental Connection Flight 3407, which crashed near Buffalo, New York last week, suggests that the pilot of the turboprop commuter airliner may have put the aircraft into its plunge.A source close to the investigation says that information from the flight data recorder on board the aeroplane indicated that the pilot's control column, the device which is used to steer the aircraft, was pulled upward abruptly, thereby causing the nose of the aeroplane to pitch up.The sudden pitch-up movement happened soon after the flight crew received a warning in the cockpit that the aircraft was about to stall. In aviation, a stall is when the air no longer flows over the wings of an aeroplane, and the aircraft can no longer keep the lift necessary to keep it airborne, causing it to fall. The normal manoeuvre to recover from a stall for wing icing is to apply full power to the engines and push the nose down. For a tail stall recovery, the opposite procedure is used: the nose should be pulled up and engine power reduced. In this instance, the pilot seems to have pulled the nose upward, but also increased the engine throttles to their full setting.After the aeroplane pulled up abruptly, it then pitched down at an angle of 31 degrees, rolling left and right, partially upside-down. This sort of stall is known as an aggravated stall, and it can be very difficult to return the aeroplane to normal flight from one. In this case, the pilot had less than two thousand feet to do so before the aircraft crashed into the ground.The pilot's training has now been put into question, and it was discovered that the captain, Marvin Renslow, aged 47, had logged only 110 hours in this particular aircraft, though he had thousands of hours in similar aircraft. Experts say his experience should have adequately prepared him.A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, Keith Holloway, said that it is currently too early to definitively say what caused the crash. "We have not concluded anything," he said.Continental Connection Flight 3407 crashed into a house in Clarence Center, a suburb of Buffalo on February 12 in icy weather, killing all 49 people on board the aeroplane and one person on the ground.12 firefighters in Buffalo, New York, United States have been taken to the hospital where they are being treated for smoke and chemical inhalation after a massive fire broke out at a warehouse on Buffalo's west side, early Monday morning. At least three fire companies started battling the blaze, which engulfed the entire warehouse, sending a plume of smoke into the air which could be seen for several miles, at one point darkening the sky. All 12 firefighters are being treated at Erie County Medical Center, but their conditions are not known. At least 80 firefighters were reported to be on scene along with a total of nine of the 19 fire companies in Buffalo. Firefighters were still on scene as of 9:15 a.m. EDT (UTC-4) today, nearly 24 hours after the fire started.The fire started at the Leisure Living Pool Supplies warehouse at 1130 Niagara street between West Ferry and Albany streets behind the Rich Products building at around 10:30 a.m. Monday and was not brought under control until 6:30 a.m. today. The warehouse is three floors tall. Firefighters had the fire under control just before 12:00 p.m. Monday, but wind off Lake Erie reignited the fire at around 3:00 p.m. At around 7:00 p.m., most of the blaze was under control, but smoke could still be seen coming from the building. All employees from both Rich's and the chemical company have been sent home for the day and made it out safely. The building is owned by PoolSupplies.com which is a division of Leisure Living, selling supplies, recreation and chemicals for swimming pools. Leisure Living is a company of Island Pools. At 9:00 p.m., firefighters reported that most of the fire was contained under the collapsed portions of the building, but around 10:00 p.m. firefighters reported that more thick black smoke started to rise from the building. Black smoke usually indicates burning, whereas white smoke often indicates water putting out a fire. Firefighters are using a helicopter, courtesy of the Erie County Sheriff's Department, that is equipped with infrared cameras in order to see the areas of the building which still contain a significant amount of heat or fire.After having fought the fire for over 24 hours, fire officials stated that the fire was mostly extinguished and ordered fire companies to start shutting down the hoses and pack up their equipment. Just before 1:00 p.m. the fire command post stated that fire investigators were on scene and that "they can call us (firefighters) back if they need anything."Officials have urged all residents near the blaze to stay indoors and to shut all windows and doors due to the smoke which has been blowing close to the ground. At least one civilian who was inside a park at the foot of Ferry was also taken to the hospital for smoke and chemical inhalation. Officials were able to evacuate the park and no other injuries were reported. At one point, the sun was blocked by the black smoke rising from the building."The fire reignited again sometime this afternoon. It appears it reignited due to the earlier collapse of the roof and the winds off the lake. Right now, one thing fire officials would like to get out and stress is anyone in and around the Niagara and Ferry area, if you could please go indoors, and shut your doors," stated Michael DeGeorge, a spokesman for the Buffalo Police Department, to reporters. DeGeorge also stated that no residents have been evacuated.The northbound lane of the I-190 expressway, which lies just to the west of the warehouse, was closed at the Porter Street exit at the Peace Bridge to the exit leading to the 198 expressway for several hours. At 11:15 p.m., firefighters stated they would begin to reopen the lane. Niagara street from Albany to West Ferry reopened to normal traffic in the late morning hours of Tuesday.Throughout Monday afternoon and early evening, employees of Marco's Restaurant on Niagara and Albany were providing ice and beverages to firefighters and police officers who were on scene. Temperatures were quite warm, in the upper 70's (F), with winds gusting to nearly 15-20 MPH, coming out of the southwest. Although the wind assisted in reigniting the fire, it also assisted firefighters by quickly clearing the area of smoke.The warehouse is a storage and distribution facility for pool chemicals, especially chlorine. Chemical drops could be felt flying through the air, which also had the smell of bleach. According to a source who spoke to Wikinews on condition of anonymity, the warehouse contained over US$8 million in supplies and chemicals.Earlier tests performed on the air by firefighters and Haz-mat officials had shown that the smoke and fumes rising from the fire are not dangerous or toxic. Further tests were performed, but those results are not yet known and officials don't believe there was any danger to the air. Officials will testing the water runoff from fire hoses to make sure that it is not contaminated as it is emptying into the Niagara River. The warehouse is located just down stream from a drinking water pumping station with several more scattered along the River from Buffalo to Niagara Falls.The cause of the fire is not known and is under investigation. Last year, on May 14, 2007, at least five buildings that were part of a warehouse complex about 1/3 of a mile from Leisure caught fire, and required nearly 130 firefighters to battle the blaze. Smoke from that fire was seen over 40 miles away.Miami Dade Fire Rescue, Urban Search and Rescue Florida Task Force 1 Members were on the scene since last night. Search dogs worked the scene all night.According to current reports, sometime early this morning, an apartment building in Brittons Hill, Barbados fell into a cave below.Five family members are known to be trapped in the collapse, although reports have not be made as to whether these are the only individuals involved. Rescue workers, as well as several prominent politicians are currently on the scene; two cranes have been deployed to remove debris. Evacuation has occurred, with an extension of this area being discussed.Miami Dade Police arrived on the scene late Sunday night and are now in a joint effort with the Barbados Defence Force, Barbados Fire Service and Royal Barbados Police Force to rescue possible survivors. Prime Minister Owen Arthur also stated that surveys are currently being conducted to determine the stability of the surrounding area, and only after these reports have been compiled will residents know whether they will be able to return to their homes. A cadaver dog was sent into the cavern and has identified two areas where there are possible dead bodies. Sadly it is no longer a rescue mission but recovery one.A four-story building on 62nd Street in Manhattan collapsed after an explosion Monday. Both the White House and New York Fire Department have said the explosion was not caused by a terrorist attack. The New York Fire Department said that the owner of the building, Dr. Nicholas Bartha, might have deliberately caused the explosion in a suicide attempt after a difficult divorce.  According to the latest reports, five people were injured by the blast, one of whom was hospitalised in critical condition.  An additional ten firefighters were injured in the following rescue operation. No deaths have been reported.Most sources give the cause as a natural gas leak that ignited; a ConEd spokesperson said that someone had reported a gas leak to them about one and a half hours before the explosion took place. The resulting fire, which began in the basement, burned strongly for some time, but was later brought under control by firefighters.Numerous people described the shockwave from the blast as being similar to an earthquake.A hostel collapsed in Mecca, the holy city of Islam at about 10 o'clock this morning local time.  The building housed a number of pilgrims who came to visit the holy city at the eve of hajj pilgrimage.  The hostel's guests were mostly citizens of the United Arab Emirates.  The death toll is at least 15, a figure which is expected to rise.  The building was situated very close to the holy mosque Masjid al Haram.A decades-old building collapsed along Ma Tau Wai Road in Hong Kong at about 1:30pm on Friday, local time. That building was located at 45J, Ma Tau Wai Road in Hung Hom. A shop on its ground floor was undergoing renovations when the building collapsed. The street was full of dust afterwards. Firefighters arrived at the scene to search survivors and they asked residents in the buildings nearby to evacuate the area. Those buildings included 45G and 45H.Chief Executive Donald Tsang called for an investigation into the cause of the building collapse. He aimed at preventing similar incidents. The government required all old buildings with similar structures to undergo inspection, according to Secretary for Development Carrie Lam. The government has confirmed that four people were dead in the incident. Rescue efforts ended on Saturday morning when the government confirmed that no one was missing. Lam visited the scene on Saturday afternoon and sought advice from the police and Buildings Department. The police has started its investigation into the incident. Secretary for Labour & Welfare Matthew Cheung said that the government would do its best to meet the victims' needs.The collapsed building was more than 50 years old. The government had inspected its five-storey structure before the incident and had ordered repairs. After the tragedy, the government announced that it would inspect buildings older than 50 years in one month. The government has restricted access to buildings at 45G and 45H as they were in danger.A building being prepared for demolition collapsed this morning in New York's Upper West Side around 9 a.m. EDT.  Five people are known to be injured from the accident, as well as one rescue worker who was injured in the aftermath. None of the injuries were life-threatening.The building was a supermarket, which was being taken down to make room for a high-rise building, something that residents took issue with. The roof, front wall, and scaffolding all fell to the ground, as stated by Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta.Soon after the incident at least 100 police and fire department personnel combed the wreckage for more victims, using search and rescue dogs to find people by scent. They quickly accounted for the twenty-five construction workers who were working on the supermarket. Most of the victims' injuries were broken bones, including one person who broke all four extremities.Subway lines 1, 2, and 3 have been closed or redirected in response, along with the M104 bus.Chinese troops today destroyed a variety of debris, including wooden houses, as part of an effort to slow the flooding of a lake. A lake had formed after the large earthquake that hit Jiangyou, and troops are now trying to subside the water flow to contain flooding. They are doing this with the intention of forming a spillway, which aims to divert the continuing flow of water from the heavily populated areas.The Tangjiashan Lake formed when a large earthquake hit China last month and it has continued to expand despite efforts to halt its growth. Police have remained on high alert since China was hit by the Sichuan earthquake, which has resulted in thousands of deaths.Peter William Raeburn Hunter, a 61-year-old stock agent from Hastings, New Zealand, died early yesterday morning from a rampaging friesian bull. The bull first flung recently married Hunter in the air and then gored him at Stortford Lodge saleyards in Hastings.Hunter had tried to escape into another yard but the bull rammed him against the yard rails. He then fell to the ground but the bull didn't stop attacking him until another agent came to his aid and hit the animal on the nose with a stick.Bruce Campbell, yards manager, said: "The agent was behind an alleyway gate which the bull lifted off its hinges. It was awful and has given us all a real shake-up."Hunter was then transported to Hawke's Bay hospital but died before he got to the hospital.The bull has now been shipped to Palmerston North on a truck to be slaughtered after the police declined the request to shoot the bull dead at the lodge. Acting Sergeant Andy Clinton said: "It calmed down and they had no problems loading it on the truck."It was the first death at the lodge in the 103 years that it has been operating.Friesian bulls are not normally dangerous. "Peter was very much a valued member of the local team," Elders Livestock, managing director, Stuart Chapman said. "It's a freak accident, an absolute tragedy."A report by the British Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the Buncefield oil depot fire of December 2005 has suggested that an oil tank at the site was overflowing for 40 minutes before the first explosion took place. A fire soon spread throughout the depot and some of the surrounding area, sending huge plumes of smoke into the air, and the fire took several days to be extinguished.The HSE report, the third progress report into the disaster, explains with 'reasonable confidence' that Tank 912 in bund A of the site started receiving unleaded motor fuel from 7 p.m. UTC on December 10, 2005. By 5:20 a.m. the next day, the tank had started to overflow, spilling through air vents at the top of the tank and down the outside. Vapour from the fuel started to form from 5:38 a.m., and by 5:46 a.m. was 2 metres deep, flowing in all directions. The first explosion took place at 6:01 a.m.Control systems measuring the levels within the tank should have prevented overspilling. A 'servo level gauge' should have sent data back to the control room, but this gave an unchanged reading from 3 a.m., despite the levels continuing to rise. Additionally, a second, float-based safety cut-out should have stopped the inward flow once the 'ultimate high level' was reached, but this too appears to have failed.It is not known for certain what caused the spark that led to the first explosion. Any evidence is likely to have been destroyed in the fire, and so the exact cause may never be known.The HSE report did not place any blame, for fear of jeapodising future court cases. Some, including MP for the Hemel Hempstead Mike Penning, have called for a full public inquiry. Many local residents were forced to leave their homes after suffering damage to their houses from the explosion.The explosion and fire, whilst being one of the biggest health and safety disasters in Britain, did not cause any deaths.On Tuesday, February 10, the American civilian communications satellite Iridium 33, launched in 1997, and the defunct Russian military communications satellite Kosmos-2251, launched in 1993, collided over Siberia. Five days after the collision, reports have surfaced that burning debris from the collision has been spotted over several U.S. cities from New Mexico to Kentucky.Calls to 9-1-1 began to come in to Williamson County, Texas sheriff's office around 12:30 p.m. (CT) that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of Austin, Houston, Waco and San Antonio. Residents reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions. After a search of several areas, the Williamson county sheriff's office reported that no debris or impact sites were found. Earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding. Steve Thornton, a resident in Austin told KEYE-TV that he "saw something burn up in the atmosphere going east to west at 40 degrees in the horizon looking north" which was "about the size of a half moon and as bright as a welders torch".  Other residents reported to KEYE-TV that they saw an "egg-shape with an orange center and bluish outer aura; a silvery-white tail."  Some report the incident lasting about 10 minutes.On February 13, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an alert following reports of "explosions and earthquakes" along with "flashes in the sky" in Jackson and Louisville, Kentucky. There were no injures and authorities could not locate any damage."The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris. These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in vibrations felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky," said the NOAA in a public information statement on February 13. The FAA also warns that the debris could cause damage to aircraft in areas reporting falling debris."Aircraft are advised that a potential hazard may occur due to reentry of satellite debris into the Earth's atmosphere. It is critical that all pilots/crew members report any observed falling space debris," said the FAA on February 13. Both the NOAA and FAA alerts are in place until further notice and cover an area from New Mexico to Kentucky.However, Dr. Marco Ciocca, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University told WKYT in Kentucky it would "be months" before any of the satellite wreckage enters the Earth's atmosphere. "The debris doesn't simply fall out of its orbit. It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into Earth's atmosphere." The satellites, both of which weighed in excess of 1,000 pounds, and traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour, collided 491 miles above the Earth. Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive. They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the Earth will be affected. The United States Strategic Command of the U.S. Department of Defense office is tracking the debris. The result of plotting analysis will be posted to a public website.Federal investigators with the Chemical Safety Board (CSB) of the United States have declared that a recent explosion that damaged homes alongside a Woods Cross, Utah refinery was triggered when a pipe burst. The revelation comes as locals begin questioning the decision to build houses near the facility.The explosion at the Silver Eagle refinery on Wednesday morning was the second next year, and blasted a fireball into the neighbourhood. Ten houses suffered damage including cracked foundations, roofs lifted off, doors and windows blown out and debris hurled into rooms. One resident, Linda Wood, has been told to leave her house, which lies condemned after it was knocked clear of its foundations and damaged structurally.Two local emergency dispatch centers were clogged up as calls came through to the 911 emergency number. Firefighters arrived quickly and tackled the resulting blaze at the refinery after establishing that there were no injuries. The 1950s refinery was not evacuated and is expected to continue operating despite the damage. It employs 80 people.Silver Eagle's own firefighting crews were already in control when they were joined by the emergency services, and together they put the flames out in around thirty minutes. Woods Cross mayor Kent Perry said that over the last six months there have been a lot of improvements in local firefighting and praised the reaction of emergency services. Later, 120 residents were visited by structural engineers to assess damage. There were also power outages in the area, with two other refineries amongst those affected.Silver Eagle had also sent employees on a firefighting course following another explosion in January. In that accident, a large cloud of flammable vapour developed over a tank of naptha before igniting, causing a flash fire that injured several employees. The firm has said they will pay for all the damages caused by the latest incident, and Perry advised affected people to keep track of expenses incurred.As well as the CSB, Utah's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Silver Eagle themselves are investigating the accident. The CSB released preliminary findings yesterday that indicated a burst pipe was to blame, although the reasons for its failure are unknown.A pipe ten inches in diameter burst along a horizontal section near a point where it changed direction from vertical. The pipe normally carried hydrogen and diesel and was linked to a reactor that took waxes out of diesel fuel, but due to maintenance by Silver Eagle the pipe was only transporting pressurised hydrogen. When it failed at 9:15 630 pounds of hydrogen spilled out and were ignited by a nearby furnace. The resulting 800 degrees Fahrenheit fireball leapt 100 feet into the air and sent a string of pressure waves to buffet the housing, as the pipe pointed east towards the homes.The CSB's Donald Holmstrom commented that "The unit was immediately engulfed in flames... We're extremely fortunate that no one got hurt. Five workers were in this process unit just a few minutes before." The revelations come as local residents expressed concern about the fact that houses were built so close to the refinery in the first place.It has been discovered that there were no houses near the refinery until six years ago, when an application was denied after an engineer commissioned by the council reported that the risks were too high. However, the developer convinced officials to change their minds with a report by a company he had hired himself. The CSB is due to look into these studies as well as one by the refinery. An opinion piece by the Salt Lake Tribune also criticised the company's safety record, with the refinery also experiencing explosions in 2005 and 2007. However, the refinery had recently passed a safety inspection when the accident occurred. The CSB will examine whether the refinery was properly inspecting the pipe.An accident involving a city bus and a car at Sycamore and Monroe streets in the city of Buffalo, New York, United States, has injured at least 10 people, some seriously. The accident happened around 4:00 p.m. (EDT).According to Buffalo Fire Department radio communications, at least two of the four people in the car will have to be removed by the 'jaws of life'. Their condition is considered serious. The condition of the other two passengers is not known. There are at least eight people on the bus. At about 4:15 p.m., a mobile triage was dispatched to the scene to determine how many of the passengers on the bus would need to be taken to local hospitals for treatment. At least six will be "packaged" and transported to Buffalo General Hospital.By, 4:20 p.m., at least one of the trapped passengers was removed from the car. By 4:30, the second passenger had been removed. Both will also be treated at Buffalo General Hospital.The bus is operated by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority. The cause of the accident is under investigation.State TV reports that a bus collided with a train in Cuba Saturday killing at least 28 people. Another 73 people were injured in the accident, including 15 in critical condition.A statement read on state television said the collision occurred in the province of Granma.Juventud Rebelde newspaper reports that the accident occurred at a railroad crossing in the very small town of Veguita in the Bayamo municipality.The train was traveling from Santiago to Manzanillo, when it collided with a bus that was traveling from Bayamo to Campechuela.The train hit the bus, dragged it across the tracks, and pushed it off a nearby bridge. The cause remains under investigation.Official reports say that Maoist rebels attacked a bus earlier today in central India, killing many people.The incident occurred in the Dantewada district of the Chhattisgarh state, when the fighters blew up a landmine underneath the bus. Al Jazeera and local television stations say up to fifty people may have died, although officials put the death toll at twenty in comments to the Agence France-Presse news service.An official said the vehicle, although intended as a regular transport bus, was occupied primarily with security forces.Violence in Chhattisgarh has increased recently, blamed on an Indian Maoist movement. Rebels killed 75 security personnel in the province last month. The Indian government initiated a "massive anti-Maoist offensive" in October 2009, deploying 50,000 troops to several states, among them Chhattisgarh.A bus carrying children from Smolensk to Kaluga on Sunday overturned in Babyninsky, Russia. At least seven, including four children, died.At least 45 were aboard, with occupants trapped for hours at the snowy roadside in the upended vehicle until rescuers extracted them from the scene. Police have opened a criminal case against the driver and detained him for questioning. The occupants were going to a dance competition, according to the mayor of Yartsevo via news agency Interfax. Local officials said 24 people have been hospitalised, but Agence France-Presse reported as many as 32 hospitalised.The Emergency Situations Ministry stated all occupants were from Smolensk. Officials said most of the injured were minors. Russia suffers one of the highest death tolls from road accidents in the world, reportedly 18.9 deaths per 100,000 people per year; this is lower than previous years. The Emergencies Ministry has, in a statement, called on drivers to "not forget that the health and lives of other people depend on you." It also urged people to "comply with the established rules of behaviour on the road."The Emergency Situations Ministry further indicated no additional vehicles were involved and suggested the driver lost control and left the road.

On a curve in the mountainous area of Ocoña, at PAH kilometer 782, it slid off the road and fell several hundred feet (100 feet equals about 30 metres) into a ravine. The wreckage of the bus came to rest near a fast-flowing river, and some of the victims' corpses were taken along by the stream. Rescuers tried to recover bodies from the river.A death toll of 44 was established on Wednesday by the Peruvian National Police and confirmed by governor Yamila Osorio on Twitter, but officials said the toll would likely rise further. 43 of the 44 died on site, while another one died later in hospital. Four of the dead were of minor age. By varying reports more than 30 people were injured. Early reports indicated injured were taken to a hospital in Camaná. Police said they didn't know how many passengers the bus was actually carrying, as the official figure registered by Rey Latino was 45, but extra passengers had apparently boarded after the bus left Chala.Officials said the permit with which the bus was driving expired in November 2016.Peruvian President Pablo Kuczynski expressed his condolences on Twitter.

Police investigator Rana Shabbir Ahmad told the AFP news agency the bodies were of 11 women, 10 men and a child about nine years old.The bride and groom, traveling in a separate vehicle, were uninjured.A new Newsweek poll shows that President Bush's approval rating has fallen to an all-time low of 38%. The drop comes largely in response to the Bush Administration's -- and in particular, FEMA's -- inability to handle the recent rescue and recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Louisiana.The poll also shows that 57% of people have lost faith in the Administration's ability to handle a natural disaster. 52%  do not feel Bush has the ability to make good decisions in a time of crisis.The poll of 1,009 people, which has a margin of error of 4%, also showed that the country is still split on issues such as dealing with terrorism, Homeland Security, and military action in Iraq. An overwhelming 66% are not satisfied with the current direction of the country.The combination of the above issues are likely contributing to President Bush's declining approval rating. The strong and vocal criticism from Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans may be one factor in the near-term decline. Nagin has given a number of publicized interviews during the recovery crisis, and the following is from the Sunday, September 11 broadcast of MSNBC Meet The Press:MR. RUSSERT:  What's the biggest mistake you made?MAYOR NAGIN: My biggest mistake is having a fundamental assumption that in the state of Louisiana, with an $18 billion budget, in the country of the United States that can move whole fleets of aircraft carriers across the globe in 24 hours, that my fundamental assumption was get as many people to safety as possible, and that the cavalry would be coming within two to three days, and they didn't come. Responding to public criticism, President Bush stated he intends "to lead an investigation to find out what went right and what went wrong." [1] The U.S. Congress is expected to investigate the disaster response on the local, state, and federal level as soon as is practical.President Bush has asked Congress to discuss the option of allowing him to deploy military resources if avian flu breaks out in America."I'm concerned about what an avian flu outbreak could mean for the United States and the world," said the president in a conference today.  The president also expressed concern that local response would be slow, given the precedent provided by the recent gulf coast hurricane disasters, the aftermath of which has triggered widespread criticism for what many view as instances of long-delayed and inadequate delivery on the part of the white house and congress.  "I want there to be a robust discussion about the best way for the federal government, in certain extreme circumstances, to be able to rally assets for the good of the people," the President said previously.Avian flu is not currently able to easily pass from human to human, limiting epidemics.  The president and others warn that the virus may mutate into a form that more easily spreads through social contact.George W. Bush, the President of the United States, has said that he will not attend the 2008 Republican National Convention as a result of Hurricane Gustav.During a statement made to the press, Bush told reporters: "In light of these events, I will not be going to Minnesota for the Republican National Convention,".  He continued saying: "I'm going to travel down to Texas tomorrow to visit with the Emergency Operations Center in Austin, where coordination among federal, state, and local government officials is occurring.""I intend to go down to San Antonio where state and local officials are prepositioning relief materials for Texas and Louisiana, and I'll have a chance to visit with residents of both states who have been evacuated."Rick Davis, campaign manager for John McCain 2008, also tried to explain the reasons for the change of the schedule saying that "we [John McCain 2008 and the Republican Party] are deeply concerned about the safety and welfare of the residents of the Gulf State region. Our top priority is to assist those who will be affected by Hurricane Gustav. This is not a time for politics or celebration; it is a time for us to come together as Americans and assist the residents of the Gulf States."During the press statement in which Mr. Bush announced that he would not attend the conference, he also commented on the dangers of the hurricane.  "The message to the people of the Gulf Coast is, this storm is dangerous. There's a real possibility of flooding, storm surge, and high winds. Therefore, it is very important for you to follow the instructions and direction of state and local officials. Do not put yourself in harm's way, or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks. And know that the American people stand with you. We'll face this emergency together."Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana yesterady ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city ahead of Hurricane Gustav. Nagin stated that residents "need to be scared" in what he calls "the mother of all storms".George W. Bush, the president of the United States has visited Tennessee, which was hit by over 25 tornadoes which caused over 33 deaths. In the visit Mr.Bush said that “the government has got a role to play” in repairing the damage from the tornado and that anyone who has been affected should call 1-800-621-3362 to "find out the help that is available.”Mr.Bush started the speech by saying that he “looked in their [Phil and June Spears, residents of Tennessee] eyes and saw incredible sadness and worry.” He continued by saying that he believes “the Governor [of Tennessee] joins me in sharing our concerns with you.”Later in the speech Mr.Bush said that he’s “sorry you're going through what you're going through,” to the residents of Macon County, which he was visiting. He continued by saying that “life sometimes is unfair and you don't get to play the hand that you wanted to play,” and that he believes “the question is when you get dealt the hand, how do you play it?” He continued by saying that the community of Macon County “is going to be as strong as ever.”Recently emerging evidence seems to contradict a statement by United States President George W. Bush during Hurricane Katrina. He stated in an interview with ABC on September 1st that, "I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees".One of the first items to emerge, a video obtained by the Associated Press, shows footage of Bush during a video-conference received at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, on August 29, 2005, 19 hours before landfall of Hurricane Katrina. During the briefing, Director of the National Hurricane Center Max Mayfield warned, "I don't think anyone can tell you with any confidence right now whether levees will be topped or not, but there is obviously a very, very great concern".  In addition, Michael D. Brown, then director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), reported that he had spoken with President Bush twice in the morning and that the president was asking about reports that the levees had been breached.Brown would state later on CNN that, "There's no question in my mind he probably had those reports (about breaches in the levees), because we were feeding in the Homeland Security Operations Center, into the White House sit room, all of the information that we were getting. So he had to have had that information. Plus, I think the president knew from our earlier conversations that that was one of my concerns, that the levees could actually breach".[1]In July 2004, the Federal Emergency Management Agency completed an exercise called "Hurricane Pam", which, dealt with the scenario of a direct hit on New Orleans by a hurricane with 120 mph winds (a Category 3).  It resulted in "10 to 20 feet of water within the City of New Orleans," according to January 24 congressional testimony by the president of the company that designed the Hurricane Pam exercise.[2]  A report FEMA sent to the White House Situation Room on August 29th, they cited death and destruction anticipated by the "Hurricane Pam" exercise and warned that Katrina was likely to be worse.  "Exercise projection is exceeded by Hurricane Katrina real-life impacts," they stated.  Furthermore, "The potential for severe storm surge to overwhelm Lake Pontchartrain levees is the greatest concern for New Orleans.  Any storm rated Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson (hurricane) scale will likely lead to severe flooding and/or levee breaching. This could leave the New Orleans metro area submerged for weeks or months".[3]When the report was released, Hurricane Katrina was thought to be a Category 4 as of landfall (though after analysis, it's power at landfall would be downgraded to a Category 3).[4]  White House officials previously clarified Bush's earlier comment, saying that the president was referring to the hours after Katrina swept through and news reports as of August 30th suggested the city had "dodged a bullet", which led to surprise when reports reached them of the levee breaches.[5][6]  Contrasting this was the August 30th broadcast of NBC's Today, NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams reported at 7:05 a.m. ET, "There has been a huge development overnight ... the historic French Quarter, dry last night and it is now filling with water. This is water from nearby Lake Pontchartrain; the levees failed overnight."[7]At McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California, United States, a Cessna 560 twin engine jet skidded off the runway and burst into flames immediately after. Four people were killed in the accident.The Associated Press reports that the plane had run through a barricade and fell down a 100-150 foot cliff, which left parts of the plane in a trail behind it. It then hit the side of the Carlsbad Airport Self-Storage building before it came to a stop in a twisted metal ball of flame. One of the victims was Janet Shafran who was the wife of Ketchum City Councilman Steven Shafran. The Union Leader, a Manchester, New Hampshire newspaper, also reports that another one of the victims was Frank H. Jellinek, Jr., of Hampton, N.H. According to the Union Leader, Jellinek was one of the state's most prominent corporate executives. Jellinek Jr. was chairman emeritus of Fisher Scientific in Hampton since Aug. 2, 2004.By the end of the day Tuesday, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's office had not yet confirmed the identities of the two pilots who were also killed. They are believed to be local residents.On Tuesday, an Indonesian Air Force C-130 Hercules crashed in the city of Medan, Indonesia. All 122 people on board were killed as well as people on the ground in the city in North Sumatra, according to North Sumatra police Major A. Tarigan. Officials said the plane exploded on impact into a big fireball.The military said the plane took off at 12:08 pm local time (0508 UTC) and crashed five kilometers away a couple of minutes later. According to Agus Supriatna, chief of the Air Force, the pilot reported technical problems and requested return to base. The aircraft was en route from Soewondo Air Force Base to Natuna. The air force first said there were twelve crew members on board, but the total number of reported fatalities continued to change with later reports. Police found even more dead bodies from the crash on the ground, raising the reported death toll as high as 142 people. Some bodies have been identified by blood sampling, an official told newspaper Jakarta Globe.There were some allegations that passengers on the aircraft were not limited to military families. The military is not allowed to fly civilian passengers, according to the air force chief, unless they are related to military personnel, or under some special circumstances. The chief is looking into these allegations to see if there were paying passengers.An AirAsia jet crashed in the Java Sea last December, killing everyone aboard.The cause of this C-130 crash has yet to be determined.A Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, operated by the United States Air Force, crashed on Wednesday near Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska at about 6:15 pm (0215 Thursday UTC), killing all four crew members. The plane was practicing for the 2010 Arctic Thunder air show.These facts were confirmed by Air Force Lt. Gen. Dana Atkins, Commander of Alaskan Command NORAD, in an impromptu press conference later in the evening. Col. John McMullen, commander of the 3rd Wing (under whose authority the plane belonged), announced the four deaths on Thursday. Three were members of the U.S. Air National Guard, one was active duty. Names are being withheld pending the notification of family members.The Elmendorf base is near Anchorage, Alaska, and the fireball and plume were visible from that city's downtown. "It was a big, gray plume of smoke and I saw a fireball go up in it," said Anchorage Fire Dept. Captain Bryan Grella in an interview with the Associated Press.The Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircraft is designed for rapid response strategic airlift, medical evacuation, and airdrop roles, carrying cargo and troops. The aircraft are used by the United States, the United Kingdom, NATO, Australia, Canada, and Qatar.The Pentagon confirmed that a C-5 Galaxy military cargo plane crashed at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, saying that the plane was having "mechanical problems" and crashed "while taking off." The plane was carrying 17 people.ABC News reported no fatalities, but Allen Metheny, assistant director in the State Department, said that some were injured and taken to the hospital; the extent of the injuries was unknown. At least 10 people have been reported to have been taken to BayHealth hospital.The plane crashed about 6:45 a.m. EDT (1045 UTC) and broke into three separate sections. The C-5 Galaxy is the largest plane in operation in the U.S. military.Raymond Lee Oyler of California, United States has been convicted of the murders of five US Forest Service firefighters killed while attempting to control a wildfire he had lit.Oyler, 38, set the Esperanza Fire out of anger his dog had been impounded, according to prosecutors. The October 2006 blaze destroyed 34 houses and 20 outbuildings, scorching over 17,400 hectares. Prosecutors said he was "bent on destruction".Prosecutors also alleged Oyler started the fire at night specifically to leave firefighters "on their own" without aerial support. He was identified as the arsonist behind the fire after a security camera saw his car several times and samples taken from the scene matched those found in his girlfriend's house. Oyler, an unemployed car mechanic, was also identified by the owner of a local petrol station as having stood in a car park and watched the fire's spread.The five firefighters that were killed died when their truck was overrun by the flames. Oyler was convicted of murdering them on Friday March 6 after a six-week trial in Riverside California. The twelve-member jury took nearly a week of deliberation before returning the guilty verdict, and will meet to hear arguments regarding Oyler's sentence on Tuesday. He may face the death penalty.His defense had admitted Oyler likely started several fires in the Riverside County area, but denied he had started the one that killed the firefighters.California Senator Carole Migden has revealed that she is suffering from leukemia and that medication prescribed to her may have contributed to a car accident she caused on May 18. Earlier Migden said that she was driving her state-leased SUV while reaching for her cell phone.The announcement comes when witnesses called police to say that Migden was weaving along Highway 12 in Solano County, California. They also reported that she drove over the center median on several occasions and that after the accident she got out of her car and proceeded to yell, "I'm a senator!." Witnesses say that she "didn't seem all there at the time."According to Migden, doctors diagnosed her with leukemia in 1997, but did not reveal to the public her disease because she did not want "pity" from anyone. Migden also says that back in February, she was pronounced as "disease free."Migden says that she had an unexplained medical event and that her medication claim is not an excuse for her driving."I owe an explanation to the public and myself and, in particular, the person I hurt. I don't have a recollection of what happened. I can only conclude I had a medical event I can't explain. It's not an excuse; it may be an explanation," said Migden.Authorities have stated that they recommended charges of "unsafe driving" be filed against Migden, but that the incident still be investigated.At least 400 homes have been evacuated in Sierra Madre near Los Angeles, California after a wildfire which started on Saturday, began to threaten their homes.So far only five percent of the 350 acre fire is contained, with over 400 firefighters battling the blaze. Authorities say that it has been over 40 years since some parts of the land have caught fire.The cause of the fire is not known. Authorities say the investigation into how it started may take up to three days to finish.So far there have been no injuries and no homes have yet been damaged, but one building storing equipment used by firefighters was burned to the ground. For a short time, at least 100 hikers were trapped in the mountains and a boy scout camp was also threatened by the blaze. Several people celebrating a wedding have also been trapped by the fire but are not injured and authorities say they are in no danger from the blaze.  However, there are currently around 1000 people under mandatory evacuations, and the city has been declared in a state of emergency.It could take at least five days before the fire can be brought under full control.A wildfire has been reported near Palm Springs, California. At least 4 United States Forest Service firefighters were killed and 1 seriously injured, with burns on nearly 95% of his body.  The firefighters were overcome by fire while attempting to put out a blaze inside a home. The fire has burned nearly 10,000 acres and has destroyed 5 houses including 5 other buildings."We had a lot of fire activity overnight. Normally the fire dies down and the winds let up but that didn't happen last night. It burned like it was daytime," said California Department of Forestry spokesman, Bill Peters."[The] chances of survival are low when you have that bad of an injury," said Arrowhead Regional Medical Centre surgeon, Doctor Dev Gnanadev who also added that the firefighter has suffered "severe respiratory damage."Witnesses have reported that 2 males were seen leaving the area of the fire at 1:00 a.m. on Thursday morning.Authorities have determined that the blaze was due to arson and are offering a $500,000 [USD] reward for information leading to an arrest, but no information on how or why the fire was set has been released. Authorities say that murder could be among the arson charges who whoever is responsible."This is an arson fire. This is a deliberately set arson fire," said California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention, John Hawkins.Nearly 1,000 people have been evacuated from the area.In Yucca Valley, California, USA, wildfires destroyed nearly 110 square miles of land (285 square km), burning over 45,000 acres (182 square km), as the outcome of two wildfires merging into one. Current conditions could only make it worse.Over 3,000 firefighters and 36 aircraft were sent to fight the blaze, which some predicted would reach all the way to Big Lear Lake, a popular summer getaway vacation area, about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, California (129 km). Temperatures there reached up to 112°F (44.5°C).Firefighters fighting the wildfire have successfully stopped it from burning the resort and other communities nearby in its path.The continuous winds and the intense heat would only mean that the blaze would last even longer and call for more firefighters to overtake the flames.California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency for San Bernardino County as a result of the wildfires.Wildfires in California continued to spread on Tuesday, having burned more than 140,000 acres of land throughout the state and caused an estimated US$13 million worth of damage.  The blaze started burning last Wednesday north of Los Angeles.Emergency crews said they were hopeful that they would be able to control the fire. 3,600 personnel are involved in containing the wildfire. Currently, twenty-two percent of the blaze is contained, rising from only five percent as little as a day ago.Changing weather conditions also helped firefighting efforts, as temperature in the area fell to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, down from over a hundred degrees on Monday."I'm feeling a lot more optimistic today than I did yesterday. The crews are doing fabulous work out there on the ground, but the bottom line is that they're fighting for every foot," Dietrich said on Tuesday.In a statement, Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said that "[his administration] is working around the clock to ensure that our brave men and women working on the fires front lines have the resources needed to respond and beat back these fires as quickly as possible.""We have the toughest and best-trained firefighters in the world fighting to protect public safety and property. I am confident in the state's response as these fires continue to burn throughout California," he said.Two firefighters were killed in the blaze on Sunday, after fires burnt their vehicle on front lines. Over 10,000 residents have evacuated areas threatened by the flames.Australia is calling for criminal charges to be made in light of the final report into the Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 disaster, which was published yesterday. Five Australians were among the 21 killed when the Boeing 737 jetliner overshot the runway at Adisucipto International Airport, near Yogyakarta, Indonesia on March 7 this year.Australian Minister for Foreign affairs, Alexander Downer, said that the "very credible report" made it clear the two-man cockpit crew were responsible for the accident. The report found that alarms sounded no less than 15 times to warn the pilot in command that he was flying at an excessive speed for proper operation of the flaps, and that the co-pilot had also been ignored when he asked for a go-around to be made. The co-pilot was criticised for not taking control of the aircraft. The pilot was found to have ignored 15 emergency activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System telling him to slow down. Other criticisms were leveled at the inadequate training provided by the airline, the inadequate inspections by authorities, the lack of a mandatory runoff area at the runway and improper fire suppressants and slow response from the Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting facilities at the airport."I've asked our ambassador today to make it absolutely clear to the Indonesians that we want people prosecuted for this accident," said Downer. "I want to see people who have negligently allowed Australians … to be killed, I want to see those people brought to justice," he added. He has also expressed a pledge to discuss plans for a class action suit with survivors and relatives of victims, but he commented that "you're dealing with the Indonesian system here, it's a different system from our own, so it's not necessarily going to be very easy." Bill Madden from the law firm Slater and Gordon, who have a speciality in class actions, disagreed: "It would seem as though the families and people injured would have a fairly strong case," he said. "You'd be holding an airline responsible for the negligence of a pilot and that's a fairly standard approach that the law can follow."Meanwhile, the Sydney Morning Herarld spoke with Ari Sapari, head of operations at Garuda Indonesia. He told reporters that the pilots, who remain grounded after the crash, may be sacked next week, when any disciplinary action is expected to be announced. However, if they are charged over the crash, he has promised the airline will assist in their defence, saying "They are still our employees, up to now. They have the right to be assisted." Police say they are examining closely the possibility of charging both with manslaughter, which could see them sent to prison for up to five years if convicted. When queried about the fact that the report found the crew had not received adequate simulator training from the airline, he defended the company, saying "Nobody is perfect in this entire world." Since the suspension of the pilots, all other Garuda pilots have undergone the appropriate training missed out by Garuda.Australian Prime Minister John Howard said in a statement made after the report came out "I am quite astonished. I can understand how people who are still grieving, both in Indonesia and Australia, might feel." The Opposition Leader, Kevin Rudd, has said he has telephoned secretary-general of Indonesia's foreign affairs department and former ambassador to Australia Imron Cotan, telling him that he wanted those responsible "prosecuted to the absolute full". "This is a serious matter, many Australians visit Indonesia, Garuda is an often used airline and there is a basic national interest at stake here as well," he said.It is, however, stipulated in the Convention on International Civil Aviation that accident reports and related material, specifically transcripts of interviews, communications with crew and cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder (collectively known as black boxes) readouts, must not be used for any purpose other than determining the cause of an accident or incident. The only possible exception to this is where potential benefit would outweigh the "adverse domestic and international impact" on the investigation in question or any other either in progress or in the future. This legislation is in place to provide protection to witnesses on the basis that without it they may be less likely to cooperate with investigational procedures.Downer's response to this law was to comment that "I think our first priority is to make sure those who are responsible - who survived the accident - are brought to justice." Aridono Sukman, the police member in charge of the criminal investigation, has said that the contents of the black box are vital evidence. Officials have commented that some relatives have expressed their frustration over the legal challenges involved in the prosecution effort.Tatang Kurniadi, chairman of the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, has already confirmed that investigators cannot speak to the police, with the only permitted testimony under the legislation being to testify at a court hearing. He also pointed out that the document does not actually appoint any blame. "The investigation determined the flight crews' compliance with procedures was not at the level to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. That's enough," he said. However, Sisno Adiwinoto, a police spokesperson, told reporters the police would attempt to summon the investigators to court as expert witnesses on aviation, rather than as the actual investigators involved with the disaster.Another fact that has become apparent is that the runway at Adisucipto International will not be lengthened to meet international standards despite assurances that work would begin shortly. The airport claims it cannot build the mandatory 90-metre runway end safety area because, says a small-print comment by the state-owned airport operator, the airport does not have the land." It has, however, promised to bring other airports under its jurisdiction up to standard, with work initialising next year. The company has also stated that a study of engineering methods providing alternative solutions could be completed by June.Two U.S. Marines were killed at Camp Pendleton, California when their AH-1W Cobra Helicopter, belonging to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, crashed on Monday at about 1 p.m. local time. The crash occurred in the southeast corner of the base, near the community of Fallbrook.The Marines were pronounced dead at the scene. They were named as Captain Jeffrey Bland and First Lieutenant Thomas Heitmann.The crash started a brush fire that reportedly spread to about 50 acres in three hours, later 120 acres, but was about 80% contained, within the base, by Monday evening.  The Fallbrook Fire Department and U.S. Forest Service are assisting.The crash is the latest in a series of accidents in southern California involving U.S. Marine Corps flight training. An investigation is still underway to discover what caused this latest accident. The Marines have ordered an "operational pause" for all training flights for the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. The pause also applies to aircraft training at the Yuma and Miramar bases as well as Camp Pendleton.The campaign offices for 2008 United States presidential candidate John McCain in Centennial, Colorado and Manchester, New Hampshire have been evacuated after receiving letter threats in the U.S. mail. Office staff state that the Centennial envelope contained an unknown white powder."We immediately notified local and federal law enforcement agencies and are looking to cooperate with them. We have put all of our offices on highest alert. They're looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now," said Jeff Sadosky, a spokesman for the McCain campaign.There are currently no reports of injuries, but "staffs were immediately transported to a local hospital," added Sadosky. At least four people had to go through decontamination as a precaution. Authorities say that preliminary tests performed on the powder contained in the Centennial letter appears to be a protein and is not dangerous."We have not found anything hazardous in the initial testing, in the initial examination we did. We have no reports of anybody being sick," said Parker South Metro Fire Rescue Authority spokesman Andy Lyon who also said that authorities only found small granules of an alleged powder. The Manchester envelope was also given the all clear and no substance was found inside.According to 9news.com, the letter in Centennial came from an unknown individual who is being held in Arapahoe County Jail. 9news.com describes the individual as a "prolific letter writer". The letter in Manchester contained a return address for Denver, but authorities say that the two incidents are not related. The Democratic National Convention is set to begin in Denver in just four days.The Canadian Government is watching the "slowing growth" of the BP oil spill. Canada is running their dash-8 on a twice a day mission to the gulf, monitoring for signs that the BP Oil slick may expand up the Eastern seaboard into Canadian waters, and to provide assistance to US efforts to contain the spill. This started in May, and is expected to continue until the spill has been fully contained, or no longer needed. Canada has also provided technical experts, research and development teams, and general staffing to assist in spill containment and cleanup. While the risk is slim that the oil slick will move up the seaboard enough to get into Canadian waters, it is possible. Currently the spill is being held within the Gulf of Mexico, however, as the spill grows each day it is at bigger risk of being picked up by the Loop Current. "If oil is swept up into the Loop Current—which moves at about 3.3 to 6.5 feet (one to two meters) a second—there's essentially no way to stop it," Tony Sturges, professor emeritus of oceanography at Florida State University, told National Geographic. "Once [oil] gets into the loop current, you can bet the farm it will go around to the south" After being picked up by the Loop Current, the oil spill could then quickly be carried further by the Gulf Stream, which can travel up to 2.5 metres per second (5.6 mph). This current leads right through some of Canada's best fishing waters, and could potentially even be washed up directly onto the shores of Canada, if not properly contained.This spill could devastate the fishing industry of Canada, and harm any potential tourism on the beautiful coastal waters of Eastern Canada. So while Canada is offering its hand to the United States as a gesture of assistance, it serves dually as a self assurance that Canada will not be affected by the spill, and to stop it before it reaches the border if it does get picked up by the currents.Currently, there are blackouts, heavy rain, and high winds in British Columbia. Over 220,000 BC Hydro customers have no power. Buildings have already collapsed and trees have been knowed down. Five Vancouver rivers were in danger of flooding, which rain fell at 10 mm an hour for more than six hours at midday.The steel frame of a four-storey building under construction in Vancouver collapsed. Construction workers escaped injury, luckily they were on a coffee break at the time of the incident. The steel frame crushed cars in a parking lot and missed a truck driver.Citizens had to evacuate a subdivision of 30 homes. The winds smashed trees into houses in West Vancouver."We have some real fears here with electrical problems," said Captain Rob Jones Cook of the Vancouver Fire Department. "This is impinging on electrical poles and lamp standards. We also have hydro bus lines running down two sides of the building." The Vancouver Fire Department says they have no idea as to why the building collapsed.Winds are gusting at more than 100 kilometres an hour (62 mph) in some areas and rainfall amounts of 50 to 130 millimetres.According BC Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Moreno, the hardest-hit areas are Vancouver, Surrey, Langley, Abbotsford and Mission, B.C. "We're trying to be optimistic and hoping it's by end of day today, but there may very well be customers that are into the early-morning hours before restoration," Moreno said.Extensive ferry cancellations, road closures, and massive power outages are in effect until the storm ends.The RCMP have advised people to stay home and off the highway.The same heavy weather has also affected nearby Washington State, USA.As the Canadian Forces were assuring the nation that they felt the Taliban incapable of launching a spring offensive, and talked of launching a new strike against insurgent forces in Afghanistan, a convoy of Canadian Coyotes and Nyalas was ambushed in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Two separate RPG attacks were made by the Taliban as the Canadians held to their route. The second attack came when vehicles damaged during the first barrage broke down and presented an easy target for the Taliban fighters. No Canadians were killed in the attacks, or in the small-arms skirmish that followed, but an Afghan civilian was shot by Canadian troops when he reportedly ignored warnings and approached the Canadians. An Afghan police officer was also killed during the firefight.Canadian cruise ship MS Explorer is sinking in Antarctic waters, near the South Shetland Islands. Having struck an unknown underwater object and taking on water, all but the captain and chief officer of the 156 on board, have abandoned ship for life boats and await rescue. Despite having a strong reinforced ice breaking hull, the ship is said to be listing heavily and expected to sink soon. A cruise ship in the vicinity, the Antarctic Dream, has been diverted to help but is not expected to arrive until at least 11.00 hours UTC. Four Argentine vessels were also dispatched but are not expected to arrive for some time.The rescue effort is an international affair, being undertaken by the Argentine Coast Guard, with help from the U.S. Coast Guard in Norfolk, Virginia, and the U.K. Coast Guard in Falmouth  in an advisory capacity.Two life boats were empty, one person is dead and sixteen others are missing after a helicopter crashed into the frigid north Atlantic Ocean reported search and rescue official, March 12. The Sikorsky S92 helicopter sunk below the surface and the debris field was located about 47 nautical miles (87 km; 54 mi) southeast of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.Maydays and alerts were sent at 9:18 local NL time (7:48 EST). The helicopter pilot radioed his intent to return to St. John's.File:CHC S-92.jpgThe lone survivor, Robert Decker, was taken to a local hospital in critical condition. He was rescued by a helicopter which arrived 45 minutes after take off.Of the eighteen people on board one other body was found and taken to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. The cause of the crash is under investigation, but Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper called the incident a "tragic accident". Julie Leroux of the Transportation Safety Board said that mechanical problems were reported on the helicopter, but further investigation was needed.Earlier reports stated that two people and a life raft were seen in the waters 87 kilometers (54 miles) southeast of St. John's. There were reports of a second life raft as well. Rescuers soon discovered that the life rafts were empty.For those wearing survival suits, the survival time would be approximately 24 hours. Wave heights at the time of the crash were six to nine feet (two to three meters), with freezing water temperatures. As a result, emergency rooms at St. John's hospital were prepared for survivors suffering from hypothermia reported Deborah Collins of the Eastern Health Board.  On board were workers heading to two offshore oilfields, mainly the Sea Rose platform, a part of the White Rose offshore oilfield 315 kilometers (196 miles) southeast of St. John's. Two people on board were staff of Cougar Helicopters, and two passengers traveling to the Hibernia platform.Two Cormorant rescue helicopters and one military Hercules plane flew into high winds during the rescue effort. The search and rescue team was supplemented by a coast guard ship and supply ship. There were reports that two other helicopters were dispatched as well.Operation NANOOK 2008 was held from August 11 to August 25 by the Canadian Forces for the purpose of conducting mock emergency rescue operations for potential maritime disasters in the northeastern Canadian Arctic waters.  Two Canadian navy ships and two airforce planes, a CC-138 Twin Otter and a CP-140 Aurora, took part in the exercises in the Canada's Arctic.  The HMCS Toronto and the Canadian Coast Guard ship Pierre Radisson travelled along the Hudson Strait.  The Operation extended to Davis Strait, and Frobisher Bay during the annual NANOOK Operation.  There have been 18 such humanitarian operations since 2002. As more Arctic ice melts, the ships sail through uncharted waters. Emergency response times were tested for such potential disasters as oil spills, or rescue operations such as responding to cruise ship emergencies. General Walter Natynczyk, Canada's chief of Defence staff,  the Honourable Peter MacKay, Defence Minister as well as Minister of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, and  Steven Fletcher, Member of Parliament for Charleswood–St. James–Assiniboia and Parliamentary Secretary for Health, flew to Iqaluit, Nunavut to officially launch the exercise on August 19, 2008 and observe the process. In addition to the military exercises, Veterans Affairs Canada held a commemorative event onboard the HMCS Toronto to honour the 55th Anniversary of the Cease Fire in Korea, the 65th Anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic, and the start of the Last 100 days of the First World War.  The inaugural ceremonies were held during Community Day activities in the capital city of Iqaluit, followed by the public panel discussion held on Saturday.  The community day ceremonies were organized by participants in Operation NANOOK 2008.  The public ceremonies received neither Nunavut politicians nor Inuit leaders.Bloc Quebecois Member of Parliament Benoit Sauvageau was killed in an automobile accident on Monday morning after his vehicle hit a tow truck at the side of a road in his Montreal constituency. Sauvageau, 42, had been an MP since 1993 and represented the riding of Repentigny at the time of his death. Bloc Québécois (BQ) Leader Gilles Duceppe, speaking in Quebec City, remembered Sauvageau as a hard-working representative who was widely respected "not only in the sovereigntist camp but by his adversaries who always recognized him for his honesty and his determination.""I think he was a very good member of Parliament, a very good sovereigntist," added Duceppe. Visibly shaken by the news, Duceppe said: "It's awful, at 42 with four children (daughters) between the ages of five and 15, it's not right."Former Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, who led the BQ when Sauvageau was first elected, told Radio Canada: "It's a tragedy. It's unbelievable that he died like that.""He is a man who was engaged in political fights but he did it correctly, with nobility and idealism and a lot of respect for others, even his adversaries," said Bouchard.Sauvageau was a history professor before entering politics. As an MP he was the Bloc's spokesperson on public accounts and the treasury board and was also the party's critic responsible for the Official Languages Act and the rights of Francophones outside of Quebec."On behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada and our Parliamentary caucus, I would like to express my deepest sadness and regret at the news of the death of Benoît Sauvageau in a tragic car accident in Repentigny this afternoon," said interim Liberal leader Bill Graham.Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the prayers and thoughts of all Parliamentarians are with Sauvageau's loved ones at this difficult time.File:Media 2011 Picture (Leg) Bhullar Headshot.jpgA road accident killed Alberta Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Manmeet Bhullar on Monday. Bhullar pulled over to the median on a snowy stretch of the Queen Elizabeth II highway between Edmonton and Calgary to help a fellow motorist who had gone off the road, before a semi-truck lost control and hit him. Bhullar died at hospital at the age of 35.Bhullar represented the Calgary-Greenway electoral district, and was a member of the Progressive Conservative party. His family received condolences from his colleagues after his death.Bhullar became the first turban-wearing Sikh in the Alberta cabinet in 2011, as Minister of Service, and held cabinet positions until earlier this year. According to Calgary mayor Nasheed Nenshi, Bhullar was influenced to enter politics by early experiences of coping with others' discomfort about Sikhs.Bhullar was "a true warrior for fairness and justice, a big man with a giant heart, a friend", said Nenshi. In a teleconference with journalists, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley recognised him for his work in making the governmental system more transparent.Notley said she "quite frankly [expected] to see Manmeet in public life for decades to come. And I believe all Albertans are poorer for the fact we will not."Wednesday, a Canadian soldier died in a non-combat related incident after falling from a communications tower in Afghanistan."It was not operationally related at this time. It was simply, unfortunately an accident," Col. Mike Cessford said. "I would stress that we take every precaution to minimize the dangers to our soldiers. However, risk is inherent in the nature of the work that we do."The soldier's name will not be released until the other relatives have been notified due to the family's request.This is the first non-combat related incident in Kandahar. Most Canadian forces are based at Kandahar Airfield as part of the International Security Assistance Force.Most Canadian soldiers' deaths were in bomb attacks and/or during combat. Fifty-four Canadian soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the mission began in 2002.Thirteen Canadian soldiers sustained minor injuries yesterday when three light armoured vehicles (LAV III) smashed into each other in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The LAV IIIs are reported to have sustained minor damage.Seven soldiers were taken to the Canadian-run provincial reconstruction base medical clinic. Six soldiers were transferred by air to the NATO hospital in Kandahar airfield.The soldiers, who arrived in Afghanistan this month, are from the 2nd Battalion Royal Canadian Regiment and reserve units around Atlantic Canada.."Our soldiers receive excellent training before they're deployed to theatre, but I don't think anything can quite fully prepare anyone for the nature of the roads here in Kandahar," said a spokesman for the Canadian Forces, Major Dale MacEachern.They are now safe and will return to their units in a couple of days.A Canadian soldier, Pte. Mark Anthony Graham of Hamilton, Ontario, was killed and more than 30 were wounded, five seriously, in Afghanistan today in an incident being described as "friendly fire". The Canadian soldiers came under cannon fire from NATO airplanes, reported to be two U.S. A-10 Thunderbolts, also known as the Warthog. Brigadier-General David Fraser, the Canadian commander of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in southern Afghanistan said an investigation has been ordered; "An aircraft flying in support of ISAF operations accidentally engaged a Canadian position in Panjwaii at approximately 5:30 this morning, killing one soldier and wounding a number of others. An investigation has been ordered into this event and while this event is tragic, Operation Medusa and the Canadians continue to operate in the Panjwaii district in support of Afghan government efforts to rid the area of Taliban." "We've got to find out what were the details there." said Fraser. "We do have procedures, we do have communications, we do have training and tactics and techniques and procedures to mitigate the risk, but we can't reduce those risks to zero."Four Canadian soldiers were killed in a 2002 "friendly fire" incident when they were bombed by an American F-16 fighter plane.Gary Foster, a British cancer patient, has died after a hospital computer error. The twenty-seven-year-old was undergoing a trial at the University College London Hospital when an apparent computer system error led to him repeatedly receiving double the amount of chemotherapy needed.Foster had been treated for testicular cancer since June. He had improved temporarily after the overdose but died due to drug toxicity. Another patient suffered an overdose during the trial but survived.Gary Foster was engaged, with wedding plans this month. He had been working as a graphic designer when he was diagnosed with cancer and a sixty percent survival rate. According to his fiancée, Paula Collins, the couple had been relieved to be included in drug trials as they had been told his chances of survival would increase. He had slowly received the overdoses over a period of four months. His mother said he had been "slowly poisoned."University College London Hospital reviewed its procedures and has made sufficient changes for future patient safety. The lesson it has learned, hospital officials stated, was to include "a second separate check by senior pharmacy staff  … for every patient before repeated doses are given." Suspected overdoses were reported through written letters, which hospital staff left unopened for two days.While a coroner's report is in progress, investigators said the drug had not directly caused Foster's death despite his health deteriorating after the overdoses began.An elderly Brooklyn, New York woman was found dead yesterday after a fire triggered by a voodoo ceremony caused a blaze in an apartment that left dozens homeless. The details of the ceremony were not clear, but  sources say it  led to sex.An unidentified woman hired a Voodoo priest for $300, identified as Nelson (Pepe) Pierre, to perform a mystic ceremony  meant to bring her good luck.  The woman went to  Pierre's apartment, where she ended up in bed surrounded by  lit candles which were mistakenly knocked over,  setting the bedsheets on fire.  In an effort to suppress the flames, Pierre splashed water from the bathroom sink on the sheets while his roommate, who was ironing at the time,  opened a window for air.  However, according to the New York Fire Department, wind gusting through the open window created a "blowtorch effect" which caused the fire to spread to the 4th floor hallway and into the 5th and 6th floors.  The blaze killed one woman, three others were severely injured, and at least 20 firefighters were left with burn wounds.In an NYFD statement, Fire Commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano said, "Time and time again we respond to tragedies that could have been so easily prevented.  This fire had so many of those elements ... hopefully others will learn from this tragedy."  It took hours for hundreds of firemen from dozens of companies to bring the raging fire under control.Pierre, a man in his 60s, did not call 911 right away, but attempted to quell the fire  using water from the bathroom sink.  A source in law enforcement said, "Nobody sees a crime right now.  It was an accident.  Maybe they weren't careful, but they did try to put it out."Mary Feagin, a 64-year old retired teacher, died in the blaze. The New York Police Department is currently investigating the incident.In light of an oil spill that occurred off the coast of southeast Queensland in 2009, a captain of a cargo ship and four companies are set to appear in court.In March of last year, the cargo ship Pacific Adventurer, with Filipino national Bernardino Gonzales Santos at the helm, encountered bad weather, which resulted in its fuel tank being damaged by loose cargo, leading to the spillage 270,000 litres of oil into the Pacific Ocean. The oil later washed up on Sunshine Coast beaches as well as Moreton and Bribie islands and was dubbed "one of Australia's worse environmental disasters" by the media.Santos and four companies behind Pacific Adventurer face individual counts of discharging oil into the ocean and can be fined a maximum of AU$1.75 million in the case of the companies, while Santos faces a $350,000 fine if found guilty.Santos is also charged with not taking reasonable action following the incident.Richard Kendall, an executive of one of the involved companies, Swire Shipping LTD, said today that "[w]e are deeply regretful. But we will vigorously defend the charges [...] We stand by Captain Santos, who is a first-class captain".Like Swire Shipping, China Navigation Company LTD and Bluewing Shipping LTD, who are both joint owners of Pacific Adventurer, pleaded not guilty to all charges.However, prosecutor Peter Davis stated that "[t]he prosecution's case is that the cause of the cargo going overboard was due to faulty lashings [...] By failing to maintain the lashings, the defendants acted recklessly," an act that prosecutors say should see the companies and captain pay.The captain of a USA Jet Airlines McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-15 freighter has been killed and the co-pilot seriously injured after the aircraft crashed onto a highway in Mexico. The crash occurred near Jose Lopez Portillo and split the aircraft into four main pieces.The accident at 0:14 local time yesterday left debris strewn across a 600-metre radius. The co-pilot was hospitalised in a critical condition with second and third degree burns, but is expected to recover. The plane had picked up four tons of car parts in Hamilton, Ontario and after making a stop at Shreveport, Louisiana was headed toward Plan de Guadalupe International Airport, which serves Mexico's Saltillo city.The crash occurred around twelve kilometres from the runway. An investigation has been launched and the Public Ministry and the Civil Aeronautic Authority say an engine failure seems to have left the plane uncontrollable. The deceased has been identified as 46-year-old Lon McIntosh, and the co-pilot Chris James, was listed in critical condition after undergoing surgery at a Saltillo hospital.The jet was registered N199US. Because the plane was registered and manufactured in the United States, and the engines were built there, a team from the US has been sent to assist Mexico in the investigation. The US National Transportation Safety Board has sent a senior investigator as the US representative, and he brings with him experts in weather and aircraft systems. Also on the team are technical advisors from the Federal Aviation Authority, manufacturer Boeing (who bought out McDonnell-Douglas) and engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.The highway, which leads to Monterrey, was blocked as a result of the crash.The captain and five of his crew on Sea Diamond have been charged following the cruise ship's collision with a known and well-charted reef. The charges laid against the captain were "causing a shipwreck through negligence". Additional charges of breaching shipping safety regulations and pollution were laid against the captain. All six accused were released shortly after questioning and their full testimony will be taken in the following weeks.At the time of the crash the ship had been a few kilometers away from the dock under the spectacular cliffs that make Santorini one of Greece's top tourist destinations. At the time of the collision the Sea Diamond was carrying more than 1,500 people, 1,154 passengers and 391 crew members.The damaged vessel was quickly evacuated in a 3 hour operation, but it failed to find Jean-Christophe Allain, 45, and his 16 year old daughter, Maud, both from the Doué-la-Fontaine state in western France.A 3 day search and rescue has failed to find them with officials stating that a robot submarine would investigate the wreck, which is lying under 330 feet (100 meters) of water, within the following weeks. The panicked evacuation soon brought to the fore memories of the September 2000 Express Samina ferry shipwreck of the island of Paros, killing 80 people. The spokesman for the Cyprus based operator, Louis Cruise lines, read out a statement saying that the company was working closely with Greek investigators. The Sea Diamond, a 21 year old vessel sank at the end of a four day cruise, which included visits to Rhodes, Patios, Crete and Mykonos islands. Officials at the Greek Tourism board went into damage control to lessen the impact on its industry which accounts for 18 percent of its GDP (Gross Domestic Product).Reports say that a subway train and a car have collided in downtown Buffalo, New York.Witnesses say that calls to 911 came in just before 12:00 p.m. [EST] that a car had driven onto the tracks of the Metro Rail operated by the Niagra Frontier Transit Authority at the Theatre District rail stop which is near West Tupper and Main Streets in Downtown Buffalo.The train was traveling on the northbound track toward the Allen Medical Station when the vehicle apparently began to drive norhtbound away from the train. The train did stop but still managed to make light contact with the vehicle from behind.The driver of the car is reported to be a 73 year-old male who was not injured in the accident but is currently being evaluated at Erie County Medical Center. Witnesses say the man was "out of it" when police arrived. It is unknown if charges will be filed against the driver.There were no injuries to passengers and witnesses have stated that all the passengers on the train were evacuated.Buffalo is now the smallest city in the U.S. to have a subway system.According to a police source, at several people have been killed and a further 45 wounded after a car bomb went off in the Iraqi town of Tuz Khurmato, located about 170 kilometres (105 miles) north of Baghdad. Conflicting media reports put the number of dead between two and five.The bomb reportedly was in a parked vehicle near the residence of Niazi Mohammed, a provincial council official, and damaged many homes upon detonation. Police official Colonel Hussein al-Bayati commented that women and children were among the casualties.al-Bayati added that the home of Turkmen councillor Niazar Nomaroglu was severely damaged as well, although it wasn't immediately clear whether Nomaroglu had been killed.A car bomb has exploded in Diyarbakir, a city in the southeastern part of Turkey. According to the prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at least 4 people have died in the attack and 52 others have been injured.The bombing, which took place in the city center, approximately 100 yards from a military post, was apparently targeting a passing military vehicle. Many Turkish troops currently fighting rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) are based in the city, which also has a large Kurdish population.The prime minister blamed the attack on terrorists in a nationally televised speech, while other authorities placed the blame on Kurdish rebels. Two suspects have been apprehended by police."Such events will not disrupt our determination against terrorism. Our struggle both on international and national levels will continue with the same determination." Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.The explosion occurred at 4:55 p.m. local time, and could be heard up to two miles away. Several cars were engulfed in flames and windows shattered from the force of the blast.Two of the dead were reportedly soldiers. Among the injured were students attending a nearby private school at the time of the explosion.A car bomb has exploded outside an army base in Northern Ireland that is the headquarters for MI5 domestic security services. The attack has been claimed by dissidents from the Real Irish Republican Army, a more radical splinter group of the IRA.According to police, Real IRA members hijacked a vehicle from a taxi driver in Belfast; Al Jazeera reports it was commandeered at gunpoint. A bomb was planted in the car, which was then driven to the rear of the Palace Barracks.The explosion comes several hours before the Northern Ireland Assembly was scheduled to appoint its first justice minister, and only minutes after the Belfast power-sharing administration regained control over justice and policing in the province for the first time in nearly four decades.An Ulster Unionist member of the Belfast Policing Board, Basil McCrea, commented on the explosion, saying: "It's obviously people trying to make a statement about the transfer of policing and justice powers. We are going to have to expect more of this over the next period of time [...] There will be people who will try to disrupt the process," as quoted by the BBC.He commented that he believed the incident was a "one-off" occurrence, and said he tried to reassure concerned locals in the area.Police said IRA dissidents held a Belfast taxi driver at gunpoint in his home and used his vehicle to carry the bomb to the rear of Palace Barracks. Witnesses report hearing an explosion shortly after midnight local time; Al Jazeera puts the precise time of the detonation at 00.24 local time (23.24 UTC). One man was hospitalised following the bombing, although there are no reports of deaths.According to a local journalist, security has cordoned off the area near the explosion.A car bomb that exploded at about 20:00 MDT Thursday (01:00 Friday UTC) in a violent area of Ciudad Juárez, Mexico killed several people and injured more.Police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said Friday that Mexican federal police received a call that an officer was dead. Seguro went on to say, "When they went to check the car, there was a dead body in there, dressed up like a police officer, but it wasn't one of ours. They put him in a civilian car but dressed him up in a municipal police uniform. That's when the bomb went off. It's like an act of terrorism."Federal police spokesman Ramon Salinas said the blast killed two officers, a paramedic, and one civilian, although Mayor Jose Reyes said that only three died. At least six others were injured, although reports have said the total injured may be as high as sixteen. Four remain in the hospital, including three paramedics and one civilian.Mexican authorities say it was a car bomb, but counter-terrorism experts are still unsure as to what caused the vehicle to explode. Intelligence expert Fred Burton said, "For this to be an improvised grenade attack, in some capacity, it doesn't surprise me."The Juarez cartel, one of the two drug-traffickers in the area, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a graffiti message. "We have more car bombs," the graffiti said.Ciudad Juárez has a history for trafficking drugs to the United States, especially into Texas.Before the explosion, the police arrested a suspected leader of the Juarez cartel, Jesus Armando Acosta Guerrero.This year more than 7,000 people have died as a result of drug-related violence in Mexico since this year began. Attorney General Arturo Chavez on Friday said nearly 25,000 people have died in the last three and a half year period.A car bomb detonated Wednesday outside of Zahedan, the capital of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan Province. The bomb killed 11 Revolutionary Guard members and injured 34 others.Jundallah, a Sunni millitant group suspected of having ties with al-Qaida, took responsibility for the attack. Officials have yet to confirm their claim. Zahedan deputy Hossein Ali Shahriyari blamed Pakistan, calling it a "safe haven for insurgents".Police reports say that a car bomb containing nearly 50kg of explosives, has detonated in the Pakistani city of Peshawar on Saturday, killing at least 11 people and injuring at least 30 others. The bomb exploded at a busy road in the Kashkal area. According to police, a school bus was passing at the time of the detonation which resulted in many of the deaths being children.Around seventeen cars were damaged by the explosion, five of them catching fire."We received nine dead bodies. Two more people expired later. The condition of two people among the 31 injured is serious," Doctor Hameed Afridi told the Agence France-Presse news agency from the main Peshawar hospital. According to a list of victims that was signed by Afridi, five men, four children aged eight to seventeen years old, and two women were among the casualties."We were sitting in our showroom when there was a huge blast," said Mohammad Anis, the owner of a car showroom located near where the incident took place. "When I came out, I saw fire and smoke everywhere around me."No one or group has claimed responsibility for the blast.According to police, at least three civilians were killed and three others injured by a car bomb in the Republic of Dagestan in Russia.Reports say the blast occurred outside the Karavan Cafe in Khasavyurt and only killed those inside the cafe.An unconfirmed report says one of the injured died while receiving medical treatment.There are nearly daily attacks in Dagestan from Islamic militants, wanting to form an Islamic state. The militants usually target police and other security officials.Militants from Dagestan are suspected in an attack earlier this week at the Domodedovo airport in Moscow, killing at least 35 and injuring 110.In the city of Grozny in Chechnya, a car bomb may have killed a 10-12 year old boy and/or a 20 year old man and a woman (sources differ). The explosion wounded two other people.  Grozny is the capital of Chechnya, where rebels have been waging a campaign for independence from Russia.At least 132 people were killed on Sunday after two car bombings struck the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. Over 500 were hurt in the attacks, which were the worst to strike the country in over two years.The attacks occurred at the Justice Ministry building and a provincial government office close to the high-security Green Zone part of the city. The explosions came during rush hour, at 10.30 local time (07.30 UTC).Officials have warned that the death toll is likely to rise, as rescue workers are still searching underneath the rubble of collapsed buildings to find more bodies.Sources gave conflicting reports as to whether suicide bombers were involved in the attacks, or whether the bombs had been detonated remotely. According to the police, cars loaded with explosives had been parked in garages close to the targeted buildings.So many people were wounded in the blasts that private cars helped ambulances transport bodies to local hospitals. Rescue efforts were hindered by the heavy rush hour traffic. The buildings targeted by the bombings caught fire, and officials had to close down roads nearby as fire trucks tried to quell the flames.Yasmeen Afdhal, 24, who works for the Baghdad provincial administration, was a witness to one of the bombings. He described his experiences: "the walls collapsed and we had to run out. There are many wounded, and I saw them being taken away. They were pulling victims out of the rubble, and rushing them to ambulances."Iraqi council member Mohammed al-Rubaiey said that about 25 staff members of the Baghdad Provincial Council, which runs the country's capital, died in the bombings.Hamid Saadi, the owner of a shop near the blast, told the news agency Reuters that the explosion caused significant destruction. "The explosion destroyed everything [...] it's like it was an earthquake, nothing is still in its place," he said.A reporter for the BBC said that the force of the blast was so strong that it could be felt for several miles away.Prime Minister Nouri Maliki accused al-Qaeda of being behind the bombings. "These cowardly terrorist attacks must not affect the determination of the Iraqi people to continue their struggle against the remnants of the dismantled regime and al-Qaeda terrorists, who committed a brutal crime against civilians," he said in a statement.

According to the National Park Service, the plane crashed into the southern slope of Mount Healy, and the crash was just 200 yards away from Denali's only road. Though it is estimated that three people died in the crash, it has been hard to determine exactly how many died as "the plane pretty much disintegrated," park spokeswoman Kris Fister said. The explosion from the crash sparked a small wildfire that firefighters contained within two acres (one hectare.)Though George Clare, a man from Las Vegas who witnessed the crash, thought the plane looked like a military aircraft, US military officials have stated that none of their planes were involved. Clare has said that the plane was "... a military khaki green kind of color. It was propeller-driven. It was a fixed wing aircraft and it had kind of a flat underbelly."  The Federal Aviation Administration, which tracks civil flying accidents, later circulated a report that identified the aircraft as a Fairchild C-123K, and echoed the initial reports that all three on board died, including one passenger.Jeff Kowalczyk, an EMT hiking through the 6,075,107 acre park with his wife, a nurse, said that he saw the plane positioned almost upside-down as it crashed.

Of the two tunnels, only the South tunnel has been reopened to the trains that run the route, the blaze having seriously damaged the North tunnel.The fire started on a freight train loaded with lorries. It burned for 16 hours and at its hottest was at 1,000°C. 27 lorries, six freight cars and a locomotive have been damaged. Significantly, the damage to the tunnel itself runs along a 700m stretch and exceeds the damage caused by an earlier fire last decade. The other fire required £200 million and a six month closure before the tunnel could be reopened.The incident required 32 people, mainly lorry drivers, to be evacuated from the train, which was heading to Calais. Fourteen were taken to hospital, some suffering from smoke inhalation. Several of those who escaped have said that they had expected to die. The fire's cause is unclear. The Guardian reports the fire started on board a vehicle carrying chemicals, but the BBC reports that the origin is unknown. Both sources confirm a lorry carrying carbolic acid was on board and French authorities say it is overturned near the seat of the fire, but it is unclear if this is the lorry the Guardian meant.Eurostar are operating some passenger trains through the tunnel, and limited freight services have also resumed, but long delays are expected. Car trains have not yet resumed.Conservative transport spokesman Timothy Kirkhope commented that he felt the fire was worrying, saying "[w]hile thankfully nobody was killed in this incident, two significant fires in 11 years should act as a wake-up call."However, operator Eurotunnel, who run regular evacuation drills, was pleased with the response by its staff.French authorities are investigating the accident as it occurred at the French side, seven miles from the French exit of the 32-mile tunnel.Thirty-four people had to be evacuated this lunchtime after a fire started on a lorry, which was being transported on a freight train in the Channel Tunnel.Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, said all services had to be suspended this afternoon due to the small blaze in which nobody was hurt.John Keefe, a spokesman for Eurotunnel, said: "It was a freight shuttle going through with about 34 people on board, who have all been evacuated safely."Eurotunnel is conducting checks of the tunnel and its equipment. Once these investigations are completed, Eurotunnel will commence a progressive restart of commercial services." The company also said services through the Tunnel would hopefully resume later today. "Unfortunately with this being a very busy time of year, it's going to take a few hours to clear the backlog once we've got started again," said Mr Keefe. A Eurostar spokesman said: "We are advising passengers to avoid travelling today if possible. Tickets can be exchanged for another day." The Channel Tunnel is a 31 mile long rail tunnel beneath the English Channel which connects Folkestone in Kent to Coquelles near Calais in northern France.An expedition guide working for the BBC has died after he was charged by an elephant in Tanzania on Friday.

"These people are extremely fragile," said state Rep. Ted Speliotis, D-Danvers, whose district includes the affected area. "Many of them have Alzheimer's and other illnesses. It's clear they can't stay here long, but it's clear they won't be able to return for quite a while."Danvers Fire Chief James P. Tutko toured the area by helicopter and said many residents would be kept from their homes for the foreseeable future. "It looks like a war zone, that's the only thing I can say," Tutko said. When asked about the loss of no life at all, he responded "Somebody out there likes us." Finally, he said that finding out the cause of the explosion would take days.Outgoing governor Mitt Romney toured the area and said the explosion was a "Thanksgiving miracle" as the explosion was "equivalent to a 2,000 lb bomb going off in a residential neighborhood," and that no one was killed and only about 10 people suffered only minor injuries in area that included over 300 residents. Residents of the area have been evacuated to the Danvers High School where temporary shelter has been set up by the American Red Cross of Massachusetts Bay. Donations are being taken for residents affected by the explosion. Residents are also being told to start filing insurance claims right away and to keep track of their expenses for items bought.There were minor environmental concerns due to water runoff of chemicals. According the Environmental Protection Agency's on-scene coordinator Mike Nalipinski, preliminary tests showed low levels of toluene, a solvent, but said it was nothing of significance. Water runoff from the water used by firefighters left a purple sheen on the river and tests were being conducted. However, the water is not a local drinking water supply and the chemical evaporates quickly. Chief Tutko said there was no risk of toxic fumes getting into the air.An Eastern Propane facility was also located near the area, however, it was not the source of the explosion. A spokesman for the company said that although the property suffered some minor damage, their tanks are secure.According to WHDH television, a person who answered the telephone at CAI's Georgetown, Massachusetts headquarters refused comment, and a telephone message left at the company president's home was not immediately returned.Six children aged between 3 and 14 died early Sunday in an apartment fire on the 7700 block of Marshfield Ave on the north side of Chicago, IL.

Xinhua News Agency also reported that a 21-month-old boy died Monday of the virus in Hubei province. After an order was given last week by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China that all cases must be reported, the count of those infected has increased markedly. Eastern China saw a large number of cases in early March, but this information was not made public until late April. In March, Children under age six in eastern Anhui province began being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the virus, and the outbreak spread quickly after that. The city of Fuyang in Anhui province was especially hard-hit by the outbreak. "The majority of patients who were in critical condition have recovered," said a Health Ministry official in a statement on Monday. As of Monday, 3,606 HFMD infections had been reported in Beijing. Deaths have occurred in the provinces of Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Beijing and Hubei."What I know is the death rate has gone down drastically since early May. There are very, very few cases with complications — 99 percent of these are mild cases," said World Health Organization (WHO) China representative Hans Troedsson in a statement on Wednesday. Incidents of the disease are expected to peak in June and July.Children with mild cases of the disease generally recover rapidly after manifesting a rash and a fever. Other symptoms include diarrhea, cold-like symptoms, and sores on the extremities and mouth. In severe cases, fluid may accumulate in the brain, and result in meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary edema, paralysis and death. The EV-71 virus is spread through contact with fluid secreted from blisters, nose and throat mucus, feces and saliva. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for the virus. The disease is unrelated to foot-and-mouth disease, which affects livestock.United States Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt was visiting in the country, and said in a statement Monday in Shanghai that the U.S. is assisting China fight the outbreak. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, symptomatic treatment can be given to address possible fever and aches and pains. The CDC advises children and adults to practice proper hand washing technique, and to wash and disinfect contaminated items and surfaces using diluted solution of chlorine-containing bleach.China is also dealing with a magnitude-7.9 earthquake which hit the country Monday and has killed almost 15,000. The outbreak is a concern to the government, as the country prepares for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing this August. "We are confident the potential outbreak will not affect the Beijing Olympic Games," China's Health Ministry spokesman Mao Qunan stated. And at a joint press conference held by China's Ministry of Health and the WHO, he further noted that, "China is confident that it can control the spread of the disease with effective prevention methods."Servicio Hidrográfico y Oceanográfico de la Armada de Chile (SHOA, Spanish for Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy) released a report last Tuesday amidst public criticism of its response to the tsunami that hit the coast of Chile on February 27. The agency recognized the difficulty of arriving at every member of its Maritime and Naval networks. It reported that the tsunami warning was activated at 03:51 local time (06:51 UTC), 17 minutes after the earthquake, due to the delay of an ONEMI operator, whose identity "was not possible to determine"; the operator sent the alert via fax. The warning was ended at 04:56 local time (07:56 UTC) by SHOA director Mariano Rojas, who has since been dismissed.Despite the late tsunami warning, the Army said that it was an "adequate time for emergencies of this nature, considering the time required to obtain the information on the epicentre and magnitude."The tsunami arrived at the following times, as the Army reported:Pichilemu: 03:48 (06:48 UTC); 04:15 (07:15 UTC).Constitución: 03:49 (06:49 UTC); 04:17 (07:17 UTC); 04:50 (07:50 UTC); 05:20 (08:20 UTC).San Antonio: 03:50 (06:50 UTC); 04:20 (07:20 UTC).Talcahuano and Dichato: 03:54 (07:54 UTC); 05:30 (08:30 UTC): 06:00 (09:00 UTC); 06:40 (09:40 UTC).Juan Fernández Islands: 04:25 (07:25 UTC); 04:40 (07:40 UTC).Valparaíso: 04:51 (07:51 UTC); 04:50 (07:50 UTC); 05:20 (08:20 UTC): 05:40 (08:40 UTC).The Chilean Army acknowledges 65 recruits are missing in the Andes from a training exercise that was hit by severe snow storm. Colonel Carlos Mezano also reports 5 bodies have been recovered so far, apparently all had died from hypothermia.433 Soldiers of the Regiment "Los Ángeles" went missing Thursday on the Los Barros range in southern central Chile, close to Argentine border, approximately 600 km southeast of the capital of Santiago. 316 recruits completed the exercise and are reported to be safe. 47 are reported safe, though incommunicado, in a high mountain refuge. The remaining 65 are still missing.General Juan Emilio Cheyre, Chief Commander of the Army declared, "A unit of this type, surprised by a tsunami of snow, is trained to stop, so it is possible that they are all camping [...] I do not want to raise false hopes. This is a unexpected situation, but to me a unit offers more hope than scattered soldiers."Rescue efforts have encountered trouble due to severe bad weather. A 'no fly zone' has been established in the Andes region. The Army and the media are avoiding, for now, speculation over the number of possibly dead soldiers, but the general mood of the families is pessimistic and allegations of neglect by Army officials have started to arise.Most of the soldiers are men from the local area, from 18 to 19 years old. "Chilean troops in 'snow tsunami'" — BBC News, May 20, 2005The recent string of earthquakes in Chile caused widespread damage to buildings. Wikinews reporter Diego Grez is on-scene and in his second photoessay, he shows us the impact of the earthquake in the O'Higgins Region and takes a look at how people living in the area have reacted to the devastation.On the Feb. 27, Chile was hit by an magnitude  8.8 earthquake; almost 500 were killed, with resulting tsunami destroying most coastal towns between Llolleo and Araucanía Region. A second earthquake last week, with its epicentre in Pichilemu, caused destruction in the Coquimbo and Bío Bío regions.A Wikinews contributor is in the area, and we look at the extent of this natural disaster's damage through his photographs.Health Minister of Chile, Jaime Mañalich, announced on Friday the rescue of the 33 Chilean miners trapped in San José Mine, Copiapó is to begin this Tuesday, October 12.Mining Minister Laurence Golborne announced that the tunnel the miners will ascend "will be ready in the next 24 hours. [The tunnel] could be done by this night or tomorrow's early morning." However, he couldn't "assure an hour because it is not exact.""The rescue will take place between three and eight days (after finishing the perforation), depending on the decisions that are taken about the encamisado (process of coating the tunnel with a metal pipe)," Golborne added. He also said the miners "have no anxiety," saying that "they've waited a few months now for their rescue and are aware that they will have to wait some more days."The thirty-three miners have been trapped at the bottom of San José Mine, Copiapó, Atacama Region, Chile since August 5. It was discovered they were alive on August 22, when they sent the note "We are fine in the shelter the 33 [of us]."A gold mine collapse in Copiapó, Atacama Region, Chile has trapped 33 miners since last Thursday. Another collapse occurred on Saturday, that provoked temporary suspension of the rescue works.Rescue efforts were first focused on a ventilation shaft, but attempts to reach the miners failed. Rescuers have been drilling into the mine since Sunday. "The situation is very complex, the mine continues to have collapses because there is a geological fault-line," said Sebastián Piñera, President of Chile, who "pledged to do everything possible to get to the trapped miners," but acknowledged he was pessimistic.There is no certainty that the miners, who are trapped about 400 meters (1300 feet) below the ground, are still alive.The opposition to the Chilean President Sebastián Piñera have criticized his management after the earthquake. Piñera however gave a stability message to the Chilean people last Wednesday. On Thursday morning, he announced that he would discontinue the "catastrophe state" declared in the most affected regions by the earthquake: O'Higgins, Maule and Bío Bío. He also emphasized the actions he has taken during the twenty days he has been as President.Piñera also said that the decree that declares as affected zones the Valparaíso, Santiago Metropolitan, O'Higgins, Maule, Bío Bío and Araucanía regions will be kept in order to ease the aid plans, and military forces will stay in these areas."We've decided to keep the Armed Forces on the affected areas with a double purpose: they can still collaborate in aid humanitarian works with the enormous job to reconstruct what the earthquake and tsunami destroyed," said Piñera. "We want to halt the delinquency, as we did last March 29 in the Day of the Combatant Young [Día del Joven Combatiente]," he added.He also said he was satisfied with the promulgation of the "bono marzo" ("March bonus", a bonus of money that poor people will receive), one of his symbolic proposals for his government.China Airlines Flight 120, a Boeing 737 800, burst into flames at Naha Airport in Okinawa, Japan shortly after touchdown, with 157 passengers and 8 crew aboard. All passengers and crew have been accounted for; there were no casualties.The plane was on the ground when the fire broke out and some reports say that all the passengers and crew made it off the plane safely. The pilots were seen jumping from the cockpit seconds before an explosion ripped through the plane. The plane was flying from Taoyuan, the county of Taiwan, and its final destination was Naha, the capital of Okinawa.Initial reports from ground personnel suggest that a fuel leak in the right engine could have started a series of explosions. Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire by using foam.After an oil pipeline in China exploded and spilled around 1,500 tonnes of oil into the Yellow Sea near the city of Dalian, the government has launched a cleanup operation consisting of more than 800 vessels.The spill occurred on Friday, after a pipeline at the port exploded. The oil terminal at the port has been closed ever since.  Authorities have been using 24 ships designed for cleaning up oil, and today ordered around 800 civilian fishing boats to join the operation.The spill has been halted, although an oil slick which measured 50 square kilometers at its height remains in the harbor, and ships are using absorbent foam to remove oil from the water, as well as barriers to keep oil from reaching the shore. Despite their efforts, parts of the coast reportedly have a slick of oil evident on beaches and rocks.Although rough seas have affected the cleanup, authorities expect to have completed the operations within ten days.According to domestic media, concerns over safety at the port have been raised in the past; a government study in 2006 noted that five projects at the port were at risk of accidents.The spill has caused ongoing disruptions to the port's operations, with several ships, including six oil tankers carrying a total of around twelve million barrels of oil, having been diverted to other ports both in China and other countries.At least 91 people have now been confirmed dead in Friday's disaster, in which a wall of water and debris smashed into the school near Ning'an, in the northern Heilongjiang province. Hundreds of children and more than 30 teachers of the school, were inside at the time.Of the dead, reports from the Xinhua news agency say that 87 were students and four were adults. The reports also indicate that two dozen people are still in a criticial condition in hospital.The flooding itself, triggered by heavy rain caused damage in several cities near Ning'an city, knocking down up to 55 houses.A Chinese official says harsh winter weather is threatening food production and adding to inflationary pressures. Political pressure is also building on the government for its failure to anticipate and solve the problems. A top Chinese disaster relief official was quoted by Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper Thursday as calling it the worst natural disaster since the People's Republic was founded in 1949.Tens of millions of Chinese have been affected by the snowstorms across the central and southern parts of the country. Hundreds of thousands are camping out in train stations, hoping the snowed-in trains will start running again to take them home for the lunar new year holiday.  An unknown number of people are stranded on icy highways, cut off from adequate heat and food.The situation is so serious that Premier Wen Jiabao has personally visited train stations in Hunan and Guangdong provinces in the past couple of days. He is telling stranded workers the government is trying to get transportation moving so they can get home for the holiday. But other officials have advised migrant workers to forget about going home, and stay in their places of work.Officials say unusually low temperatures and heavy snowfalls have destroyed crops and greenhouses, and are severely affecting winter food production. Chen Xiwen is the deputy director of the Communist Party's leading financial team. Chen says the impact of the disaster in southern China on winter crop production is extremely serious. He says the impact on fresh vegetables and fruit has been catastrophic in some places.Prices for fresh fruit and vegetables have doubled in some of the worst-hit areas.  The situation is exacerbating the rise in food prices that began last year. China's consumer price index rose nearly 5 percent for all of 2007, and was up 6.5 percent in December alone. A major part of the increase was in food prices.  Chen, however, says he does not expect inflation this month to get worse, despite the crop damage being caused by the snow.  Chen says winter grain and edible oils are grown mainly in the north, which is outside the storms' reach, and winter wheat production will not be seriously affected.  Two weeks of ice and snowstorms have killed more than 60 people and caused more than three billion dollars in direct damage.China's top weather expert told state media Thursday the storms will last well into the new year holiday, which begins February 6. The lunar new year is China's most important holiday.  Normally, tens of millions of people would be heading home at this time.The Chinese government has said that severe seasonal flooding in the country has displaced over a million people and killed at least 155.According to the Office of Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, the southeastern parts of China were hit the worst. 1.3 million people were forced to temporary shelters after 140,000 homes collapsed, mostly in the provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi.The office reports that direct economic losses from the disaster has reached 24 billion yuan, or about US$6.5 billion, and that the figure is 370% higher than the damage caused by last year's seasonal rains.The rainy season in eastern China is in June through August; flooding is frequent, and causes mudslides and deaths. This year, however, rainfall totals appear to be the highest they have been in over ten years.A large scale environmental accident is causing wide-spread disruptions to water supplies in Harbin, China after an accidental release of toxins two weeks ago at a chemical plant. Water supplies are being shipped in amidst a relative calm, Thursday. Local officials have suggested normal water supplies may resume in some form as early as Sunday.An explosion at a workshop of the No. 101 Chemical Plant of the Jilin Petrochemical Company in Jilin City on November 13 resulted in the accidental release of benzene and benzene-like organic compounds, including nitrobenzene, into the Songhua River. The upstream position of the plant relative to the Chinese city of Harbin made the pollution a risk to the health of its populace; the solution of ceasing public water production will leave more than 3.8 million people without public drinking water for three or more days. Harbin, the capital of the neighboring Heilongjiang province, is located about 380km (230 miles) from the plant and is itself located near the middle of the 1,897 km long Songhua River–from which it derives the majority of its water supplies. Benzene is a carcinogen, and the levels initially released into the Songhua River were 108 times the national safety levels for the country. By November 21, the polluted area included roughly 80 kilometers of the Songhua River.The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) as well as local experts and officials have worked on a pollution-control campaign and emergency schemes have been launched by the two provincial governments to limit the effects of the environmental incidents. Jilin also quickly acted to block the further entry of the pollutants into the river and released large volumes of water from a reservoir in order to dilute them; at this time, Harbin added active carbon powders in quantities reaching 1,400 tons and more in order to purify the water. The densities of the benzene and nitrobenzene substances in the river near Jilin have dropped to levels within the state safety guidelines since the accidental release. The water that will pass through Harbin is expected to contain only small amounts of the toxic pollutants and to pass through Friday morning based upon its current speed. In preparation for the passage of these pollutants, the municipal government of Harbin has established an emergency medical care system composed of 15 hospitals to treat residents that may be exposed to contamination.Zhang Dingbang, deputy secretary of the municipal government, said, at the first press conference since the incident  that was held Wednesday, that Harbin is drilling 100 new wells in order to obtain 80,000 tons of underground water in addition to its current output from 918 wells of 320,000 tons every day. Nevertheless, thousand of tons of purified water have been provided by neighboring regions and enterprise donations, which will further increase this supply. Harbin residents have collected more than 300,000 tons of water as of Tuesday.  Liu Yuzhu, a senior official with the municipal water supply and drainage corporation, has said that this supply is expected to provide for the daily average use of 18,600 tons per day for the three days required for the clear passage of the pollutants through the area.Officials say the death toll in the recent earthquake in China has reached almost 15,000. The news comes as 2,000 of the nation's troops were dispatched to the Zipingku Dam to repair "extremely dangerous" cracks in the structure, which is upriver from Dujiangyan City, already severely hit by the disaster.It is feared the toll will rise much further as 60,000 people are missing after the 7.9 magnitude quake in Sichuan left entire towns "razed to the ground" with no buildings standing, according to officials in the area. At one destroyed school 178 children were found dead after the building collapsed while they slept inside it. A second school at Wudu, twenty miles from the epicentre behind the White Cloud Mountain, has 130 dead children and 150 more still buried and feared dead.Zipingku Dam has had some water drained to ease the pressure on it. According to the Ministry of Water Resources' website "If Zipingpu develops a serious safety problem, it could bring disaster to Dujiangyan city downstream." Numerous other dams are also affected, including several others near Dujiangyan. In addition, experts from France's Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety say it cannot yet be ruled out that a number of nuclear power facilities in the area have been affected.50,000 troops have been brought to the area to provide assistance. However, emergency response is being made difficult by continuing poor weather and landslides that have cut off Wenchuan county. In Mianyang alone, one of the worst-hit cities, some 19,000 people are thought to be buried under rubble and the first rescuers to reach the epicenter state tens of thousands may be dead there as well. The Wenchuan town of Yingxiu has only 2,300 confirmed survivors from a 12,000-strong population. Some aid in the form of food, water and medicine has arrived by helicopter, but rotorcraft operations are very dangerous due to ongoing poor weather. Trucks loaded with noodles and biscuits were raided by crowds before the aid could be properly handed out. The People's Liberation Army intends to send in paratroopers.“They had better set up a distribution system, or we will be stealing what we can,” one survivor promised.Meanwhile, accusations of blame over the scale of the effects have been leveled at construction companies and local authorities. The allegations say that the firms used substandard techniques and materials when building many projects, and corrupt local authorities deliberately ignored the problem. Some people have nicknamed the resulting structures "tofu buildings", an allusion to the fact that they are alleged to be 'as soft as tofu'. "It's nothing but corruption - they must have used sub-standard cement and steel," said rescuer Dr Tian, who withheld his second name from journalists. It is also alleged that both local residents and international scientific organisations were ignored when they warned of a large impending earthquake.As a mark of respect, the Olympic torch relay will be scaled back in response to the earthquake.Two year old Wang Yue from Guangdong, China — who was hit and run by two van drivers, then disregarded by eighteen passers-by — has died. Video footage caught by a CCTV camera last week shows the onlookers pass her whilst she lay cataleptic and bleeding in a busy market in Foshan. In the end Wang was rescued by a 58 year old rubbish collector, who has been proclaimed a hero after he moved her to the side of the street and got help.The incident resulted in a worldwide outcry questioning the ethics of the Chinese people. The local government is now looking to bring in a law to make it obligatory for members of the public to assist those in anguish.Police detained a nine-year-old after a blaze started in a wholesale market in Huizhou, Guangdong, southern China on Thursday afternoon. Seventeen died.According to police the child was playing with matches in a warehouse on the top-floor of the four-storey Yiwu Commodity Mall. Soon the entire floor was engulfed, leading to an eighteen-hour rescue mission involving 270 firefighters with 45 vehicles. Nine market managers have also been detained.The complex includes restaurants and a cinema. The cinema's bathroom, on the top floor, became a trap for ten of the victims. Firefighter Wan Jie told reporters "Our firemen tried several times to approach the fourth floor where the cinema was located, without success. It was too dark to see anything and the temperature was extremely high. We carried oxygen bottles as we crawled forward." He described how he and another firefighter almost ran out of oxygen while rescuing one girl. Around 300 people were evacuated. Photos at the scene showed medical personnel, some with stretchers, waiting en masse to treat casualties.Firefighters came from Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Shanwei to augment local forces. Four, including Wan Jie, were injured. "It was the worst and most dangerous fire I have ever attended," he said. The fire service said the entire building, which passed a safety inspection last month, was at risk of collapse. The fire was extinguished around 8a.m. local time yesterday.Southern Metropolis News released a list of suspected victims. Among them are a family of four and a fourteen-year-old girl from Hong Kong.Fuxin city (阜新市; pinyin: Fùxīn shì) – An underground explosion in a mine in China's northeastern Liaoning Province has left over 200 miners dead.Current figures say 203 miners were killed, and another 22 were injured with 13 miners still missing. The blast occurred at 3:49pm local time on Monday afternoon. The explosion, 242m underground, is believed to have been caused by gas igniting. This morning a rescue team arrived at the site in Fuxin to attempt locate survivors and treat injured.China has a history of major mining accidents. Last November, 166 miners died in an explosion in mine in Chenjiashan mine in Shaanxi province. In 2004, a official figures show that 5,000 workers died in accidents in mines, 35% of the world-wide death toll in coal mines.The government of China announced it would begin three days of mourning on Monday, as the death toll from the 7.9 magnitude earthquake centered in the Sichuan province has been raised to nearly 32,500, with 220,000 injured. At 2:28 p.m local time, flags will be moved to half mast for three days, there will be three minutes of silence, and entertainment in public will be suspended for the mourning period.Authorities have continued to pull victims out of the rubble resulting from the quake, 65 since the original quake, with two pulled out alive more than six days after the earthquake. Rescuers are also trying to pull out two still alive. More than 9,500 people are still trapped under rubble throughout the province.Chinese authorities are worried as aftershocks continue to affect the region devastated by the initial earthquake, while water builds up in clogged rivers. An 5.8 magnitude aftershock shook buildings and caused people to evacuate in Chengdu, 200 km (125 miles) south of the aftershock's epicenter. The aftershock killed three people and injured 1,000 others. A buildup of water is occurring 3 km (2 miles) upstream of Beichuan, where a man was freed from under a hospital's remains.Chinese President Hu Jintao said to families of victims in Yinghua that "We will make every effort to save our people even if there is only the slightest hope and possibility." They are preventing people from going into the affected region for fear of these conditions. Families of possible victims who tried to enter the affected region were not allowed into the area by police, due to fears of aftershocks and the clogged rivers.60 aid organizations from 13 countries have assisted so far with the earthquake, including Japan, Russia, Taiwan, South Korea, the United States and Singapore, and in addition to aid from inside China there has been 6 billion yuan (858 million United States dollars) of aid.A Chinese merchant ship has run aground off the coast of Australia and began leaking oil into the ocean near the Great Barrier Reef, triggering fears of a major oil spill into the waters near the reef.The ship, the Shen Neng 1, was carrying 950 tonnes of oil, along with 65,000 tonnes of coal, from Gladstone, a port in Queensland, Australia, to China. It reportedly ran aground sometime late on Saturday 70 kilometers from Great Keppel Island, according to a spokesperson from the Queensland state government. The spokesperson, Mark Strong, said that oil had been spotted off the ship about two nautical miles away, although there was currently no major leak. A plane was dispatched to spray a dispersant over the oil, as well as to assess the situation, and a major clean-up operation was being planned by authorities.The day after the ship first grounded, reports began emerging that it had been travelling in a restricted zone of the ocean, around nine miles outside the normal shipping lane, and had been travelling at full speed when it grounded. An official from Queensland said that a probing inquiry would later be conducted into its presence outside the shipping channel.Conservationists said that the incident was "a sign of things to come," and that there was the potential for a much larger accident in the future. One such person, a spokesman for the Capricorn Conservation Council, said that "We are outraged that no marine pilot is required on ships between Gladstone and Cairns." Cairns is a city on the northern coast of Australia.A tanker truck filled with 35 tons of liquid chlorine collided with another truck and crashed in China's Jiangsu province on Wednesday, leaking its load, killing at least 28 and injuring hundreds. 10,000 villagers have been evacuated from the surrounding area along the Beijing-Shanghai expressway.The driver left the scene of the accident in Huai'an city, but later in the day turned himself over to authorities in Nanjing, the provincial capital. The driver of the other truck died on the scene.Vice mayor Lu Changsu told China's Xinhua that the death toll may increase because three patients are still in critical condition. Lu said that 350 people remain hospitalized.A cleanup crew is treating the accident site with a caustic soda. Area farmers are concerned that local farmland will be rendered infertile by the spill.CPC Vice Premier Huang Ju asked the provincial Jiangsu government to "spare no efforts", according to Xinhua.The Buffalo Fire Department and Police were called to a hazmat situation at Canisius College on Main Street after security reported that a one gallon glass container containing chloroform broke, spilling about a pint onto the floor of the college's science building.According to communications by firefighters, who arrived at around 8:20 a.m. (eastern time), the glass container spilled on the third floor in room 318. As a precaution the building was evacuated and East Delevan road between Main Street and Jefferson Avenues was closed to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic while crews worked to clean up the spill.At about 9:15 hazmat crews entered the room and began to clean up the chemical "using kitty litter" and fans to air out the room. They then sealed the material in a five gallon container. At 9:23 a.m. firefighters stated that they no longer detected the chemical in the air and began to pack up their gear.Officials for the college assessed the situation and decided to keep the building closed for the day. "At 8:22am this morning the Public Safety Department and Buffalo Fire Department responded to a report of a chemical spill on the third floor of the Health Science Center. As the building is cleaned, the Health Science Building will remain closed today and reopen tomorrow morning," a college official said to Wikinews, adding they could not confirm the firefighter reports.Firefighters believe the container containing the chemical was knocked over while someone working with maintenance was cleaning the floors.There are no reports of injuries, but WKBW reports that the maintenance worker was taken to Sister's of Saint Mercy's hospital not far from the college for observation.Chloroform is a common solvent used in chemistry laboratories.  Minimal exposure can cause dizziness, headaches and fainting while prolonged exposure can cause liver and kidney damage. It is considered a hazardous material and environmentally unsafe. Banned as a consumer product since 1976 in the U.S., it was previously used in toothpaste, cough medicines and pharmaceuticals.On Monday, a helicopter accidentally dropped a concrete block weighing nearly 1,500 pounds when it was flying it up to an Austrian mountain for a "ski resort construction project". The concrete block struck a cable holding a gondola, the one that suffered all of the casualties, although other gondolas reported people suffering injuries from the jolt. The car that was hit fell quite some distance to the ground, up to hundreds of meters. Two more cars started tilting as some people were flung out from these cars.  A least nine people are reported to be killed in the incidents. There are also many injured, some of them seriously.  Up to a dozen rescue helicopters immediately rushed to the scene from all over the Swiss alps.The work was made to make the infrastructure more secure after an incident that happened when a low-flying US marine plane cut through a cable killing 20 people in 1998.  This incident will bring into question if those policies saved lives or need to be recast in light of this tragedy.A collision between Christian band MercyMe's tour bus and a car has killed two passengers in the car and the 18-year-old driver's unborn baby. The woman is in critical condition following the crash, which occurred in Fort Wayne, northeastern Indiana.The bus was headed to Six Flags St. Louis in Missouri for the band to play to a sold-out crowd. At 1:15 a.m. Saturday, according to witnesses, the bus was going through a green light when the car made a turn in front of it.No-one on the bus was injured, and the band rescheduled the show for September as a result of the incident. A photograph of the damaged bus was posted on the band's website, depicting moderate crumpling to the front area of the vehicle.A 1987 Dodge Ram Wagon van registered to the Tabernacle of Deliverance and Prayer flipped over on a highway in southwest Georgia yesterday killing four and injuring fifteen. The van, with nineteen passengers, was heading south on Highway 27 when a tire puncture caused the driver to lose control and crash into the median; it then rolled over several times at about 6:45 local time. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution at the time of the accident the van was overloaded and heading to Florida. The county coroner declined to reveal the age and names of the victims, but it is believed that children were among the passengers and the pastor of the church has been confirmed as one of the fatalities. Two teenagers — a boy of nineteen and a girl of thirteen — are among the dead.Police officers examined the wreckage in situ. The severity of the injuries sustained is unknown, but it is reported that all fifteen survivors were taken to hospital, with some requiring an airlift.A circus elephant managed to escape from her handler on Sunday night in the city of Zurich, Switzerland before being recaptured by local police and circus animal keepers. The 26-year-old female elephant, named Sabu, is from Switzerland's Zirkus Knie. She was able to make her escape just before being put into a trailer, while the keeper was not paying attention.Around 1930 local time (1730 UTC), Sabu was seen wading in Lake Zurich for a short time before walking back onto city streets. Zurich police said that Sabu wandered along the Bahnhofstrasse avenue of Zurich, which is known as the city's most exclusive shopping street. She also passed by Zürich Hauptbahnhof (the city's main rail station) and Paradeplatz, a square of Bahnhofstrasse, where both Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG have headquarters.For nearly an hour, police chased the elephant around the city before she was finally peacefully recaptured in the Talstrasse section of Zurich. Circus officials and police followed Sabu, but a circus spokesperson said that she did not respond to their calls. Sabu was also said to have been moving so fast that police had difficulty keeping up with her. At about 2000 local time (1900 UTC), a keeper was able to control the animal and load her onto a truck to take her to Winterthur, where the other circus animals were. There were no reports of any damage or injuries during the incident, and although police held back onlookers, at least one bystander managed to capture video of the event.The circus said that Sabu may have escaped after being frightened by storms near Zurich. After returning to the circus, she was said to be tired, but "pleased to be back."Two weeks after a 19th century stable and livery on Jersey Street partially collapsed and caused 15 homes to be evacuated in Buffalo, New York, residents still do not have answers from the city despite a court order to work with them and come to an agreement on a way to save some or all of the building, Wikinews has learned. Despite the frustration from residents, the city is planning on suing the building's owner. A rally was held at the stable's site where residents are hoping to bring more awareness to the situation and gain more support to save the building.On June 11, a significant portion of the stable's right side wall collapsed into the yard of a resident's home. Authorities, including the Buffalo Fire Department were called to the scene to evaluate the collapse and evacuate 15 homes of residents surrounding the stable as a precautionary measure. The following day, the city ordered an emergency demolition on the building, which was stopped by a restraining order residents with Save The Livery (www.savethelivery.com) won on June 14. Two weeks later, five homes are still evacuated and residents don't know when they will be able to return.On June 19, Judge Justice Christopher Burns of the New York State Supreme Court ordered a halt to the emergency demolition and ordered the city and residents to come to an agreement to save the building, or at least a significant portion of it. Despite a court date today, no agreement has yet been reached between the two parties."It is in the interest of the city to have a safe environment--but also important to maintain a sense of historical preservation," stated Burns in his June 19th ruling. The court ruled that a limited demolition could take place and that the city was only allowed to remove material in immediate danger to residents and pedestrians, but stated that the demolition could only be performed with "hand tools." The court also ordered that any rubble which had fallen into neighboring yards when the building collapsed, to be removed. Since then, most of not all the significantly damaged portions of the building or portions in immediate danger of falling have been demolished. The roof has also been removed to put less stress on the stable's walls."Its been over three years since we have been having problems with part of the livery falling down. There was an implosion two weeks ago and suddenly the city wanted to have an emergency demolition," said Catherine Herrick who lives on Summer Street immediately behind the stable and is the main plaintiff in the lawsuit against the city. Many homes on Summer are small cottages which were used as servants quarters when the stable was in operation, many of which were built in the 1820's. At least seven homes on Summer border the stable's back walls. Residents in those homes have significant gardens which have been planted against the building and growing for decades."Both parties are to continue to work together to see how we can meet everybody's needs. This is the third time we have been in that courtroom, and that is what we were basically told to do," added Herrick who said the rally was held today because this "is Buffalo's history. Buffalo is a wonderful place to live because of its history and this is a historical, beautiful building and we need to keep those beautiful buildings."Herrick states that the city is working with residents, but also believes that its "slow moving" and they are allowing the owner to get away with neglect on the property."I believe right now that they are letting the owner get off. The owner was negligent for 20 years, and hasn't done anything to it despite what he has claimed to say. Now that this is an emergency situation, the city has a lot to say about it," added Herrick.Currently the building is owned by Bob Freudenheim who has several building violations against him because its poor condition. He has received at least five violations in three months and residents who live near the building state that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions. Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the Southeast corner of Forest and Elmwood Avenues. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years. Attorneys for Freudenheim confirm that the city is starting proceedings against him for his violations beginning as early as Wednesday June 25. Freudenheim has not released a statement and could not be reached for comment.Many residents want the building preserved and Herrick states that their engineer can have it stable in "four days" as opposed to the 14-30 days it would take to demolish the building and "at a lesser cost than what it costs to demolish it."It will cost the city nearly US$300,000 to demolish the building which is paid for with tax money collected from residents in the city. The Buffalo News reports that fees are approaching $700,000. Though reports say there is a potential buyer of the stable, Wikinews cannot independently confirm those reports.Residents say the stable was designed by Richard A. Waite, a 19th century architect, and was first owned by a company called White Bros., used as a stable and housed at least 30 horses at any given time. It also stored "coaches, coupes, broughams, Victorias  and everything in the line of light livery," stated an article from the West Side Topics dated 1906. According to the article, The company first opened in 1881 on Thirteenth Street, now Normal Avenue, and later moved into the Jersey building in 1892. The Buffalo Fire Department believes the building was built around 1814, while the city property database states it was built in 1870. It is believed to be only one of three stables of this kind still standing in the country.At about 1950, the stable was converted into an automobile body shop and gasoline station.A property record search showed that in 1950 at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which New York State says is used for "below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage." The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, "excavation and backfill," but did not include "the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring." It is not known if the tanks are still on the property, but residents are concerned the city was not taking the precautions to find out.Wikinews has called the city along with the Mayor's office several times, but both have yet to return our calls. There are conflicting reports as to the date of the next hearing. According to Herrick, the next hearing is July 1, 2008 though the Buffalo News states the next hearing is July 8. The News also states that Burns will make a final ruling on the stable at this time.Twenty two civilians, including three children, died, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported, on Saturday after a United States airstrike hit a hospital in the city of Kunduz in northern Afghanistan. Amongst the fatalities were twelve charity staff working for MSF. MSF said there were about two hundred people in the building.A statement was issued on the MSF website criticising the attack and stating "Under the clear presumption that a war crime has been committed, MSF demands that a full and transparent investigation into the event be conducted by an independent international body." The US military released a statement saying they had struck "against individuals threatening the force" and "The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility." The US Government announced there would be three separate investigations, carried out by the Afghan forces, the US military, and NATO. The Afghan interior ministry claimed there had been a Taliban presence in the hospital although this was denied by the insurgent organization.The attack was also condemned by the International Committee of the Red Cross, whilst the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, described the strike as "inexcusable" and called for a full investigation.On September 28, the Taliban launched an assault on Kunduz. The US has been carrying out air strikes to support Afghan government forces attempting to recover the city. MSF said it had often provided the Afghan and US governments with details of the location of the hospital, particularly on September 29. The Taliban had unsuccessfully tried to capture Kunduz in April this year, but they were pushed back by government forces.17 Afghan civilians, including women and children, are thought to be have been killed as the result of U.S. aircraft bombing the village of Chechal in the east of Afghanistan late last week, said a governor.The air strike occurred last Friday in the same area as an elite U.S. military team went missing three days ago. Provincial governor Assadullah Wafa told the Associated Press “seventeen civilians died in the U.S. bombing of the village.” He went on to comment that casualties consisted of women and children, though he did not know the exact figure.A U.S. military statement claimed that the "compound" bombed was a “known operating base for terrorist attacks in Kunar province as well as a base for a medium-level terrorist leader,"The statement, written after criticism in the press of the U.S. military’s lack of precaution in these matters, then went on to say the U.S. armed forces “regret the loss of innocent lives and follow stringent rules of engagement specifically to ensure that non-combatants are safeguarded. However, when enemy forces move their families into the locations where they conduct terrorist operations, they put these innocent civilians at risk."One member of the missing military team has been recovered and is currently being “evaluated” on Monday, a U.S. Defence Department spokesperson said, though he refused to comment on details regarding his whereabouts and health. Afghan and U.S. forces are currently in the Kunar province searching for members of the missing military team. U.S. officials at the time of the bombing said in a statement that the attack utilised “precision-guided munitions that resulted in the deaths of an unknown number of enemy terrorists and non-combatants," The statement continued, concluding that "battle damage assessment is currently ongoing." In May, Afghan president Hamid Karzai voiced his concerns over the excessive number of civilian casualties as a result of US-led operations. Some observers have speculated that the attack on the village was a deliberate response to the downing of a US transport helicopter last month. In that incident, 16 troops died in the worst single blow to American forces since the Taliban was ousted in 2001.Representatives from the British insurance industry have said that the cost of the earthquake which hit Britain early yesterday could be over 10 million GBP. The Association of British Insurers has said in a statement that the cost for the earthquake is "likely to run into the low tens of millions of pounds." The Senior claims manager at the UK bank Norwich Union has described the damage by saying that at the moment most insurance claims regarding the earthquake describe "minor damage such as tiles off roofs, breakages inside the homes and brick walls collapsing." It has also been reported that approximately 1,200 insurance claims were made in the first twelve hours after the earthquake hit Britain.These reports come one day after the United Kingdom was hit by a 5.2 earthquake. Tremors were reported as widespread as Edinburgh, Manchester, Sheffield, Middlesbrough, Cambridge, London, Birmingham and Southampton .According to witness and media reports, at least two hundred people in Nigeria have been killed after pastoralists and villagers clashed near the city of Jos, which has been the source of repeated tension between Christians and Muslims.Local authorities, however, contradicted witness reports, saying that there were eight casualties, as did Mark Lipdo, an aid worker for the Stefanus Foundation charity, who reported that at least a hundred people were dead.Witness reports state that pastoralists started firing into the air in the village of Dogo Nahawa, about five kilometres south of Jos, at night, and attacked those who emerged from their homes. "They came around three o'clock in the morning and they started shooting into the air. The shooting was just meant to bring people from their houses and then when people came out they started cutting them with machetes," commented Peter Jang, who lives in the village, as quoted by Al Jazeera.According to the Agence France-Presse news agency, some of the victims were children.Acting Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said he had placed national troops on "red alert" following the clashes. "The acting president has placed all the security forces in the plateau and neighbouring states on red alert so as to stem any cross-border dimensions to this latest conflict," read a statement released by his office. Armed forces are already present in Jos."The security services are on top of the situation," said Jonathan's spokesman Ima Niboro in an email statement to the Bloomberg news service.In January, at least 400 people were killed and a further four thousand injured in the city of Jos after tensions between Christians and Muslims.Fifteen deaths and over 680 injuries have resulted from clashes between Red shirt protesters and government forces in the Thai capital Bangkok.The deaths of seventeen civilians, including a Japanese cameraman working for the Reuters agency, and four soldiers come after almost a month of protests. Since March 12 Red shirts, so called because of their wearing of red as an identifying symbol, have occupied public spaces and have held rallies and marches in Bangkok in an attempt to force fresh elections.According to eye witness reports the deaths and injuries are as a result of the police use of rubber bullets  and tear gas against the protesters. To which the protesters responded with missiles, pushing and shoving and it is alleged firearms and small bombs. The current clashes follow an attempt by the security forces to clear key areas in the city. A move seen as an attempt to restore authority and dignity to the security forces lost when the Red Shirts succeeded breaking of a security cordon around the Thaicom satellite television station on Friday.Despite the courts ruling that the occupation of public spaces as being illegal and the issuing of 27 arrest warrants for the movements leaders, the protests had until today hitherto been peaceful – if noisy – with Thai security forces showing restraint in the policing of the protests, reluctant to cause bloodshed.The Red shirts consider the Abhisit Vejjajiva administration to be illegitimate having never won an election, and as an undemocratic one imposed on the nation after the Yellow Shirts toppled the elected government of now-fugitive ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra, during the 2008–2009 Thai political crisis. Red Shirt leaders have called for Bhumibol Adulyadej, the King of Thailand, revered by both sides, to intervene and help end the stalemate.In late 2009, the considerable continuing influence of the ex-PM saw him take a post with the Cambodian government. Despite being deposed in the 2006 coup, the ousted Thaksin has been in exile, mostly living in Dubai. He is still influential in Thailand, using protests by the Red Shirts, with the Thai government fearing Thaksin will use Cambodia as base to campaign.However, Thaksin published a letter on his website last November indicating that he did not intend to "go to Cambodia to help Cambodia fight with Thailand [...] As I travel to Cambodia to discuss poverty and the world economic situation, I will try to preserve Thai interests with our friends in Phnom Penh, despite the Thai government still hounding me wherever I go," he stated.Cambodia has made it clear that they will not extradite Thaksin. Cambodian foreign ministry spokesman Koy Kuong said that regarding the jail sentence they are "not concerned about these issues [...] We already clarified this case because he is a political victim."The largest class action in Victorian history was commenced at the Supreme Court of Victoria on Friday the 13th by Slidders Lawyers against electricity distribution company SP AusNet and the Brumby Government in relation to the Kilmore East fire that became part of the Kinglake complex. Because of the lawsuit, SP AusNet SPN.AX's shares on Monday have dropped more than 13.36 per cent or 14.5 cents, to an intra-day low of 94 cents, was at 98.5 cents at 10:38 a.m. local time, before recovering slightly to be 7.5 cents lower at A$1.01 by 1144 AEDT (0003 GMT) or 6.9 percent in Sydney trading. Shares in SP AusNet closed 3.7 percent lower at A$1.045 on Monday.Power supplier SP AusNet said it has asked the Victoria Court regarding the status of the class action proceedings saying the firm had insurance policies in place consistent with industry standards. "SP AusNet will continue to update the market as further information becomes available," the company said.The claim has focused on alleged negligence by SP AusNet in its management of electricity infrastructure. It maintains most of the power lines in eastern Victoria. Its fallen power line is believed to have sparked the blaze that tore through Kinglake, Steels Creek, Strathewen, Humevale, and St Andrews. The plaintiffs include thousands of angry Kinglake farmers, small business owners, tourist operators and residents who lost homes.Leo Keane, the lead plaintiff in the class action has alleged "SP AusNet owed a duty of care to landowners to operate and manage power lines in a way that limited the risk of damage from bushfires."On Thursday Phoenix Taskforce had taken away a section of power line as well as a power pole from near Kilmore East, part of a two-kilometre section of line in Kilmore East that fell during strong winds and record heat about 11am last Saturday. It was believed to have started the fire there, since within minutes a nearby pine forest was ablaze, and within six hours the bushfire had almost obliterated nearly every building in the towns in its path."It is believed that the claim will be made on the basis of negligent management of power lines and infrastructure," Slidders Lawyers partner Daniel Oldham said. The law firm has announced it was helping landowners and leaseholders get compensation for the 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2009 bushfires. "If you have been burnt by the recent bushfires, please register your interest using the form below as soon as possible," the law firm's website stated.The Insurance Council of Australia has placed the cost of the bushfires at about $500 million. "That means keeping electricity lines clear of trees and in a condition that won't cause fires. They must also have systems in place to identify and prevent risks occurring," Melbourne barrister Tim Tobin, QC, said. According to the 2006 census, Kinglake had a population of almost 1,500 people. But SP AusNet's legal liability has been limited at $100 million under an agreement inked by the former Kennett government with private utility operators, when the former State Electricity Commission was privatized in 1995. Accordingly, the Brumby Government could be legally obliged to pay damages of the differences amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.SP AusNet Ltd said some of its electricity assets have been damaged by the Victoria bushfire. "As a preliminary estimate, it is thought that damage has been sustained to approximately one per cent of SP AusNet’s electricity distribution network, mainly distribution poles, associated conductors and pole top transformers," SP AusNet said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). It explained that up to 6,000 homes and businesses on its network were without power due to bushfires, including the Kinglake complex fire, Beechworth fire, and fires across Gippsland including Churchill and Bunyip.SP AusNet said the firm will cooperate fully and will assist in any fire probe. "We stand ready to assist the relevant authorities with their inquiries if it is necessary for us to do so now and in the coming months," SP Ausnet spokeswoman Louisa Graham said in a statement. "Our priority is to restore power to fire-affected areas as quickly as possible. We believe the claim is premature and inappropriate ... SP AusNet will vigorously defend the claim. If the claim is pursued, SP AusNet advises that it has liability insurance which provides cover for bushfire liability. The company's bushfire mitigation and vegetation management programmes comply with state regulations and were audited annually by state agencies," Grahams explained.Victorian Auditor-General Rob Hulls said "there was an 'unseemly rush' by some lawyers to sue before the cause of the fires had been fully investigated." "The government body had audited the network's bushfire risk to make sure required distances between power lines and vegetation were maintained. Power companies had been given a clean bill of health, and electricity firms were judged to be 'well prepared for the 2008-09 bushfire season.' There were no regulations applying to the distances between poles supporting electricity lines and spans of one kilometre were not unusual," a spokesman for Energy Safe Victoria explained.Christine Nixon, the 19th and current Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police said investigations into the cause of the bushfires were ongoing. "I know people are angry, and so are all of us in this community. But we need to kind of have a sense that the proper processes are in place and we need to go through the investigation and through the court case," Nixon said. "At this stage we are not able to confirm how it started. I understand there is some legal action that people are taking, but at this stage we're still investigating its cause. But the whole circumstances of that fire are part of our Taskforce Phoenix, and as we move through that we'll be able to tell the community more once we're able to confirm or deny what we think is the cause of these fires," Nixon added.On Thursday, two people were arrested in connection with the fires, having been observed by members of the public acting suspiciously in areas between Yea and Seymour; although they were both released without charges laid. Brendan Sokaluk, age 39, from Churchill in the Gippsland region, was arrested by police at 4pm on Thursday, in relation to the Churchill fires, and was questioned at the Morwell police station. He was charged on Friday with one count each of arson, intentionally lighting a bushfire and possession of child pornography. The arson case relates to 11 of the 21 deaths in the dire  Gippsland fire, which devastated 39,000 hectares in the Latrobe Valley, Calignee, Hazelwood Koornalla and Jeeralang. Two teams of Churchill firefighters were almost lost in the inferno that remains out of control.Mr Sokaluk joined the CFA Churchill brigade in the late 1980s as a volunteer fire fighter, left in the 1990s and attempted to rejoin twice, but was rejected. He failed to appear in Melbourne Magistrate's Court Monday for a scheduled hearing, since the court reset the committal hearing on May 25. He is represented by lawyer Julian McMahon.Magistrate John Klestadt has lifted the suppression order which kept the suspect's identity a secret but identifying photographs were barred from being released. Mr Sokaluk was remanded in protective custody from Morwell to a cell in Melbourne for his own safety amid fears angry prisoners will target him and real risk of vigilante attacks. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment if convicted on the arson charge. "This is an extraordinary case. The level of emotion and anger and disgust that the alleged offenses have aroused in the community is unprecedented." Mr Sokaluk's defense lawyer Helen Spowart argued. The prosecution has moved the Court for more time to prepare its case, saying there would be up to 200 witnesses to interview. Slater & Gordon has indicated that they were awaiting the report of the to-be-established Royal Commission, expected in late 2010, before initiating any claims.Armed with a $40 million budget, the Royal Commission's Chair Justice Bernard Teague will be assisted by former Commonwealth ombudsman Ron McLeod, who led the inquiry into the 2003 Canberra bushfires, and State Services Authority Commissioner Susan Pascoe. The Commission has said its interim report is due on August 17 while the final report will be submitted by July 31, 2010.Judge Bernard Teague has announced Tuesday he will meet with fire victims and fire authorities within the next two weeks. "We want to do that as soon as possible - probably not next week but starting to have these discussions the week after," he said.Julia Eileen Gillard, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and deputy leader of the federal Australian Labor Party (ALP) said the federal and Victorian governments would respond quickly to the royal commission's report. "Everybody who has lived through this experience in Victoria and around the nation has asked the question: 'Why? What can we do better?'. No one wanted to see the report "as a book on a shelf gathering dust," she said.Victoria bushfire experts, led by Forest Fire Victoria - a group of scientists and forestry experts - have condemned the government's "Living with Fire" policy and the state's failure to initiate serious fuel-reduction programs. The Victoria government had failed to seriously act on bushfire safety recommendations submitted last June by the Victorian Parliamentary Environment and Natural Resources Committee.As death toll rises, evidence mounts of lack of planning prior to Australia’s worst bushfire. "Living with Fire" policy means Kinglake fire trucks were dispatched to an earlier fire in Kilmore, leaving Kinglake undefended. "Kinglake was left with no fire brigade and no police. The trucks had been sent to Kilmore. I've been in the fire brigade for 10 years. There was always a law—the trucks had to be on the hill. Because of the government we got gutted at Kinglake. They should have been getting generators ahead of the fire—so people would have had a chance of fighting it. As soon as the power went, I couldn't keep fighting the fire at my place," Rick and Lauren Watts, and their friend Neil Rao, spoke to the WSWS.Rick has also criticized the lack of early warning communications systems, since emergency siren warnings in the town had been stopped some years earlier. Humevale resident Sina Imbriano who has six children was angry about the failure of  state and federal governments to set up a recommended telephone warning system amid its "stay and defend or go" policy. Bald Spur Road residents Greg Jackson and his wife Fotini said the government's "stay and defend or go" policy was "fruitless" since the critical issue was early warnings,  but "they [the government] just won't spend the money." Also on Friday, five law firms from Victoria's Western Districts, including Warrnambool-based Maddens Lawyers and Brown & Proudfoot, held a meeting to discuss a potential class action in relation to the Horsham fire, which was also thought to have been started by fallen power pole that burnt vast swathes of land in Mudgegonga and Dederang, Victoria. The lawsuit will also focus on the fire that blackened about 1750 hectares at Coleraine.Maddens senior attorney Brendan Pendergast said: "We don't know who the defendant is at this stage. We are unsure who the electrical supplier is for that area but we should know in a few days. There were people who had their homes burnt to the ground and they will need to reconstruct, replace their contents," he said. Maddens has initiated a register of affected landowners for the recent bushfires, saying the firm has included victims of the Pomborneit fire that burnt almost 1300 hectares in the proposed class action amid the CFA's statement the blaze could have been deliberately lit. Frances Esther "Fran" Bailey, Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives (1990-93 and 1996-present), representing the electorate of McEwen in Victoria said the Country Fire Authority (CFA) had told her one of the power lines had broken before the fire. "The local CFA [Country Fire Authority] told me on that Saturday, with those very high winds, one of the lines had broken and was whipping against the ground and sparked," she said. "Whether or not that is the cause of that terrible fire that actually took out Kinglake and maybe Marysville, the investigations will prove that, but we've got to do better," she added.Victorian Premier John Brumby said the power line claim would be examined as part of the Royal Commission into the bushfire. "No stone will be left unturned. So, I think it's important the Royal Commission does its work. And, the Royal Commission will, of course, look at all of the factors with the fires," Mr Brumby said. At least 550 houses were incinerated and 100 people have been killed, leaving more than 1,000 homeless in the Kinglake bushfire and surrounding areas.SP AusNet - Singapore Power International Pte Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore Power Limited (51% interest in SP AusNet). SP AusNet's electricity transmission and distribution networks, along with the gas distribution assets, enable it to deliver a full range of energy-related products and services to industrial and domestic customers in Victoria, Australia.Singapore Power ( 新加坡能源有限公司) is a company which provides electricity and gas transmission, distribution services, and market support services to more than a million customers in Singapore. As the only electricity company in Singapore, and also one of its largest corporation, SP was incorporated as a commercial entity in October 1995 to take over the electricity and gas businesses of the state provider, the Public Utilities Board. Since 1995, Temasek Holdings controls the entire company with a 100% stake. SP is involved in a major investment in Australia's Alinta in partnership with Babcock & Brown, after putting up a bid of A$13.9 billion (S$17 billion), beating out a rival bid by Macquarie Bank.The devastating 2009 Victorian Black Saturday bushfires, a series of more than 400 bushfires across Victoria on February 7 2009, is Australia's worst-ever bushfire disaster, claiming at least 200 deaths, including many young children, and is expected to pass 300. 100 victims have been admitted to hospitals across Victoria with burns, at least 20 in a critical condition, and 9 on life support or in intensive care. The fires have destroyed at least 1,834 homes and damaged many thousands more. Many towns north-east of Melbourne have been badly damaged or almost completely destroyed, including Kinglake, Marysville, Narbethong, Strathewen and Flowerdale. Over 500 people suffered fire-related injuries and more than 7,000 are homeless. It has scorched more than 1,500 square miles (3,900 square kilometers) of farms, forests and towns.The Supreme Court of Victoria is the superior court for the State of Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1852, it is a superior court of common law and equity, with unlimited jurisdiction within the state. Those courts lying below it include the County Court of Victoria, the Magistrates' Court of Victoria and the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (which is technically not a court, but serves a judicial function). Above it lies the High Court of Australia. This places it around the middle of the Australian court hierarchy.Mark Vinar, an Australian climber from Perth, has been presumed dead after falling over half a kilometre from New Zealand's highest peak, Aoraki/Mount Cook. He is said to have lost his footing whilst descending the Zurbriggen Ridge.His brother, Miles Vinar, was rescued by an alpine rescue team after being stranded for two days on a ridge on the mountain and airlifted by helicopter to Plateau Hut in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park on early morning Saturday.Guides at Plateau Hut became concerned for the two brothers on Friday, when the latter did not return as was scheduled.Police reports say that the two brothers were descending the ridge, with Miles Vinar going first: "Miles had to climb down using an ice pick and crampons. He instructed Mark about it, but for some reason Mark lost his footing and fell backwards and started rolling. He went behind some rocks, then appeared again rolling down the hill. He went down about 500 metres and then disappeared," said Omarama police constable Les Andrew, adding that Miles was certain that it was poor that he was obliged to take cover in the snow and wait for rescue."There is no sign of the missing climber and it is presumed he has either fallen into a crevasse and become buried, or has been buried under snow and ice debris," stated the New Zealand Department of Conservation, adding that there had been thirty centimetres of fresh snow.Mark Vinar is the seventieth person to die on Mt Cook in a century, as well as the ninth to die on Zurbriggen Ridge. This is the second death on the mountain in only eight days: Kiyoshi Ikenouchi, a Japanese climber, died after being stranded on Mt Cook for a week, just hours before help arrived.Senior first officer John Coward feared everyone on board British Airways Flight BA38 was going to die in a "catastrophic crash", the Sunday Mirror reports. Coward landed the Boeing 777, registration G-YMMM, by putting it down with a "series of thuds as it bounced along the grass" 400 metres short of the runway threshold, and just within Heathrow's perimeter fence at Hatton Cross last Thursday. All on board survived.Speaking from his family home in France last night he said "As the final approach started I became aware that there was no power. Suddenly there was nothing from any of the engines, and the plane started to glide." This "total loss of power and avionics" occurred at a height of 600ft above Hounslow, two nautical miles from touchdown and within one minute's flying time of the airport. He added: "I didn't think we'd clear the fence at first. As we landed I was bracing myself for an enormous thud. But instead of one thud, there was a series of thuds as it bounced along the grass. Eventually it shuddered to a halt. While I was trying to stop the plane, I struggled to try and keep it in a straight line."Co-pilot Coward was under the command of Captain Peter Burkill, who said Mr Coward had done a "most remarkable job" in landing the aircraft and praised him and all his crew for showing "the highest standards of skill and professionalism".All 136 passengers and 16 crew on board escaped - 18 of the passengers needed treatment including one with a broken leg - there were no fatalities. The plane was removed from the end of runway 27L during the afternoon of Sunday 20th January.Members of the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) have been working on G-YMMM (built in 2001 and one of 43 in the British Airways fleet) continuously since the crash-landing to determine the cause of the failure.State mining officials have said that at least two miners have been killed and another 10 were missing on Monday after an explosion in a mine in eastern Ukraine.51 miners were working in the Skochinsky mine in Donetsk when the accident occurred. 38 of them had managed to escape."One injured person was brought back to the surface by rescue workers and the fate of 10 miners remains unknown," said a State Committee on Workers' Safety spokeswoman, Marina Nikitina.The spokeswoman added that it is believed there had been a blast of methane gas three times, threefold higher than the safety level.The mine's director, Valeri Miminochvili, told reporters that "work is underway to ventilate the shafts and reduce the presence of methane," and that he hopes "we will have managed to clear the wreckage and ventilate the mine in 24 to 36 hours."Rescue operations are currently underway.Update November 21, 2005: All of the 14 miners missing were confirmed dead on Monday, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Seven miners have been killed and seven more are missing after a coal mine flooded in north China's Hebei province. The Xinhua news agency reports the latest coal mine disaster occurred around 5:00 a.m. on Saturday in Xingtai City. A reason for the accident has not yet been given. Owners of the coal mine have been detained by local police and the investigation into the cause of the flooding is underway. State media reports say the disaster occurred at a pit in Xingtai City, but gave few other details. China's mines, many of them illegal, are considered the world's most dangerous. More than 6,000 miners died in accidents in China last year, according to previously released government figures. Other independent estimates put the real figure at around 20,000. Saturday's accident follows a gas explosion at a coal mine in south-western China's Guizhou province on Friday killing at least ten people.Xinhua reports that rescue work is underway, according to the local work safety supervision bureau.A spokesman said Yuanda Coal Mine, a collectively-owned mine in Neiqiu county of Xingtai, was flooded and all the 14 miners working down the pit were trapped.This is the second fatal mine accident in the area in two weeks. Cave-ins at three plaster mines on November 6 caused 33 deaths and left at least four missing.At approximately 6-6:30 am EST, the Sago coal mine, near Buckhannon, experienced an explosion.6 miners escaped shortly after the explosion, but 13 miners are still trapped in the mine, almost one mile underground, where methane gas is accumulating, making rescue efforts difficult.Nearby homes have been evacuated due to the high levels of methane gas, and fans are being used to help disperse the gas.At this time it is unclear what has caused this explosion.The mine is owned by International Coal Group Inc.A search team has found the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) from the wreckage of Kenya Airways Flight 507. The plane, a Boeing 737-800, crashed in Cameroon on May 5, killing all 114 on board.The aircraft's flight data recorder, which records details of what happened to the plane, had previously been located and analysed in Canada. Kenyan authorities had specifically requested that it had been analysed there instead of Europe or the United States, saying that this was preferable due to ongoing strained relations between Boeing and Airbus, and due to the bilingual nature of Canada helping to ease communication between Kenya and Cameroon. Preliminary analysis had found no evidence of mechanical failure. Kenya Airways CEO Titus Naikuni said as part of a statement that Camaroonian authorities were preparing to send the voice recorder to Canada also.So far, the investigation has determined that after reaching an altitude of 3,000 feet shortly after take-off, the plane nose-dived sharply at 45 degrees for thus far undetermined reasons. The CVR analysis is expected to help the investigation to progress as it will allow investigators to analyse the final conversations of the pilots both between themselves and with air traffic control. Authorities have warned that the investigation and final report may take over a year.On Tuesday, Kenya Airways agreed on interim compensation payments of over 1.9 million shillings to the families of the crash victims.An AS350B2 helicopter registered to former champion World Rally Championship driver Colin McRae has crashed near his home in Lanarkshire. Known to be a keen helicopter pilot it has been revealed that McRae was at its controls when it crashed, and burst into flames, killing all aboard.A police statement said: "Around 1610 BST on Saturday, September 15, 2007, emergency services were called to a helicopter crash in Jerviswood... There are no survivors... There will be no formal identification of anyone on board this evening."  The victims were later named by police as Colin McRae (39), his son Johnny (5), the boy's friend Ben Porcelli, and family friend Graeme Duncan (37).David Richards and his wife survived a helicopter crash in Essex whilst returning from the Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix, the day after Colin McRae's helicopter crash, who was his former employee.Due to the damage by Hurricane Katrina and subsequent flooding, a number of colleges and universities in the New Orleans metropolitan area will not be able to hold classes for the fall 2005 semester. It is estimated that 75,000 to 100,000 students have been displaced. [1]. In response, institutions across the United States and Canada are offering late registration for displaced students so that their academic progress is not unduly delayed. Some are offering free or reduced admission to displaced students. At some universities, especially state universities, this offer is limited to residents of the area.On June 13 air traffic controlers in Moscow prevented what ultimately became a near-miss from becoming a serious midair collision. The incident occurred when a Bombardier Challenger 60 business jet violated controllers' instructions and flew into the path of a Boeing 757.According to an official release, the Challenger had been instructed several times to ascend to no higher than 1,800 metres. However, the light jet proceeded to a height of 2,070 metres without authorisation, taking it into the path of a 757 which was approaching nearby Vnukovo International Airport.The two aircraft came close enough that the Traffic Collision Avoidance System on board the Boeing was activated and provided an audible alert to the crew. Meanwhile, air traffic control noticed the emergency and guided the two planes away from each other.According to media reports, a Colombian air force AC-47 (registration FAC1670) spy plane carrying five people has crashed near the Colombian city of La Dorada, in the department of Caldas. All on board the plane are believed to have been killed, according to Colombia Reports. Among the dead, according to Monsters and Critics, are two technicians, a major and two second lieutenants. ABS-CBN News reports that the dead included three high ranking officials and two lower ranking ones.Jorge Ballesteros, a Colombian air force official, says that the plane took off from an air force base in the city of Puerto Salgar and was on an exercise mission when it crashed. He also states that although it was on a training exercise, the plane was carrying bombs and machine guns.A military team has been dispatched to the area to investigate the incident, but they have already put the blame on mechanical failure. Ballestero noted that investigators have ruled out a rebel attack and terrorism as possible causes.AC-47's have been used by the Colombian air force for nearly 20 years, most of which were donated from the United States. They were provided to the country in an attempt to fight the illegal drug market and to defend citizens and the military against rebel attacks. They are also used to gather intelligence and come equipped with a state-of-the-art communications system, radar and infrared detection systems.Reports say that an evacuation has taken place at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado after a bomb threat was phoned into the school."All we know at this point is that there is a bomb threat and that the school has been evacuated. Most of the threats that have been associated to that school made reference to past events that occurred there. But a bomb threat to a school is as serious at any school as it is at Columbine," said Jacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. Kelley added that all people evacuated from the school were initially sent to a park near the school, and that more than one threat was made against the school.Kelley also added that the threats began at about 9:30am local time (4:30 PM UTC).According to Reuters, police have found no evidence of explosives at the scene. However, the bomb squad is still searching and bomb-sniffing dogs are also being used to search the school.According to Marlene Desmond, spokesperson for Jefferson County Schools, there are over 1,850 students at the high school. The entire school was evacuated upon receipt of the bomb threat.In 1999, the school was the scene of a massacre when Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, both students at the school, shot and killed 13 people before taking their own lives. This is the 10th in a series of threats the school faced since then, and is the second time the threats caused the school to evacuate and send students home.In an exclusive interview Jim Shires, Public Information Officer for the Jefferson County Sheriff told Wikinews that it is unknown if this incident was referenced in the current bomb threat. "We won't know more until we speak with the people who actually took the call," Shires said. He added that the school would be closed for the remainder of the day while the investigation continues.The co-pilot and the widow of the pilot of Comair Flight 5191 have sued the United States Federal Aviation Administration, Blue Grass Airport where the crash occurred, and Jeppesen Dataplan Inc, the manufacturer of the airport charts the pilots were using and a subsidiary of Boeing.The co-pilot was the only survivor in the disaster, which killed 49 people one year ago on August 27, 2006. The aircraft crashed after attempting takeoff on the wrong runway, which was only for general aviation and therefore not long enough for use by commercial airliners.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined last month that the primary cause of the accident was most likely pilot error. However, First Officer James Polehinke and Amy Clay, widow of Captain Jeffrey Clay, allege that all three organisations they are suing were also negligent.Despite this, one lead investigator has named other contributing factors, including staffing deficiencies in the control tower, an air traffic controller suffering from fatigue, airport charts that were out of date and the fact that vital documents warning pilots of a route change due to construction work did not reach the aircraft's flight crew.In addition to the other three companies, Polehinke is also suing the company that designed the lighting system in use at the airport.The NTSB's official probable cause for the disaster is as follows: "The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crewmembers’ failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane’s location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross‑check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew’s non-pertinent conversations during taxi, which resulted in a loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration’s failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances."Sydney's transport systems fell into chaos on Friday after gale force winds caused damage to an overhead train line on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Services on the North Shore Line were cancelled, leaving commuters stranded in the city.Just after 2:30 p.m. AEST (UTC+10), a maintenance hatch blew from a train travelling North on the Harbour Bridge hitting overhead lines and landing in northbound traffic lanes. The hatch caused damage to around 300 metres of overhead line, causing Cityrail to cancel services between Wynyard and North Sydney stations.The 30 passengers aboard the train were evacuated and placed onto buses shortly after 3:00 p.m. AEST. The Daily Telegraph reported that passengers feared electrocution, as it was uncertain whether or not the fallen lines had come into contact with the bridge. There were also fears for bridge climbers who were on top of the bridge.The incident causes transport chaos, with bus services replacing trains, traffic congestion on the bridge and the refusal of taxis to carry passengers into the city.Commuters reported queues of up to one kilometre long in North Sydney waiting for buses and around 200 people waiting for buses at Wynyard. It is believed that passengers at Wynyard had to wait some 45 minutes before buses arrived.Commuters criticised the government over the way the incident was handled. Commuters said they felt as if nobody knew what was going on and  Cityrail transit officers did not seem to be in control. The government responded with Transport Minister John Watkins saying that the government did the best it could under the circumstances.Mr Watkins said that the government had arranged "an extra 50 buses to run a shuttle service between North Sydney station and Wynard,""But when you have a major problem like this, a major breakdown in our rail system, it is going to put pressure on our road system and on other public transport."Train services were resumed at around 9:00 p.m. AEST between Wynyard and North Sydney, with Cityrail warning that delays should be expected.Indonesian pilot Marwoto Komar has been arrested over a crash he was involved in. Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 was a Boeing 737 that shot off the runway at Yogyakarta International Airport on March 7 last year, killing 21.The final report into the disaster blamed pilot error for the crash, which killed several Australian journalists following a visit by their foreign minister as well as Indonesian nationals. The investigation determined that Komar was responsible, having brought the plane in at almost double the safe landing speed. He attempted a landing at 408 kph (254 mph), which is 160 kph (100 mph) above the safe speed. The plane overshot the runway, coming to rest in a rice field where it caught fire.On Monday, Komar was arrested. He has been charged with manslaughter over the crash, and if convicted could face five years imprisonment. However, the London-based International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA) commented that they were "saddened" to hear the news.IFALPA contends that further investigations are needed into the crash, and that criminal proceedings could prevent an accurate version of events from ever being known.A statement was released that read as follows: "The Federation expects that Capt. Komar will be released ... as he has agreed to fully cooperate with the police investigation and clearly poses no danger to society. He remains a professional who was involved in an unfortunate tragedy."The former State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers better known as Danvers State Hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts suffered a major fire last night that could be seen for miles and led to temporary shut down of US Route 1 and Interstate 95 in the area.The infamous American former mental hospital has been closed since 1992 is the site of a new condominium and apartment buliding complex being developed by Avalon Bay Communities. Four apartment units and four utilities bulidings went in up in smoke in the four-alarm fire. The units were not occupied, however, two were nearing completion which is a major financial setback for Avalon Bay. The fire did not spread to the famous Kirkbride building though, which is being renovated into apartments, aside from a cupola due to radiant heat.Calls started coming just before 2:00 am EDT Saturday morning to report a fire on the hospital's grounds which before the development sat unused, decaying and abandoned and became a popular target for ghost-hunters, vandals and urban explorers and also served as the focus of the 2001 thriller/horror film, Session 9 which brought renewed attention to infamous hospital which led to increased security at the site over the years. Reports of explosions before the fire started were noted by neighbors and residents.About 20 residents on the other side of the 77-acre property were evacuated to Danvers High School as a precaution, they are expected to return later today. Their homes were not harmed by the fire, nor were any injuries reported from them. However, about seven firefighters suffered some minor burns from battling the fire, which took seven hours to bring under control. Firefighters will remain on the scene to make sure no hot spots flare up as the fire is still smoldering.The cause of the fire is not yet known.U.S Nuclear Regulatory  Secretary Steven Chu reported to Congress Wednesday that the incidents at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant may end up as a larger disaster than the Three Mile Island meltdown faced by the U.S. in 1979. However, he said  reports from Japan officials are contradictory, and concluded that "[w]e don't really know in detail what's happening. We hear conflicting reports."International frustration is focusing on the slow pace and lack of detail characterizing the updates from Japan. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, said Japan needs to provide more frequent and detailed information on the crisis to the world.File:Fukushima-1.JPGCurrently, the lack of information is particularly important regarding the threat posed by reactor number four. The building housing the reactor is no longer on fire, but smoke or steam is visible on television pictures. Yoshitaka Nagayama, a spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, admitted that "[b]ecause we have been unable to go the scene, we cannot confirm whether there is water left or not in the spent fuel pool at Reactor No. 4." Thomas Neff, a reactor safety expert with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: "The problem is that nobody knows. If you don't know and you're TEPCO, you probably underplay it. If you're the regulator, you probably see it in a worse light." "The odds are pretty good that no one has good information," said a former Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner, Peter Bradford, who was on the commission at the time of the Three Mile Island disaster.Jamal al-Bedawi, one of the planners of the USS Cole bombing in 2000 that killed 17 American Navy personnel and injured 39 others in Yemen, has been freed from a prison in Sanaá, the capital of Yemen after he "pleaded allegiance" to the president of the country, and will be kept under house arrest with extreme security.Al-Bedawi, who was serving a death sentence for his role in the attack, escaped from a Yemeni prison in February of 2006 along with another plotter of the attack, Fawaz al-Rabeiee, who has yet to be captured. Al-Bedawi turned himself in to authorities just over two weeks ago. 21 other militants, 13 of which who were members of al-Qaeda, also escaped from the prison.United States officials have described the move as "disappointing." "This action is inconsistent with a deepening of our bilateral counter-terrorism co-operation. We have communicated our displeasure to Yemeni officials," said a U.S. National Security Council spokesman.There has been no official information has yet to be released to the press about the decision or the conditions of al-Bedawi's release.Yemen denied on Sunday media reports that a man convicted over the al Qaeda bombing of the U.S. Navy ship Cole in 2000 had been set free.A construction worker died after falling thirty feet from a New York hotel yesterday, police say.The accident occurred at the Trump SoHo construction site in SoHo, New York. Witnesses at the scene reported that a load being lifted by a crane collided with the building, possibly causing scaffolding to collapse.Police indicated that the dead worker had fallen at least 30 feet. A second worker sustained injuries after falling several storeys into some netting. The injured worker was lowered to street level by crane and transported to hospital as a large number of ambulances and fire engines gathered on the scene. The Trump SoHo building is a 46 storey, 400 unit hotel condominium. According to its website, the building is a joint venture between the Trump Organization, the Sapir Organization, and the Bayrock Group LLC. The site is scheduled to open in Spring 2009.According to BP's chief executive Tony Hayward the equivalent to 10,000 barrels of oil is being captured each day in the Gulf of Mexico by a containment cap. Around 12,000 to 19,000 barrels are leaking each day, implying that more than half of the oil being released is captured by the containment cap.Tony Hayward expressed his company's intention of restoring the Gulf to its original state, after what has been described by many as one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the US. "As we speak, the containment cap is producing around 10,000 barrels of oil a day to the surface." Hayward said. When asked about what amount of the leak the oil being captured represented, he claimed it was "the majority, probably the vast majority". Hayward feels confident that almost all of the leaking oil will be captured in the following week. "We have a further containment system to implement in the course of this coming week which will be in place by next weekend so when those two are in place, we would very much hope to be containing the vast majority of the oil." he said.According to CNN, the US federal government's response manager, Adm. Thad Allen, said it was too early to call the operation a success, while admitting that BP had made progress in the handling of the situation.  "We're making the right progress.  I don't think anyone should be pleased as long as there's oil in the water," he said.Almost 13,000 children in China have fallen sick in a wave of sickness caused by baby's milk contaminated with melamine, a banned chemical which can cause kidney stones, irritation, and ulcers. Most of the sickened children are infants two years or younger, and four children have died from the chemical so far. The Chinese Health Ministry has stated that most of the tainted milk was produced by Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co.'s infant milk powder and have pulled several dairy products off the shelves of Chinese stores. Sanlu, Mengniu and Yili were among the largest brands recalled, and have been attempting to repair their damaged public image. Yili announced that it would be reviewing its manufacturing process and making necessary safety changes. Yang Wenjun, president of Mengniu, apologized for the contamination and promised to make changes as well. Sanlu, meanwhile, has stopped production and is checking all products.The Ministry is conducting an investigation into why the number of illnesses doubled Saturday. Ten percent of yogurt, milk and ice cream is also contaminated, however adults will not be affected if they drink less than two litres a day of the contaminated products. Melamine is an industrial byproduct, infamous for poisoning thousands of pets in the United States in 2007. Investigators believe it was used by desperate dairy companies to disguise diluted milk in dairy products in order to pass quality tests and make higher profits.A man was seriously injured yesterday after a stunt went wrong during a live game show in Germany. Samuel Koch, 23, suffered injuries to his neck and back after he failed to jump over a car being driven by his father on the show Wetten, dass..? (Wanna bet?). The show was halted after the accident for the first time in the show's history.A spokesperson at Dusseldorf University Hospital commented on Koch's condition. He said Koch was "in an extremely critical stage" and warned that he was showing "signs of paralysis".Koch was attempting to jump over five moving cars using spring-powered stilts known as "powerbocks". He jumped over the first three but hit the fourth vehicle and crashed to the floor.Several celebrities were due to perform on the show after the stunt had taken place. Canadian singer Justin Bieber was one of those due to appear. He cancelled his appearance after the accident and released a statement through his Twitter page. The singer said "some things are more important than putting on a show." He also sent his wishes to Koch saying, "Please pray for Samuel Koch and his family as we wait and hope for his health and safety."Wetten, dass..? has been running for 29 years and is shown several times each year. The show features members of the public performing stunts on which the celebrity guests predict the outcome. The show has been known as a family friendly show, however, a German newspaper has questioned whether the show is suitable for children after the accident.The Rheinische Post said, "Since Saturday evening, finally, parents have to think seriously about whether Wetten Dass…? represents an appropriate format for children. It was not really foreseeable that many children would be watching as a contestant sustained life-threatening injuries but there has always been an element of risk surrounding the program."The producers of the show have announced that the programme will continue to broadcast despite the accident. Thomas Bellut, the programme director of the television station, made the announcement ZDF. Bellut told a public radio station, "'Wetten, dass' will certainly continue." He did defend the show's safety standards saying, "We will boost our safety standards once again although we were always of the opinion that they could hardly be more stringent."A Boeing 737 passenger jet owned and operated by Continental Airlines taking off from Denver, Colorado, in the United States ran off the south end of runway 16L/34R and into a ravine at 6:20 PM local time on Saturday. The Houston-bound airplane burst into flames, and the 112 people on board were forced to evacuate the aircraft by the use of slides. Ground crews promptly arrived at the scene, and the fire was swiftly extinguished.Thirty-eight people sustained injuries, such as broken bones, after the accident. Two of the injured were reported to be in critical condition.Patrick Hynes, the Denver Fire Department Division Chief, stated that the fire associated with the crash burnt the entire right side of the plane, causing melted plastic from the overhead compartments to drip onto seats below them.Mike Wilson, a passenger on board the airplane, described the accident and the chaos that followed: "By the time the plane stopped we were burning pretty well and I think I could feel the heat even through the bulkhead and window. I made for the exit door as quickly as I could, fearing the right wing might explode from the fire. Once out, I scrambled down the wing."The cause of the accident has not been confirmed, but preliminary reports indicate that a braking malfunction may be to blame. The weather in Denver at the time of the crash was cold, but not snowy. Kim Day, the Denver International Airport manager of aviation, reported that the airplane went off course about 2 000 feet off the end of the runway, and did not seem to be airborne.The accident forced the west airfield of the airport to shut down, and resulted in delays of 40 minutes.  The runway re-opened Monday, December 22 by 6:00 P.M.United States air carrier Continental Airlines and two of their employees have been charged over the crash of Air France Flight 4590. The disaster involved a Concorde crash on July 25, 2000 near Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Paris, France that killed all 109 on board and four more on the ground. It was carrying mostly German tourists to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.The crash occurred after a metal strip detached from a Continental DC-10 that departed before the Concorde and was left behind on the runway. When Concorde took off afterwards it hit the strip, which punctured a tyre. As the tyre disintegrated a piece of debris punctured a fuel tank, triggering a large fire as the jet took off. The badly damaged aircraft crashed into a hotel before it was able to perform an emergency landing. The final report was not released until 2004.One Continental employee, mechanic John Taylor, is being charged over making and installing the non-standard strip. Head of maintenance Stanley Ford is being charged for allowing the part to be modified by Taylor without clearing the changes properly, and the airline is charged for allowing the widebodied passenger jet back into the air and having failed to maintain it adequately. It is also claimed the titanium strip should have been made of softer aluminium, which had a lower risk of damaging tyres.Three further individuals have been charged as well. Henri Perrier, head of the initial Concorde programme at Aerospatiale, Jacques Herubel, Concorde chief engineer at the time and Claude Frantzen, ex-head of technical services at the French civil aviation authority are all facing charges. The charges are primarily for involuntary manslaughter.As a result of the Concorde disaster the aircraft was grounded pending emergency modifications. It was official removed from service in 2003 by its only two operators, British Airways and Air France. The model's first commercial flight was in 1976, and it was the world's first supersonic airliner. It was developed as a collaboration between Britain and France.Spain's Ministry for Development has leaked a preliminary report into the crash of Spanair Flight 5022. The McDonnel-Douglas MD-82 that was lost at Madrid's Barajas Airport in Spanair's first and only fatal accident resulted in the deaths of 154. Controversy has come as a result of both the documents' contents and the fact that it was leaked at all.According to the report, the airliner was defective for as yet undetermined reasons. The wing flaps failed to move into the required configuration for takeoff, and the alarm system that would normally alert pilots failed to activate, leaving the pilots unaware of the impending crash. The report goes on to note that after a similar accident befell Northwest Airlines Flight 255 in the United States in 1987, also with 154 dead, manufacturer McDonnel-Douglas (since merged with Boeing) told operators of MD-82s that they recommended pilots verified the alarm system was operational before every takeoff.Spanair, however, did not follow this advice and instead trained pilots to check the system before the first takeoff each day and after each change in flight crew. The plane had been taken to Madrid from Barcelona earlier that day with the same flight crew, and therefore the pilots were not expected to check the alarm.File:Columnas de humo del accidente aéreo de Madrid-Barajas (2008).jpgSpanair's director of operations, Javier Muela, has responded by denial that the primary cause of the crash was the alarm's failure, as was implied by the report. He did confirm that the airline was not following the recommendation from the airframer, but in his defense said that "Spanair did not exist" at the time - "it was made in 87, Spanair was founded in 88," he said. He also said the airline's independent experts did not believe the reports claims about the incorrect flap position was accurate.Typically, airliners come with documents detailing operating recommendations among other details, but newspapers have not confirmed that Spanair did in fact receive this information with any of its MD-82s.Regardless of the report's accuracy, further controversy has arisen over its status, with a pilots' union enraged over the fact that it was ever made public. The Pilots College, COPAC, expressed an intention to bring legal action against the Ministry for Development. The union say the ministry broke protocols on both confidentiality and law.Meanwhile, the investigation continues. It remains unclear why the systems on the aircraft failed, if they indeed did, although Spanish paper El Pais speculates it may be linked to a faulty temperature gauge on one of the engines, which caused the first attempted takeoff to be aborted and delayed the flight an hour. Javier Pérez, the judge in charge of the investigation, will examine the contents of the aircraft's flight recorders tomorrow. It is also reported that he is unlikely to call any witnesses to the disaster.Tuesday, Yahoo! News posted photographs from the Hurricane Katrina disaster area gathered from various sources.An Associated Press photograph of two African-American women was captioned, "Looters carry bags of groceries through floodwaters after taking the merchandise away from a wind damaged convenience store in New Orleans on Monday, Aug. 29, 2005."A similar Agence France-Presse (AFP) photograph of two caucasians was labeled, "Two residents wade through chest-deep water after finding bread and soda from a local grocery store in New Orleans..."The vast majority of people who did not evacuate from the famous city were poor and black; many were unable to obtain transportation.Several news sites have noted that New Orleans rescue and evacuation efforts have been severely complicated by the presence of these looters. The evacuation of the Superdome was halted after shots were reported, fired at a National Guard rescue helicopter.Yahoo! News later released a statement on the images, saying, "...we present the photos and their captions as written, edited and distributed by the news services with no additional editing..." Yahoo! agreed to AFP's request to remove AFP-supplied photographs after the controversy began, fueled by articles on the topic by Salon, Flickr, and other news sites.The choice of wording may be chalked up to different policies at the two agencies (AP and AFP); the AP has been labeling several of their photos with the term "looting" if their photographers witness the act, while Getty spokeswoman Bridget Russel said regarding the AFP/Getty photo, "This is obviously a big tragedy down there, so we're being careful with how we credit these photos."Chris Graythen, who took the AFP picture and wrote the caption, said "I believed in my opinion, that they did simply find them, and not 'looted' them in the definition of the word. The people were swimming in chest deep water, and there were other people in the water, both white and black. I looked for the best picture. there were a million items floating in the water - we were right near a grocery store that had 5+ feet of water in it. it had no doors. the water was moving, and the stuff was floating away. These people were not ducking into a store and busting down windows to get electronics. They picked up bread and cokes that were floating in the water. They would have floated away anyhow."New Orleans' Mayor Ray Nagin is facing criticism over the evacuation of citizens before Hurricane Katrina struck.In the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina, hundreds of buses were sitting in bus yards, some less than a mile from the Superdome. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco commented, "The buses could have saved an estimated 20,000 people if they had been used for emergency evacuations which President Bush had declared two days before Katrina hit.", however the evacuation was ordered by Mayor Nagin, President Bush having no direct authority to order evacuations. Thursday, after the storm, Blanco by executive order used school buses for evacuation. The 2000 edition of the southeast Louisiana evacuation plan on page 13, paragraph 5 states:5. The primary means of hurricane evacuation will be personal vehicles. School and municipal buses, government-owned vehicles and vehicles provided by volunteer agencies may be used to provide transportation for individuals who lack transportation and require assistance in evacuating.There were however alternative emergency plans, including ones held by state Homeland Security offices, and it is unclear which one was being operated to.The Superdome had been opened shortly before the storm as a shelter of last resort for those who had not evacuated.  As FEMA observed at that time: "Most residents have evacuated the city and those left behind do not have transportation or have special needs." Roughly 150,000 people were not evacuated from the city. During the Hurricane Ivan evacuation 600,000 people failed to evacute the city.According to WWLTV, during a news conference on Sunday before the hurricane struck, Mayor Nagin claimed he "could and would commandeer any property or vehicle it deemed necessary to provide safe shelter or transport for those in need". However photos circulated appear to show unused school and privately owned busses left stranded in flood waters. It is unclear whether Mayor Nagin knew these particular buses existed, since the Orleans Parish School Board is not under his jurisdiction and his office would not normally know the location of OPSB bus yards or be able to contact the drivers of those buses to place them into service. Normally it is the job of FEMA to coordinate between the various local jurisdictions such as the OPSB and the City of New Orleans in this case. That is, under the rules of prior hurricane responses, FEMA would ask all local jurisdictions for a list of resources under their control. Then FEMA would have taken a request from Nagin for buses, relayed it to the Orleans Parish School Board or other local jurisdictions which had buses, and at that point the OPSB would have provided the buses to Nagin. That coordination did not happen here, but it is unclear whether Nagin ever made such a request prior to the hurricane and after the hurricane they were underwater and useless. However, if he had known about them, the declaration of a state of emergency on August 26 gave him the right under Louisiana law to commandeer them for the duration of the emergency.  The failure to issue a timely evacuation order in effect made it physically impossible to evacuate the nursing homes, hospitals, and those without automobiles.In a radio interview on WWL-AM shortly after the hurricane, Mayor Nagin said, " I need 500 buses, man. We ain't talking about -- you know, one of the briefings we had, they were talking about getting public school bus drivers to come down here and bus people out here.  I'm like, "You got to be kidding me. This is a national disaster. Get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country and get their asses moving to New Orleans." "Three bomb explosions have hit London Underground trains, and a further bomb destroyed a bus in the city centre. The Metropolitan Police Service has initially confirmed that 33 people have been killed in the four explosions on London's transport system this morning, and said the overall number of wounded was as high as 700, in what are believed to be terrorist attacks.  (See later reports in the box at the side for later announcements made on following days.) The first reports were of an explosion at 08:49 BST (UTC+1) on the Hammersmith & City Line between Liverpool Street station and Aldgate East.  Explosions also occurred on a train between King's Cross and Russell Square and another at Edgware Road. The explosions are currently being reported, and described by Prime Minister Tony Blair, as being "terrorist attacks." Traces of explosives were found at two of the sites according to the BBC.Scotland Yard has confirmed one explosion onboard a double decker red London bus travelling south outside the British Medical Association on Tavistock Square. Police cannot confirm whether this bomb was intended for another train and accidentally detonated aboard the bus instead.Pundits are speculating the attack was co-ordinated by al-Qaeda. Dr. Shane Brighton, an intelligence expert at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence, claims that, "If what we are looking at is a simultaneous bombing — and it does look like that — it would very certainly fit the classic al Qaeda methodology." Two militant Islamist groups are reported to have claimed responsibility for the blasts.The rescue of the Chilean miners trapped in the San José Mine in Copiapó, codenamed Operación San Lorenzo (San Lorenzo Operation), began on Tuesday night, at around 20:00 local time (23:00 UTC).Florencio Ávalos was the first miner to be rescued, at 00:12 local time (03:12 UTC) on Wednesday. He was wearing a shirt signed by all his fellow miners. "The first miner is already with us. We saw it all, him hugging his wife Monica and his son Byron," said President Piñera shortly after the first rescue. "We still have a long journey.""This will be recorded on every single Chilean heart forever," Piñera added. "I hope the miners' hope stay with us, just like the [February] earthquake victims' [hope] and what the earthquake took off. We know that the disasters unite us all."All the 33 miners were rescued. The last miner, Luis Urzúa, was rescued at 21:55 Chile time (00:55 UTC). "It is a pleasure to be Chilean, [I'm] proud," said Luis Urzúa to President Piñera. "In honour of the miners, their families, the rescuers [...] let's sing our national anthem. Viva Chile Mierda!," said Piñera. Urzúa thanked Mining Minister Golborne and the First Lady Cecilia Morel for "fighting for their lives." "I'm proud of my fellow miners," Urzúa added.Six rescuers, including a miner and a paramedic, descended to the miners' shelter using the Fénix 3 capsule which was specially constructed for the rescue. They performed check-ups and talk with the miners before taking them back to the surface. The rescuers still don't leave the mine.The Fénix 3 capsules are 3.95 metres in height and weigh about 460 kilograms. They have an armour, an oxygen tube and a microphone. The occupants helmets contain an intercom to keep them in contact with the rescue team on the surface.President of Chile Piñera assisted to the rescue. Bolivian President Evo Morales could not attend Carlos Mamani's rescue. Mamani is the only Bolivian miner in the group.A mass for the miners was conducted at 18:00 local time (21:00 UTC). The rescue takes between 15 and 20 minutes for each miner.On Tuesday, Mayor of Copiapó Maglio Cicardini announced that the municipal schools in the city will have no classes this Wednesday "to transform the rescue of the Atacama's 33 in a familiar meeting," Radio Cooperativa reported."The miners will be taken to the Copiapó Regional Hospital for medical checkup, where they will have to stay for 48 hours," Health Minister Mañalich said to Televisión Nacional de Chile.Celebrations are taking place in several Chilean cities. In Santiago de Chile, people gathered in one of the most important points of the city, Plaza Italia. In Pichilemu, tens of cars are passing over its most important streets. In Copiapó, people gathered in its main square to assist a massive concert.A report from French safety officials released on Wednesday said the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, practiced putting a plane into a controlled descent earlier in the day of the March 24 crash of Germanwings Flight 9525, which officials allege the co-pilot caused by a controlled descent. The report was based on data from the plane's flight recorders.According to the report, the flight data recorder indicated the captain left the cockpit for a few minutes. During these few minutes, air traffic control told the Airbus A320 to decend from 37,000 to 35,000 feet. But the co-pilot has set the altitude to a much lower than that before going back to 35,000 feet.The co-pilot then set the altitude close to the ground again after air traffic control instructed descent to 21,000 feet. The plane remained on its flight path throughout, so there was no deviation from flight path for air traffic controllers to notice. The report does not say whether the pilot on the "test" flight also piloted the accident flight.In Wamsutter, Wyoming, US, a fire crew were trying to put out a fire of a wine truck on a highway when they received an unexpected surprise.Wine corks started to burst out of the wreckage as bottles started to explode from the heat. Wyoming Highway Patrol Lt. Scott Keane said: "The corks were popping out of the bottles like the old  Jiffy Pop (popcorn) we grew up with. My trooper got hit in the arm with one."But luckily, as Keane commented, no one was killed or seriously injured and the truck driver managed to escape the fire, which occurred on Thursday after a crash on Interstate 80.The intensity of the fire caused the tires on the trailer to melt down and the trailer to burn down to its wheel axles, damaging 75 feet of pavement in the process. Keane stated that the cause of the fire was likely to be either a locked brake or a hub malfunction.  It is currently unknown what the value of the loss in the fire was.  The Wyoming Department of Transportation have commented that there was nothing left of the cab or trailer and the remaining bottles of wine from Oregon and Washington had disappeared overnight.Police have bailed the driver of a coach which crashed on Tuesday in Cornwall, England, killing two people.The driver was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following fatal injury of two elderly women when the coach reportedly hit a wall. A further seven passengers, seriously injured in the crash, were hospitalised.Devon and Cornwall Police reported being alerted to the incident, about three miles (five kilometres) from the town of Looe, at approximately 1:00pm local time (1200 UTC) on Tuesday. The force arrested the 57-year-old male coach driver from Exeter on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released on bail.The cause of the crash is not yet known although police say they are investigating the incident, in which no vehicle other than the coach was involved. The passengers were travelling on a coach trip from Exmouth to Looe with Age UK.The first findings from the preliminary investigations into Sunday's air disaster have been released. All 121 on board a Helios Boeing 737 died when it crashed near Athens after flying from Cyprus. A text message, reportedly sent from the doomed aircraft, has also been revealed as a hoax.Greek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated "Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs. "That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive."Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were "frozen solid" at the moment of impact.The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.Nothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.Helios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.Greek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.Police have also attended Helios's offices to requisition documents as part of the investigation into the disaster.It has also been revealed that Helios is owned by a British company, Libra Holidays Group. Helios are giving the relatives of each victim €19,000 in initial compensation, as is required by the Montreal Convention and EU regulations.Countries and organizations from around the world are sending aid and help to victims of the devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti on Tuesday, damaging many buildings. The death toll is currently unknown, but estimated to run into the tens of thousands of people.US president Barack Obama said in a press conference that "I've directed my administration to launch a swift, coordinated and aggressive effort to save lives and support the recovery in Haiti."Obama announced that aid from the US armed forces was coming to Haiti, noting, "Several Coast Guard cutters are already there providing everything from basic services like water, to vital technical support for this massive logistical operation."Obama continued: "[...] today, I'm also announcing an immediate investment of $100 million to support our relief efforts.  This will mean more of the life-saving equipment, food, water and medicine that will be needed. This investment will grow over the coming year as we embark on the long-term recovery from this unimaginable tragedy."Obama said that the US would forge partnerships with Haitian people and Haitian-Americans, along with United Nations peacekeepers. He closed by saying, "To the people of Haiti, we say clearly, and with conviction, you will not be forsaken; you will not be forgotten.  In this, your hour of greatest need, America stands with you. The world stands with you."The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon said that $10 million is being released from the international organization's central emergency response fund.Meanwhile, the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), which already has an existing operation in the country, is beginning to distribute high energy biscuits which require no preparation before eating. On top of that, the WFP is airlifting 86 metric tons of food from their emergency hub in El Salvador.A spokesperson for the WFP said, "In a normal day the World Food Programme will be feeding one or two million people in Haiti — and now we need to do even more, because the people have lost everything."China is also pledging aid to the country, despite the lack of official diplomatic ties between the two countries. Haiti recognizes the Republic of China, better known as Taiwan. Nevertheless, China has sent a 60 member search and rescue team to Haiti and the Chinese Red Cross is donating one million dollars in emergency aid.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu said her country expresses sympathy to the Haitian government and people. Jiang says the Chinese foreign minister has sent a telegram of condolence to his Haitian counterparts.An 80 member team from the United Kingdom of search and rescue specialists has arrived in Haiti to help in efforts there. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in a joint press conference with Toaiseach of Ireland Brian Cowen that the team has arrived in the country. He also announced that the government is pledging to match the UN's US$10 million (£6.1 million). Brown said, “It is a tragedy beyond imagination and there is a deep sense of loss felt by the whole of the British and Irish people about the tragedy that individual families in Haiti are experiencing at the moment. We send our message of sympathy and support to the people of Haiti at this most difficult of times."He added, “Where men, women and children are suffering under the heaviest of burdens, that place must, for that moment, become the centre of our world’s attention, the world’s compassion and the world’s humanitarian help.”France is also sending aid to the French-speaking country, which at one time was a colony of France known as Saint-Domingue. France is sending two planes with rescuers and aid. Civil safety authorities in France are sending a team of 130 members consisting of rescuers, trained rescue dogs, doctors and nurses along with 12,000 tons of aid and rescue supplies.Israel is sending rescue forces in two El Al planes carrying a 121-member delegation that includes 40 doctors, five search-and-rescue teams, and an army rescue squad. The IDF medical teams are preparing to spend two weeks in Haiti. Spain has pledged $4.3 million (€3 million) in aid money and has 150 tons of aid ready to be delivered.South Africa is sending a team of search and rescue specialists to Haiti in response to the devastating earthquake on Tuesday.  It is the first of several teams being sent by a local civic group.The head of South Africa's Gift of the Givers Foundation, Emtiaz Sooliman, says his group is sending up to three teams of search and rescue specialists to Haiti to help victims of the earthquake and hopefully save some lives."These are people who have worked with building collapses, urban search and rescue and some of them have been involved in responding to previous earthquakes so they are highly skilled," he said.Sooliman says a second team is to depart as soon as he can book a flight for it.A two-vehicle road traffic accident in County Donegal in Ireland has left one person dead and injured two others. The accident occurred when a camper van collided with an oncoming car on the N15 road between the towns of Ballybofey and Donegal at approximately 1540 BST (1440 UTC) on Monday.The fatality was reportedly a man in his 70s from the town of Lifford; he has not yet been publicly identified. He was taken to Letterkenny General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The female passenger he was travelling in the car with, thought to be the wife of the man, was taken to the same hospital after suffering serious injuries.The man and woman in the camper van were transported to Sligo Regional Hospital. The condition of the two occupants is not clear, although the woman in the vehicle reportedly injured her leg in the accident.The road where the crash occurred was closed to allow the Garda to investigate the incident.In a unanimous decision, a US federal appeals court issued a ruling Friday against the federal government, in favor of Massey Energy Co, owner of the Upper Branch Mine in West Virginia, the location of last year's mine disaster that killed 29 workers. The court ruled the company may appeal the restrictions placed on it by a government order hindering the company's ability to conduct its own internal investigation of the disaster. The order controlling Massey's investigations into the disaster was placed on Massey immediately after the incident by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) when it seized control of the coal mine six hours after the blast on April 5.MSHA's controls prohibited Massey from "taking or retaining photographs, collecting and preserving mine dust samples, employing mine mapping technology, and participating in or objecting to any destructive testing of materials gathered underground." Massey said MSHA's restrictions prevented the company from evaluating the accident site before it was altered by investigators, and denied Massey the chance to gather evidence to use in the company's defense.Massey's appeal to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the commission that decides disputes over mining regulations) to void the order by MSHA was denied by the commission. It based its decision on its interpretation of the Mine Act that it had no authority to consider Massey's appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside this decision, finding the commission's interpretation of the act was "simply untenable" and the government's actions had denied Massey the opportunity to gather "potentially important exculpatory evidence".The court rejected the commission's position that the Mine Act's language was ambiguous, allowing the government flexibility in its implementation. Rather, the court said, "No matter how you parse it, [the act] is a model of near-perfect clarity. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a clearer expression of congressional language." It also rejected the commission's position that the case was moot: "This case is not moot. Indeed, even the [Labor] Secretary's counsel recognized the near-frivolity of this argument, and made only a half-hearted attempt to persuade us."The court's ruling comes after a state government-comissioned report issued on May 19 by investigators found Massey Energy responsible for the deaths of the 29 workers. The workers were killed in an explosion that could have been avoided, the report said, if Massey had put in place standard safety procedures."The story of Upper Big Branch is a cautionary tale of hubris. A company that was a towering presence in the Appalachian coal fields operated its mines in a profoundly reckless manner, and 29 coal miners paid with their lives for the corporate risk taking," the report read. "The company's ventilation system did not adequately ventilate the mine. As a result, explosive gases were allowed to build up." The report detailed claims Massey threatened miners with termination if they stopped work in areas that lacked adequate oxygen levels and listed numerous other state and federal safety standards that Massey failed to follow. Also blamed in the report was MSHA for failing to enforce federal regulations.The report was considered by the those in the mining industry as especially direct and "hard hitting". It firmly rejected conclusions reached by Massey officials that the incident was caused by an unexpected, massive, and uncontrollable methane bubble eruption, an occurrence that Massey said it could neither predict nor manage.  The company immediately challenged the report and issued its own report on June 3, blaming the blast on an act of nature and denying the company's safety culture was at fault. MSHA also have an as-yet unreleased report in the works.A crane collapsed Friday in Houston, Texas killing 4 people and injuring 7 more. The crane, which stood 30-stories-tall, fell down at the LyondellBasell oil refinery in Houston, Texas. The crane could lift up to 1 million pounds."This is a traumatic experience for all of us. We have to focus on the safety and health of our employees," said Jim Roecker of LyondellBasell.The company has about 3,000 employees at the oil refinery and another 1,500 contract workers.Margaret Landry, a spokesperson for Deep South Crane & Riggen, which built, owned and operated the crane, said: "It is a family-owned business, and we are grieving right now with our employees and families going through this tragedy. We're just getting through it."Occupational Safety and Health Administration began its onsite investigation on Saturday.A construction crane fell from a New York City condominium on Saturday afternoon, demolishing a four-story townhouse and killing four construction workers.At least ten people were injured in the accident, three of them critically, mayor Michael Bloomberg said. "This accident is one of the worst the city has had," said the mayor. "Our thoughts go to the families. I hope we will not find other victims." He added that authorities are investigating the cause of the accident.The crane broke into pieces as it fell from a height of 15 or 20 stories, according to witnesses. It hit three residential buildings in the course of the fall and completely crushed the aforementioned townhouse, which housed a bar on the first floor. "The top of the crane went right through the building, and it sliced it in half," said Maryann Krajacic, who lives next to the townhouse.The bar was closed when the crane fell, but John LaGreco, who owns the bar, fears one of his employees may be dead within the rubble. "Our bar is done," he said. "If I wasn't watching a Yankees game, I would've come to work early and gotten killed."Cars were overturned and buried in rubble, and the air was filled with clouds of smoke and dust. Around 150 police officers blocked off the area, and 300 firefighters frantically searched for any additional victims. The search could continue all night, said Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta, and would include search dogs and thermal-imaging, and listening devices.More than half a dozen buildings in the vicinity were evacuated, and a Red Cross shelter was set up nearby.Stephen Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group, says the accident resulted from a falling piece of steel, which severed one of the ties holding the crane to the building. "All the piece of steel had to do was fall slightly left or right, and nothing would have happened," Kaplan said.Manhattan Borough president Scott Stringer said local residents had often complained about security violations in the building's construction; they asserted that crews worked illegal hours and that the building was going up too quickly. "Over the last year, this is becoming standard in my borough," Stringer said. "I think we have a real issue here."On March 4, a caller told officials that the crane lacked a sufficient number of safety ties. It was inspected March 6, and no violation was issued. The crane was also inspected Friday, the day before the accident.A crash has killed nine people on a turnpike (toll road) northeast of Miami, Oklahoma. The accident occurred on Friday when a semi-trailer truck struck a line of stationary traffic from behind on the Will Rogers Turnpike near state lines with Missouri and Kansas.Traffic had come to a standstill as a result of an earlier accident eastbound when the accident occurred. The road has a speed limit of 75 mph, and it is currently thought that the truck driver made no attempts to stop his vehicle. He was hospitalised. A spokesperson for the nearby Freeman Hospital said eight people were treated there, and it is reported a twelve-year-old girl is among the injured.The girl had to be cut free from the wreckage of her car, and was taken to the Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City where she was in critical condition. Her parents were both killed. The accident occurred at 1p.m., and it was four hours before any eastbound lanes re-opened, leaving vehicles stranded in high temperatures and prompting emergency services to distribute water to motorists.Also killed are an Oklahoma City family of four and a seven-year-old Texas girl and her father. The mother from that family is in a critical condition, and another woman was also killed in the same car.Lt. George Brown of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol described the scene: "It looks like a war zone. There's mangled metal everywhere. There's debris, fluids, dead bodies." A man who has worked thirty years as a tow truck driver said the crash was "the worst one I've ever worked."A number of other smaller incidents occurred in the area afterwards. At least three accidents were caused by vehicles slowing down in response to the crash, and four cars collided with each other westbound. No-one was killed in the other accidents.It took hours to locate the last fatality, who was in a car pinned under the semi-trailer. Two tow trucks were required to separate the vehicles. A total of seven vehicles were involved, including three cars which were beneath the truck by the end of the accident sequence.A criminal investigation has been launched. A blood sample has been taken from the truck driver, 76-year-old Donald Creed, who has been released from hospital after treatment. There is no indication alcohol was a factor in the accident.Reports out of New Orleans on September 1 stated that victims of Hurricane Katrina were being raped and beaten and that fights and fires were out of control, leaving corpses laying in the open as the city descended into anarchy. “We have individuals who are getting raped, we have individuals who are getting beaten,” New Orleans Police Chief Eddie Compass said. Compass said that the 15,000 to 20,000 people who were at the New Orleans convention center awaiting buses grew increasingly hostile and had beat back 88 officers he had sent there to try to keep the peace.“Tourists are walking in that direction and they are getting preyed upon,” Compass had said.Reports of rampant violence though may have been overblown, even by New Orleans standards, as many reports of sensational violence have not been verified. "During a week when communications were difficult, rumours have acquired a particular currency. They acquired through repetition the status of established facts." Indeed, White House press secretary Scott McClellan told a group of journalists on Wednesday that "martial law has been declared in Mississippi and Louisiana." though this was never the case as such a move would require a situation of lawlessness beyond the scope of local authorities to handle.The crisis at a stricken nuclear plant on the northeast coast of Japan is now as severe as the disaster at Chernobyl in 1986, officials have said. Radiation is continuing to leak from the plant, which was damaged during the devastating magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami last month, which left thousands dead. Japanese authorities have warned the crisis is now a "major accident" with "wider consequences" than previously thought.A spokesperson for NISA, the Japanese government nuclear authority, said officials had upgraded the crisis to a level seven on the International Nuclear Event Scale—the same applied to the Chernobyl disaster—because of a number of factors, including the detection of radiation in crops. "We have upgraded the severity level to seven as the impact of radiation leaks has been widespread from the air, vegetables, tap water and the ocean," he said.TEPCO, the operator of the plant, has warned radiation was continuing to leak from the site and the magnitude of the crisis could exceed that of Chernobyl. Despite this, Japanese nuclear safety officials have insisted the leakage of radiation was small compared to the devastated plant in the former Soviet Union. "In terms of volume of radioactive materials released, our estimate shows it is about ten percent of what was released by Chernobyl," one nuclear official said.File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe 2.jpgThe news comes as a new blow after another powerful aftershock yesterday which left at least six people dead after they were killed in a mudslide in the city of Iwaki. The landslide, which destroyed numerous homes, was triggered by a magnitude 6.6 aftershock which came exactly a month after the 9.0 magnitude earthquake. Fire officials in the city said three people had already been rescued and taken to hospital, and emergency workers were working to free an unknown number of others.Workers at the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant returned after they were briefly evacuated following the earthquake, and officials issued tsunami warnings for the northeast coast which were later cancelled. Workers have been fighting a desperate battle to prevent the reactors from overheating and entering meltdown. Raging fires burned into the night after the earthquake, and TEPCO reported widespread power outages; hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses had power cut off.Reports of the change in severity at the damaged nuclear plant followed the announcement that the exclusion zone around the site was to be expanded. A spokesperson for the government confirmed the radius of the zone would be expanded to include another five communities over the next several weeks. He stressed there was "no need to evacuate immediately" but said concerns had been raised over health risks from the leaking radiation.The new development at the plant and the aftershock are new blows to a country wounded after the massive earthquake in March, which caused a tsunami that washed away whole towns and villages along the country's northeast coast. Thousands of bodies have been recovered, and many more are still unaccounted for, many left under mounds of rubble or washed out to sea. More than 150,000 people remain displaced, living in emergency shelters.Before the aftershock struck yesterday, survivors of the first earthquake marked the time it hit a month ago with a moment of silence across the country. Writing to seven international newspapers, Naoto Kan, the Japanese prime minister,  expressed his gratitude to people globally for their support. "Through our own efforts and with the help of the global community, Japan will recover and come back even stronger. We will then repay you for your generous aid," he wrote. "With this in our hearts, we now stand together dedicated to rebuilding the nation."Portuguese football player Cristiano Ronaldo has been involved in a car crash in Manchester, in the United Kingdom.The Manchester United winger who also plays internationally for Portugal crashed his Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano at 10:20 a.m. on Friday January 9. The car, worth approximately £200,000 ($305,000) was totally destroyed. A wheel came off the car and debris was placed all over the road. Ronaldo was not injured during the crash and no other vehicles were involved. Team mate, Goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar was said to be following behind Ronaldo.Ronaldo turned up for training later in the day. He has been with Manchester United since 2003 and scored 74 goals in 178 games. He has also scored 21 goals for Portugal and has competed for them in Euro 2004 and 2008 as well as the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2004 Summer Olympics. He returned to the training ground in his £150,000 Bentley.Police released a statement saying "at about 10:20 a.m. police were called to the A538 Wilmslow Road near to Manchester Airport following reports of a road traffic collision. Officers attended and discovered a Ferrari had collided with a barrier. No one is believed to have been injured. Inquiries are continuing." The statement also added that Ronaldo was not intoxicated.An elderly woman who was a crossing guard or a "lollipop lady" has been killed in an accident involving a truck in Glasgow, Scotland. The woman has been identified as 59-year-old Catherine Gibson, who came from the Dennistoun district of Glasgow. At around 0850 GMT on Thursday, Gibson was assisting children in crossing a road as part of her job near St. Anne's Primary School, located in the east side of the city. Gibson was suddenly struck by a truck and dragged underneath the wheels of the vehicle. The children being assisted witnessed the entire collision.After the accident occurred, Gibson was transported to a hospital but died shortly afterwards. The truck driver, who is aged 64, was not injured in the crash. The vehicle itself was taken away from the scene of the accident at approximately 1200 GMT on the same day. A person working in a garage near where the accident occurred said: "There were children waiting to cross the road and they were all screaming and crying. They all ran back from where the accident had happened. She was found face down and it looked as though the lorry had driven over her shoulder. She was alive when she was found but died a short time later. It was horrific and the kids will probably need counselling."It could have been a case of the driver not being able to see her because the vehicle is quite high as he caught her on the passenger side. It's not clear whether she gave him enough time to stop or whether the driver has failed to stop. It was snowing as well so that could have been a factor."Louise Jarvie is the head teacher of St. Anne's Primary School. "Our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this very sad time," she said in reference to the incident. "Support and counselling for pupils and staff will be available to anyone who needs it."A cruise ship caught fire 32 km (20 miles) off the southeast coast of England. The blaze started in the engine-room of the Calypso, which had 708 passengers and crew onboard. The passengers were mainly Dutch.Specialist firefighters transported by helicopter from the East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service tackled the fire.It was tugged to Southampton by the Anglican Monarch, a tug boat jointly operated by England and France. The relieved passengers left to boat 16 hours after the fire started. "A team will be going onboard to assess the situation, so time will tell," said the Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokeswoman.There were no causualties and no evacuation.An evacuation operation was carried out today as a cruise ship ran aground off the coast of Santorini, a Greek island, leaving up to 1,167 passengers and 391 crew to abandon the ship.The Sea Diamond took on water and listed twelve degrees after running aground, but had been stabilized. Fifteen hours after the grounding, the ship sank.Cruise operator Louis Cruise Lines had announced earlier that all passengers and crew were accounted for. Officials are now reporting that two passengers are missing. A 45-year-old man, Jean-Christophe Allain, and his 16-year-old daughter, Maud, were reported missing by family members also on the cruise, according to a merchant marine ministry official.BBC journalist Malcolm Brabant reported that the missing passengers had been in a lower-deck cabin when the ship ran aground. Allain's wife and son escaped safely to the upper decks.Most of the passengers on board the Sea Diamond ship are either American or German. Local news reported that the ship is taking on water after striking a reef in the volcanic island's lagoon, similar to a lake, and issued a distress signal, launching an operation that led more than a dozen ships and five Greek Navy helicopters to evacuate all the people on board, with many boarding a small ferry.The ship was about one nautical mile - 1.8km - from the island's coast when it ran aground. The ship's operators, Louis Cruise Lines, earlier said that a "controlled evacuation" was underway, but that "there is no danger to passengers". The ship had left the Athenian port of Piraeus on Monday for a five-day tour of the islands. The sea was calm when the incident occurred."Some passengers have already reached the island and no-one has been hurt," an official at the Santorini coastguard has said, whilst Merchant Marine Minister Manolis Kefaloyiannis  said to reporters, "Thankfully, everything has gone well so far. Emergency services responded very quickly and very well."A CSX freight train traveling from Buffalo to Selkirk derailed in Oneida, New York. No injuries have yet been reported as a result of the accident.  It is not yet known what caused the accident; CSX and NTSB officials are investigating.Twenty six  of the train's 79 cars derailed around 7:00 a.m. local time; the derailment led to the explosion of at least one tank car carrying propane.  Two other cars are known to contain hazardous materials. As many as seven cars have been reported as burning. As a precaution, 23 miles (37 kilometers) of the adjacent Thruway have been closed between Syracuse and Verona. Authorities have ordered a complete evacuation for a one-mile radius around the derailment site, including a jail and two elementary schools.  Amtrak's Empire Service between Albany and Syracuse is suspended and Lake Shore Limited between Syracuse and Chicago is also affected; passengers on these routes are being bused around the affected area.At the time of the accident the train had a two-man crew and was traversing a section of track that has a 60 mile per hour (MPH) speed limit.  The train crew were not injured; it is not yet known what speed the train was traveling when the accident occurred.Pedro Pablo Perez, a Cuban cyclist who had qualified for the Olympics in Beijing, will miss the event after a car crash left him in a coma with brain trauma.Perez is receiving treatment at the Abel Santamaria hospital, in the province of Pinar del Rio where the accident took place. Details are unclear, but it is known Perez was driving the car at the time when the crash occurred in San Cristobal. It has not been reported by Cuban media if anyone else was in the car, or if other vehicles were involved, but it is known his wife, 2004 world scratch cycling champion Yoanka Gonzalez, was not present. He received "cerebral ... lacerations and remains in a coma" according to state newspaper Granma.Perez, 31, has won the Tour of Cuba five times, competed in the 2000 Sydney Games and received medals at the 1999 and 2003 Pan American Games.The Cutty Sark, one of the most famous historic sailing ships in the world, was seriously damaged by fire in the early hours of Monday morning, May 21, 2007. The 19th century ship, which is in dry dock in Greenwich, London, England, set a speed record during its working days, and has been a popular tourist attraction for many years.The fire brigade was first called to the blaze on the tea clipper at 4:45 a.m. BST and reported that the flames had been extinguished by 7:00 a.m., but firefighters were still on the scene damping down at 8.30 a.m. The blaze was so intense that eight fire engines and 40 firefighters were sent to put out the fire. No injuries have been reported. Cutty Sark Trust chief executive Richard Doughty said he was told the blaze was being treated as suspicious. "We're losing history," he lamented. "It's unbelievable." He went on: "When you lose the original fabric, you lose the touch of the craftsmen; you lose history itself. What is special about Cutty Sark is the timber, the iron frames, that went to the South China Sea. To think that is threatened in any way is unbelievable. It is an unimaginable shock." However, Doughty also confirmed that half of the ship's planking, and all of the masts and rigging had been removed for renovations prior to the fire. The iron framework of the hull has been twisted and buckled.The Chairman of Cutty Sark Enterprises, Chris Levitt, speaking later at the scene, said: "We had removed 50% of the planking, so 50% of the planking wasn't on site and that's safe and secure, and from where I stand there is not a huge amount of damage to the planking that was left on. There are pockets of charred planking and some have gone, but it doesn't look as bad as first envisaged."Cutty Sark Trust curatorial consultant, Dr Eric Kentley was optimistic that the Ship is not completely devastated and can be saved. Speaking about the Cutty Sark, he said: "We will put her back together - but it's going to take much much longer and a lot more money than we originally thought." The historic ship, one of London's best known tourist attractions, has been in dry-dock in Greenwich since 1954. It is currently undergoing a £25 million renovation scheduled to last until 2009. It was feared that gas canisters used in the reconstruction work might explode in the blaze but the London Fire Brigade later confirmed that none were present, although concerns about the risk of explosion had caused some delay in tackling the fire. It is a Grade I listed monument and is on the Buildings At Risk Register in the UK.A 78-year-old male cyclist died yesterday after being hit by a car in the Scottish capital Edinburgh. The accident occurred when the car hit the cyclist on the B800 road at approximately 1000 UTC yesterday.The driver of the car, a black Mercedes-Benz B-Class vehicle, was not injured in the incident and has reportedly been cooperating with police as they investigate. During inquiries the road on which the accident occurred, which connects Kirkliston and South Queensferry, was closed.In appealing to witnesses, Sergeant Ross Drummond of Police Scotland said the force has yet to track down any witnesses to the incident. "I am appealing for anyone who saw either the man on his bike — he was wearing every day clothing and was not in specialised cycling clothes — or the car around this time," Sergeant Drummond said.At least one person is dead and many more are missing as Cyclone Giri made landfall in Myanmar at around 8:00 pm local time (0130 UTC), according to officials. Giri strengthened just before making landfall in the capital of the Rakhine State, Sittwe, according to local media. An offical reported that a woman was killed in Minpyar when a tree collapsed, but he had not heard of anymore deaths yet. It was also reported that 100 fishermen are missing after the storm caught them in the northeastern Bay of Bengal.The hardest hit area was the coastal town of Kyaukphyu, which suffered power loss and destruction of its seawall. A Red Cross worker reported that about 70% of the city had been destroyed and there were 60,000 people who were in need of help, however no deaths were reported. "Fishermen and people there have had time to move to safer places as disaster measures were already in place," he said. "Our office in Kyaukphyu was destroyed by a falling tree... we have had problems getting transport and the latest data but are trying to reach the affected areas as soon as possible."Giri also produced wave heights of 7 to 8 meters (23-26 feet) which forced residents of St Martin's island and Teknaf to move to shelters. According to a resident of Sittwe, "the authorities warned us with loudspeakers yesterday to prepare for the cyclone, so people had time to move safer places." The strongest winds moved through the area on Saturday afternoon and then moved northeastward through the center of the country. Department of Meteorology and Hydrology stated that Giri is expected to weaken to a moderate tropical storm as it moves further inland.Full Wikinews coverage of the 2010 hurricane seasonA cyclone struck coastal areas of Bangladesh and India, causing flooding. At least seventeen people have been killed as a result of the storm, and thousands have been left homeless.Winds reaching 100 kilometres per hour in Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal province, have uprooted trees and destroyed communication lines."The situation is very grave, countless families have been displaced, especially in the Sundarbans," said Kanti Ganguly, the state minister of the Sundarbans region of Western Bengal.Airport operations in Kolkata were stopped as a result of the inclement weather; several Kolkata-bound flights were diverted elsewhere, and flights scheduled to depart were cancelled.The India Meteorological Department has said that the cyclone will likely subside within 24 hours. “We expect the wind speed to peak in the next 24 hours. This isn’t an unusually strong cyclone and we don’t expect damage to be widespread,” said the department's director general, Ajith Tyagi.At least 31 people were killed by a cyclone in West Bengal, India, according to officials. The storm uprooted trees and destroyed several huts in the North Dinajpur district of the state.Civil defence Minister Srikumar Mukherjee reported that the storm hit the state late Tuesday in the North Dinajpur district of West Bengal. The storm snapped telephone and electric wires in the area. Mukherjee added that hundreds of people suffered injuries in the district, which is nearly 315 miles (500 kilometers) northeast of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal. Hematabad, Raiganj and Kiran Dighi were the worst affected; police and rescue officials have recovered the bodies of 31 people from the areas, he told to the Associated Press. 50,000 mud huts were destroyed by the storm.P.K. Dutta, the additional district magistrate, commented that the Karandighi block reported eighteen deaths, while eight people died in Raiganj during the storm that occurred at midnight. Three were killed at Hemtabad and two at Kaliaganj, he added. Two other blocks, namely Itahar and Chakulia, were partly affected. He expected the death toll to rise as information from all affected areas was not immediately available.Cyclone Laila packing winds of 110 kilometres per hour closed in on the east coast of India on Thursday as tens of thousands of people evacuated their homes, fearing major storm damage.Laila hit the state of Andhra Pradesh as heavy rain and strong gales battered the coast, state authorities said at least 30,000 people had been evacuated from low-lying areas. The armed forces were drafted in to help the evacuation efforts after Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, K. Rosaiah, called Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to request extra assistance.The Indian Meteorological Department graded the cyclone as "severe", and said it was due to hit land near the city of Machilipatnam after moving from its current position 100 kilometres (62 miles) off the coast in the Bay of Bengal.The department's latest warning said a "storm surge" of up to two metres above the regular tide was likely to inundate parts of Andhra Pradesh. It said large trees were likely to be uprooted, houses damaged and escape routes from the coast flooded. All fishermen were ordered to stay on shore due to "very rough" sea conditions, and the Asian Tribune said Reliance Industries had suspended crude oil and gas production in the Bay as a precaution.The agency said 40,000 people had been evacuated from hundreds of coastal villages, while some air flights and train services were also affected. State disaster officials said that besides existing cyclone shelters, schools and community halls were serving as relief camps to evacuees.Three people were killed when a shed collapsed during heavy winds in Andhra Pradesh, while a fisherman drowned in rough sea in neighbouring Tamil Nadu state. Local unconfirmed reports put the total death toll at between 14 and 17.India and Bangladesh are hit regularly by cyclones that develop in the Bay of Bengal, causing widespread damage to homes and fields. Last May, Cyclone Aila tore through southern Bangladesh killing 300 people and destroyed 4,000 kilometres of roads and river embankments, leading to major flooding.Cyclone Mick, the first storm of the 2009–10 South Pacific cyclone season, has left at least four people dead after battering Fiji on Monday.The storm inflicted widespread damage throughout the nation, although the island of Viti Levu bore the brunt of the impact. At the height of the storm, wind gusts of 110 km/h (70 mph) blew across the island. Mick forced thousands into shelters and cut power to a large portion of the country. It triggered severe flooding and uprooted countless trees, and some residents are still without power."There's a lot of damage," said Tim Sutton, a spokesman for UNICEF. "Lots of trees down, power lines down everywhere, all the roads around Viti Levu are still closed with flooding and landslides." He described the cyclone as "very vicious".Although the storm itself has been downgraded and has started to dissipate, officials say that the death toll could increase as contact is established with some of the smaller islands. However, advanced warnings likely reduced the number of fatalities. On a lighter note, an emergency group of surgeons delivered seven babies during the cyclone's onslaught.Tropical Cyclone Monica has missed Darwin, dissipating into a category one cyclone at 1030 AEST (0030 UTC). The cyclone was originally expected to hit Darwin as a category five, but lost power as it traveled across the Northern Territory, moving further south than anticipated. While this may bring relief to many residents fearing a return of the infamous Cyclone Tracy, authorities have warned that Monica still packs a punch and will bring 90 kph winds to the region. Northern Territory police commander, Bert Hofer, has advised residents to "stay where they are," for the time being. Australian airline Qantas is resuming its flights to Darwin as of 1945 AEST today. All ANZAC Day dawn services were cancelled in the Northern Territory's capital.According to a new report released jointly by the Government of the Myanmar, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United Nations (UN), the cost of providing aid and funding reconstruction after Cyclone Nargis will be US $1 billion over the next three years. ASEAN said in a press release that Cyclone Nargis was the "most devastating natural disaster in Myanmar’s history". They also say that the cyclone had a "similar scale of impact to that of the Indian Ocean Tsunami in Indonesia in 2004". 84,530 died in the cyclone and 53,836 remain missing.The study also reported that a high number of families are in need of shelter due to the destruction of their property by the cyclone. It says that 57% of people had their home completely destroyed by the cyclone, whilst only 2% of people had no damage to their home.On May 9, the United Nations requested $187 million in aid for Myanmar, but this figure has increased as the full extent of the damage has been revealed. The amount of donations were several times bigger than the requested amount. By 15 June, around 12 billion kyat, or two billion dollars in donations had already been received by the government of Myanmar, according to the report.Heavy rains started on Sunday early morning throughout most of southern Pakistan as Cyclone Phet approached landfall. At least 370 millimeters were reported by the meteorological office in the port city of Gwadar on Friday; 208 milimeters in Jiwani, 139 milimeters in Pasni, 63 milimeters in Turbat and 60 in Ormara.Heavy rains and thunderstorms hit southwestern Balochistan and parts of interior Sindh Saturday evening leaving thousands displaced and around 40 villages to be washed away by the heavy rains.The storm system has moved from Oman and is expected to reach Pakistan by Sunday evening. According to the Oman News Agency, at least twelve people have been killed in Oman alone.Powerful Cyclone Sidr battered Bangladesh, killing hundreds of people, though reports vary. Citing the local United News of Bangladesh, the Associated Press is reporting a death toll of 1,100. An evacuation of some 3 million was attempted before the storm made landfall. Anjana Pasricha reported from New Delhi for VOA News that, officials say advance preparation saved many lives, in a country accustomed to natural disasters.Officials say the cyclone crashed into the country's southern coast Thursday night with winds of up to 240 kilometers an hour, triggering huge waves. Many villages were devastated as the winds uprooted trees and flattened homes. Torrential rain and waves washed away crops. Officials say many of the victims were killed by falling trees or debris from collapsing homes.Shail Shrestha, program coordinator for the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Dhaka, said preliminary reports indicate that the devastation is widespread."Phone lines are cut and communication system is very much disrupted, said Shrestha. "Agriculture products are badly damaged and livestock are also badly damaged."The worst of the storm was over by early Friday. This made it possible for government and volunteer teams to dispatch relief teams carrying food, water, medicines, and tents for the people in the affected districts. Although the storm has caused considerable destruction, officials say a mass evacuation ordered in advance helped save many lives. Hundreds of thousands of coastal villagers were evacuated into government-built cyclone shelters and other buildings as the storm approached. The shelters were built after the low-lying country suffered massive casualties in previous cyclones. A storm that hit the country in 1970 killed about half a million people. Another cyclone in 1991 killed more than 130,000.Chittagong is one of the districts that lay in the path of the storm. A senior district official, Mokhlesur Rahman, says the region was spared large-scale casualties. "We did evacuate a lot of people into different cyclone shelters, some in educational institutions," said Rahman. "It was of much help, evacuation…. Now they are going back home."India's east coast was also bracing for the cyclone, but so far it has escaped the storm's fury. Authorities reported that several areas were hit by heavy rain, but there was little damage.This article is based on Powerful Cyclone Wreaks Havoc in Bangladesh by VOA News  which has a copyright policy compatible with our CC-BY 2.5. Specifically "Copyright status of work by the U.S. government"Millions of people were evacuated over the previous 48 hours as Category 5, Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Sidr prepared to smash into Bangladesh's shoreline with top winds reaching 240 k/h (149 miles per hour).  A senior official for the Bengali government, Ali Imam Majumder, said that they expected to evacuate around 3.2 million people in all, adding, "We have taken all precautions."Shahjahan Alam, an official with Bangladesh's Meteorological Department, said the cyclone's eye is expected to hit 85 miles southwest of capital city Dhaka later on Thursday.A court in Cyprus has begun the trial of defunct airline Helios and four managers over an air disaster in Greece. The five are facing a total of 1,190 charges after Flight 522 went down near Athens in 2005, killing 121 people.All defendants entered not guilty pleas, and are alleged by prosecutors to have operated their business in an unsafe manner. It is alleged that the flight should never have been allowed to take off. As well as the company, executive chairman Andreas Drakos, managing director Demetris Pantazis, operations manager George Kikkides and head pilot Ianko Stoimenov will face a full trial when proceedings are resumed on November 27. They will return to the Nicosia court then. The charges include manslaughter and causing death via a careless act.The unresponsive Boeing 737, supposed to be flying between Lanarca to Prague, had entered Greek airspace, where it was intercepted by two F-16 fighter jets on August 14, 2005.The F-16 pilots reported the airliner's pilots were slumped over the controls. After flying on autopilot for two hours the aircraft crashed near Athens despite the efforts of a flight attendant, who was training to become a pilot, to take control and save the jet.The subsequent investigation discovered that the pilots failed to adequately monitor the pressurisation system. The plane lost cabin pressure and hypoxia caused the incapacitation of the passengers and flight crew. It is thought that the conscious flight attendant had used multiple crew oxygen cylinders to outlast the others on board. Investigators also believe that the equipment had been left in the wrong setting after testing by maintenance engineers and never checked before flight.After failing to resuscitate the pilot-in-command, the trainee pilot turned off the autopilot and attempted an emergency landing at Athens International Airport, which the aircraft had been circling in a holding pattern awaiting human input. However, the aircraft ran out of fuel before reaching the runway.A two-year trial concluded yesterday in Cyprus with the court in Nicosia clearing former senior staff of Helios Airways of manslaughter. They, alongside the defunct airline, had been accused of responsibility for killing 119 in a crash near Athens.All 121 on board Flight 522 were killed but the prosecution did not charge manslaughter in relation to the two flight crew, deeming them partially responsible for their own deaths. The accident remains the worst air disaster to befall both Greece and Cyprus. Most victims were Cypriot tourists.The Cypriot jet left Larnaca on August 14, 2005. It was headed for Prague in the Czech Republic. Contact was quickly lost with the aircraft, which flew itself as far as the Greek capital on autopilot. The Boeing 737's pressurisation system is believed to have been incorrectly set by maintenance and oxygen starvation had knocked out German Captain Hans-Jurgen Merten and Cypriot co-pilot Pambos Charalambous. They never checked the system before takeoff, which had undergone testing prior to flight.An alarm had sounded both on the ground and in the air but had been ignored by those flying, as the same alarm was used for a different problem and the pilots therefore misinterpreted the alarm. This design would later be cited by victims' relatives in a civil case against Boeing.As the unresponsive jet entered Greek airspace two F-16 fighter jets intercepted. The air force reported back that the civilian craft's pilots were slumped over the controls. Passengers were similarly incapacitated. The plane reached Athens International Airport — an intermediate stop in Athens was planned — by itself and then began circling the area awaiting human input.That input eventually came in the form of a trainee pilot working on-board as a flight attendant. Investigators believe Andreas Prodromou had used multiple crew oxygen cylinders to be the last conscious person on board. The fighter pilots were able to watch him enter the cockpit. F-16 pilot Panayiotis Athanasopoulos was the last person to see Prodromou alive. He previously told the trial of initially receiving no response when signalling the jet in an attempt to get the pilots to follow him, then discovering the flight crew unconscious. The captain was out of sight. He testified he also signalled people wearing oxygen masks in the passenger cabin with similar lack of response. Prodromou, 25, entered the cockpit as the jet began losing altitude. After trying but failing to resuscitate Merten, the fighter pilots saw the trainee pilot take over the controls himself in a bid to save the plane. He was out of time. By then the aircraft had been in the air for two hours, and it ran out of fuel before it could reach the runway. Although many were deeply comatose from lack of oxygen, everyone on board was still alive when the plane crashed into a mountain at Grammatiko, north of Athens.Athanasopoulos says he gesticulated to Proprodomou and signalled him to land upon getting his attention. The trainee pilot simply pointed downwards, after which he "looked ahead and did not look towards me again as the plane went down". The airliner struck the ground levelly on its underside after straightening out moments before impact. It was torn apart.The following year saw an air accident report primarily citing human error, and an inquiry by ex-Judge Panayiotis Kallis. The Kallis report was never made public. Helios, which was renamed Ajet Airways, closed down in 2006. Helios and Boeing were sued by victims' relatives; they sought €76 million but reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum. The accident report had also blamed Boeing for an "ineffectiveness of measures" over the dual-purpose alarm system.The five defendants were charged in 2008. The defunct airline and four senior staff members each faced 119 counts of manslaughter, and alternative counts of causing death by a reckless, thoughtless or dangerous act. This gave a total of 1,190 charges. Manslaughter carries a potential life sentence with up to four years available on the lesser charge. "The charges concern two of the three most serious offences under the Cyprus penal code," deputy attorney general Akis Papasavvas said at the time.The prosecution case was that the pilots were unfit to fly and the defendants were negligent in letting them at the controls. The state prosecutor therefore needed to prove the actions of Merten and Charalambous caused the disaster, as well as that those in the dock were responsible for their employment and aware — or ought to have been aware — of inadequacies in their competence.The prosecution had noted the accused failed to seek references from Jet2, Merten's last employer. He lost that job owing to failings in his duties and was later the subject of Helios co-pilots' complaints. Charalambous was considered unlikely to achieve promotion to pilot and his ability to handle stress was questioned at trial.In reaching a majority decision, two of the three judges noted Helios chief executive Andreas Drakos and managing director Demetris Pantazis would be acquitted even if the prosecution proved its case as they were not responsible for employing the pair. This fell to co-accused operations manager George Kikkides and chief pilot Ianko Stoimenov.In any event, the verdict described "a dead-end for any procedure of identifying the competence of Merten" with only Jet2 among his previous employers being known to have a negative view of him. Subsequent official evaluations rated both him and Charalambous suitably competent to fly."The lack of any causal association between the defendants and the negligence they were charged with for the fatal accident completely disconnects the defendants with the accident," said the 170-page verdict. "Regardless... [of] how the charges are viewed, they remain groundless and without supporting evidence. It's judged that this reason is sufficient to dismiss all charges and acquit all defendants." Assize Court President Charis Solomonides read the decision: "we conclude, without reservation, that no case has been proven prima-facie against all the defendants in all the charges they face and therefore, all the defendants are acquitted and charges are dropped." Solomonides made repeated mention of an inability for the prosecution to link the pilots' actions to those on trial, and noted that therefore no assessment had been made of their performance that day.Judge Nicolas Santis dissented. Nonetheless, he too had criticisms of the prosecution. He said they failed to properly define 'competence' and called very few experts to testify. Victims' relatives shouted in the courtroom after he finished reading his opinion; cries included "killers!" and "is this justice?".Victims' relatives had in fact predicted the acquittal and blamed the state for what they characterised as a poorly presented case. Relatives’ Committee president Nicolas Yiasoumis said "It was common knowledge that proceedings were weak due to the phrasing of the charges." There were also renewed calls for publication of the Kallis report. Yiasoumis claimed the Kallis report reached different conclusions to those used at trial, and said "We did not believe they could be convicted on the basis of the argument that they had not employed the appropriate staff."Attorney General Petros Clerides initially said an appeal will be decided upon once the decision has been read, and that the Law Office was presently studying it. Yiasoumis said relatives may take Cyprus to a European court over the case once Cypriot legal matters are concluded. Clerides has now confirmed an appeal will be filed, which the prosecution has two weeks to do. He defended the performance of those who prosecuted "this titanic case". The appeal would be to the Supreme Court.A Helios airliner (Boeing 737, flight HCY 522) with 115 passengers and 6 crew onboard has crashed into a mountain at 09:04 UTC (12:04 p.m. EEST) near Grammatiko, 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of Athens, while approaching the capital's airport. All on board perished. The plane was travelling from Larnaca, in the southeast of Cyprus (Greek:Kypros, Κύπρος) and scheduled to arrive in Prague after a stop in Athens.Cypriot prosecutors have charged five people over the 2005 crash of Helios Airways Flight 522. The loss of the Boeing 737 killed all 121 people on board in what was the deadliest air disaster for both Greece and Cyprus."The charge sheet was submitted to the court [in Nicosia] today [Tuesday], and a response to the charges has been set for February 26," said deputy attorney general Akis Papasavvas. The names of those charged were not released, and they face charges of manslaughter and causing death by a reckless, thoughtless or dangerous act, which carry life and four year terms respectively. They all worked for Helios."The charges concern two of the three most serious offences under the Cyprus penal code," said Papasavvas. Families of the victims, who had already called for criminal prosecutions, are still carrying out a civil action against the Cypriot civil aviation authority and airframer Boeing. Helios closed in 2006, having been renamed Ajet Airways.The unresponsive aircraft, supposed to be flying between Lanarca to Prague, entered Greek airspace, where it was intercepted by two F-16 fighter jets on August 14, 2005.The F-16 pilots reported the airliner's pilots were slumped over the controls.

The loss of the Boeing 737 killed all 121 people on board.Attorney General Petros Clerides announced the plans today, but did not indicate who was to be charged or exactly what the offenses were."We came to the conclusion that, from the evidence gathered, a criminal prosecution is justified against several people whom we consider accountable for the plane crash," he said at a press conference in Nicosia.The unresponsive aircraft, supposed to be flying between Lanarca to Prague, entered Greek airspace where it was intercepted by two F-16 fighter jets on August 14, 2005.The F-16 pilots reported the airliner's pilots were slumped over the controls.

The incident occurred near Ústí nad Labem in the north of the country.As a result of the crash, the train was seriously damaged. At least six people were injured with wounds of varying seriousness, all of which were hospitalised; conflicting media reports, however, suggested that the number of hurt passengers was substantially more. According to Czech media, the dead man was the train's driver.According to the press-secretary of the local fire department, the train went off the rails a few hundred metres from the station.Preliminary investigation has revealed that the train derailed when crossing a railroad switch 58 km/h faster than authorized.  The safe speed limit is 120 km/h when the switch, also known as a turnout or a set of points, is set to a straight path, and 50 km/h when the switch is set to divert the train to another track.  In this case, the switch was set to divert, but the train's speed is reported to have been 108 km/h.The accident happened on one of the most important railroads in the country, which is double-tracked, electrified and used daily by long-distance international trains.  Therefore it is checked often, and investigators consider track failure to be improbable. Investigators have ruled out signal malfunction. Media reports suggest two possible reasons for the derailment: driver's error or brake malfunction.Train operations on the line from Ústí nad Labem to the capital Prague had to be cancelled as a result of the crash.On Friday, a dam burst in a southwestern suburb of Jakarta, Indonesia, killing at least 52 people and displacing a further 1,490. Officials, however, warn that the death toll will likely increase.The cause of the accident appears to be due to heavy rains that night, which overfilled the Situ Gintung lake behind the broken dam. "The dam was an old dam, 16 metres deep. Last night, because of heavy rain, the dam could not hold back the water so it broke," said the governor of the Banten province, Ratu Atut Chosiyah.The breach occurred at approximately 02:00 local time (UTC+7), when many people were in bed, asleep. "People were still sleeping and couldn't do anything. Many people are still trapped and the rescue is ongoing," a local official said to Agence France-Presse.Rescue efforts were hampered due to a deluge of mud and debris from the dam. "We're still trying to get into the houses, but the problem is, mud is getting in our way," social affairs spokesman Mardjito said.The President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, offered his condolences to the victims of the disaster. "On behalf of the government, I express my condolences to the families of the dead victims and may their souls be accepted by God almighty," he said.Indonesia's Vice President Yusuf Kalla has visited the scene of the incident. "We will provide emergency help to the victims. For those whose homes were destroyed, the government will help with the repairs," he told Metro TV.A major concern following this flood is the risk of water-borne diseases such as malaria. These problems are made worse by the local climate being very hot and humid.The Situ Gintung dam was built early last century, during the Dutch colonial rule. It was holding back a lake of about two million cubic metres (70 million cubic feet) of water.A bladder holding 10,000 megalitres of water at the Bedford Weir near Blackwater, Queensland has burst, sending flood waters rushing into the Fitzroy River towards the barrage near Rockhampton. It is believed up to four people who were in the vicinity of the dam before the breach may be missing.An urgent flash flood warning was issued at 5:40 p.m. AEST (0740 UTC) following the breach. A wall of water was seen rushing downstream, leaving several people clinging to trees. The water was expected to travel quickly and cause flash flooding at river crossings and bridges along the river.The mayor of the Central Highlands Regional Council, Peter McGuire, said the break was a "disaster". "There are reports of people missing," he said. "I've heard three and four [people are missing] but I don't know if that's right."He added that the dam holds 22,900 megalitres of water and that a bladder on top of the dam's concrete wall had burst.Emergency services are at the scene, searching the riverbanks. A Queensland Police spokeswoman said a rescue helicopter was only on the way to the area to "cover all bases", but claimed to know nothing of the missing people, although rescue teams were being organised at the scene.An offshore earthquake shook buildings in Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory today, and an earthquake with a magnitude of at least 6.2 struck off the coast of Sumatra yesterday, triggering a tsunami alert.Geoscience Australia says the offshore quake registered 5.3 on the Richter scale. No damage has been reported in the city of Darwin or the community of Port Keats which is the nearest town to the quake's epicentre in a region known for its moderate seismicity. The quake's epicentre was located 500 kilometres west-north-west of Darwin in the Banda Sea. The earthquake hit at 9.51am (CDT).Geoscience Australia (the government's geological organisation) says the region may be unstable for a few days and aftershocks or another quake may be felt. Duty seismologist, Dr Svetan Sinadinovski, says it was a shallow quake and the subterranean make-up of the area allowed the tremor waves to travel to Darwin without losing much energy. He says the quake was on Australia's continental shelf, which is a common place for seismic activity."That is the area where Australian plate collides with Asian plate and that extends through the Indonesian islands up to Sumatra and Thailand in the north and east through PNG to Tonga and New Zealand," he said. "Preliminary reports point to a 5 to 6 in the Darwin region - this means that the earthquake would have been felt by almost everyone indoors according to the Modified Mercali Scale which measures the impact of seismic waves on structures.""People would have felt this earthquake up to 500km away from the epicentre, and we have heard numerous reports of residents in the Darwin area having felt the effects of the event," he said.Among those who felt the quake were participants involved in the trial of Bradley John Murdoch in the Northern Territory Supreme Court in Darwin -  where chairs and TVs shook in the court building. The Bureau of Meteorology's Darwin office was also shaken, but no reports of damage have been received by police."We felt it - I felt the building sway and some of the monitors shook a little," the bureau's duty forecaster, Billy Lynch, said. "We are on the third floor of a three-story building."Nicole John, the daughter of Eric John, the current US ambassador to Thailand, has died after falling from an apartment building in New York City. Nicole John, 17, fell to her death from the top floor of the Herald Towers, a 25-storey building. She was attending a party and had been believed to have been drinking. Police said that it is suspected that she had climbed out of the window ledge to take a picture when she slipped and fell.John's death has been ruled as an accident but  25-year old Ilan Nassimi, the tenant of the room she fell from has been arrested on charges of giving alcohol to a minor. John had been clubbing with friends before she arrived at Nassimi's party. She was using a fake identification card which stated her age at either 23 or 24.A spokesman for the Tenjune club John was at earlier in the night confirmed that security did check her I.D. He said "The technology can be so good that people are developing ways to sneak into places every day," said a source close to the club. "There are some [fake IDs] that are uncatchable."Nassimi defends his innocence saying that he was unaware that John was under 21. He told police that he met her in a club and expressed to several people his interest in hosting an after party.Marussia F1's test driver María de Villota is conscious and "talking with her family", according to the team's principal, John Booth. The Spaniard has been in hospital since her collision with one of the team's support vehicles on Tuesday.De Villota has had two operations since her accident. After the first, overnight on Tuesday at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, it was reported in a press release by Marussia that she had lost her right eye, and was still in a "critical but stable" condition. On Friday, she underwent a second operation, according to Marussia, "a planned procedure that would depend upon the continued stability of Maria’s head injuries, and this morning the medical team were sufficiently happy with her progress to allow the operation to go ahead." Subsequent to the operation, her condition was upgraded to "serious but stable".Her sister, Isabel de Villota, has thanked both F1 fans and drivers for their response, saying "We remain positive and this is due, in no small part, to the overwhelming expression of love for Maria from every corner of the world." Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso was among those expressing his support, dedicating his pole postion in Saturday's qualifying to De Villota.Regarding the accident itself, F1 Race Director Charlie Whiting is of the opinion that it was a "one-in-five-million" fluke. Despite questions being raised, both about De Villota's experience and the positioning of the truck with which she collided, he has described it as "so unique that it was just incredible bad luck".The body of Mike Seavers, a mountaineer who died in a climbing accident in the French Alps, has been found after seventeen years.The 31 year-old, who lived in Bristol, was scaling Mont Blanc with a climbing party when they got caught up in a fierce storm. He was found alongside a German member of the party in a melting glacier which preserved their bodies, according to Nick Cotton from the British Mountaineering Council. “They may have gone inside a crevasse to take cover and got covered, possibly by an avalanche or snowfall. Glaciers are flowing things. They move at an imperceptible speed and anything travels with it encased in ice. When they get to a point where the glacier melts, things appear,” he said.The fire that broke out in a Parisian building that housed black immigrants may have been caused by criminals who committed arson, authorities announced. Activist groups denounce housing and immigration policies.In the night of August 25 to August 26, a fire broke out a run-down apartment building located at 20, Bd Vincent Auriol in Paris, France. The building housed a number of immigrant families from Africa. These families had squatted the building illegally, until the building was bought by the local government and ran through some charity; even then, the building did not respect applicable safety norms.Experts have examined the situation. While no hydrocarbons (fuel etc.) were found on the scene, the speed of the fire seems to indicate a criminal origin. For this reason, the prosecution service of Paris (parquet) opened a criminal investigation for "arson resulting in death". An investigating magistrate has been named. Criminals face a maximal penalty of life imprisonment, though lesser criminal qualifications may be retained during the course of the enquiry.On Saturday 4, protests were staged denouncing the recent fires that killed black immigrant families housed in unsafe buildings. Left-wing groups such as the Revolutionary Communist League denounced the immigration, workforce and housing policies of the center-right government, as well as its center-left predecessor, as regressive and promoting racism.Stunt pilot and Marine veteran Jim LeRoy, age 46, died on Saturday, 28 July 2007 at the Dayton Air Show in Ohio, United States, while performing in his signature S2S Bulldog Pitts aircraft, with his companion pilot in a stunt routine. The two planes executed a looping cross near to the ground, but while LeRoy's companion pulled up, LeRoy's Bulldog never did, hitting the ground and skidding to a stop, engulfed in flames.After airport fire trucks put out the blaze, LeRoy was airlifted out of the crash site by a Black Hawk helicopter, which had been on medical standby for the show. After the crash, the air show's announcer (also a pastor) led the crowd in a prayer for Jim's survival and healing. LeRoy died while the helicopter was making its way to Miami Valley Hospital.The portion of the show was just prior to when the Thunderbirds would have flown, who stepped down to allow airport security and the TSA and FAA to conduct their investigation. Videos of the crash were requested by the agencies. The show was then closed for the day, to allow the investigation to continue, and airport police stood by to "remove cars as fast as possible."On Saturday, the Trump Tower, in Midtown, New York City, caught fire shortly before 18:00 EST (2200 UTC) on the 50th floor, claiming the life of a 67-year-old resident, Todd Brassner, who lived in apartment 50C. All other residents were evacuated without incident. During the fire, six firefighters received non-life-threatening burns and other minor injuries. Neither US President Donald Trump nor the First Family were in the building at the time of the fire.The high-end Fifth Avenue address is the personal residence of President Donald Trump, whose family occupies the top three stories of the 58-story building. The US Secret Service maintains a constant security presence inside the building with the New York City Police Department guarding a hard perimeter, intended to stop vehicular attacks, and a soft perimeter, intended for on-foot attacks.The four-alarm fire required 200 firemen, extra police, and paramedics. At 20:00 EST (0000 UTC Sunday), the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) declared the fire was under control. Trump tweeted, "Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!" This is the second fire at Trump Tower since the election; previously on January 8, a fire was caused by an electrical malfunction in a cooling tower on the roof. Three FDNY firefighters received minor injuries, and all residents and office workers evacuated without incident on that occasion.Trump Tower provides a number of unique problems never before encountered by the Secret Service. Never has a US President's personal residence been inside a skyscraper or in a densely populated area like Midtown. The security measures have disrupted vehicular and pedestrian traffic requiring time consuming detours and delaying emergency response.The New York Fire Code did not mandate sprinkler systems at the time Trump Tower was built in 1983, which might have reduced the size and severity of the fire had they been present. The 50th-floor apartment was, according to FDNY Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro, "[T]he apartment was virtually, entirely on fire." The Secret Service monitors all the fire alarms in the building but it took time to find the source of the thick black smoke emanating from the fire. Secret Service Agents escorted the firefighters throughout the building, including the Trump residence.Brassner, the sole casualty, was unconscious when firefighters pulled him out of apartment 50C. He was transported to Mount Sinai Roosevelt Hospital. Originally listed as critical, he was pronounced dead sometime during the night. Brassner, guitar collector, was acquainted with artist Andy Warhol and was acknowledged in Warhol's 1989 autobiography, The Andy Warhol Diaries. The cause of the fire is unknown, with investigations into Brassner's death and the emergency response ongoing. Currently, the Secret Service leads the investigation.Heavy overnight rains flooded Istanbul, Turkey, stranding motorists and flooding arterial roads. The floods led to the death of at least 31 people and the cost of damage has been estimated as being in excess of $70 million in northwestern parts of the country.The flood devastated businesses, swept away cars and swamped houses, roads, and farming land. Fueled by the worst rain in 80 years, waters rose up to six feet (2 meters) high in the city's İkitelli district, cutting off the route to Istanbul's main airport and the highway to Greece and Bulgaria on the European side of the sprawling city."We are saddened by the loss of lives. There are still some people missing and we are searching for them," said Mustafa Demir, the Turkish Procurement Minister, as quoted by the Associated Press news agency.Over 1000 people have been rescued by emergency services, including military helicopters, since the floods began on Tuesday.The worst flooding in 80 years in Pakistan has left at least 800 people dead, and affected over a million more. The floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains and have destroyed homes in the country, especially in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.The Pakistan Meteorological Department said that twelve inches of rain fell over a 36 hour period. Sohail Rahman, reporting for Al Jazeera from Pakistan's capital of Islamabad, said that Islamabad experienced a "deluge of water" flowing south from Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. He went on to say that "floods have really affected the infrastructure in and around the province. The people in the affected areas were quite critical in the first 24 hours, saying that the authorities were not doing enough."Rescue operations have been hampered by the weather; while seventeen helicopters are operating, with more to come, they cannot operate in all areas due to the weather, and just 48 boats are available for use by rescue crews.Earlier this week, bad weather shrouded Islamabad when a passenger plane crashed, killing all 152 on board.A deadly forest fire in Spain's Guadalajara province has claimed the lives of at least 11 fire fighters. The fire began after a group of day trippers in Cueva de los Casares on Saturday left a barbeque unextinguished -- the day trippers have since confessed to causing the fire. At least 11,000 acres have been affected by the fire thus far.The 11 firefighters, both men and women in their 20s, were trapped in their vehicle after a change in wind direction caused their vehicle to be encircled with flames. More than 150 firefighters have battled the blaze since Sunday. Water planes and helicopters from the region are assisting in the effort to extinguish the blaze; two French firefighting aircraft have been sent to augment Spanish forces.Spain suffers on average 20,000 wild fires each year -- a heat wave and lack of rain have contributed to the tinder-box conditions which have exacerbated the fire season this year.So far at least 15 people have died in a major ice storm in the United States which has left more than 600,000 residents and businesses across three states, without electricity. Officials for the utility companies say that this could be the worst ice storm in history."This particular storm is now the worst in company history in terms of customers affected," said Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokesman, Brian Alford.The National Weather Service (NWS) has ice storm warnings still in effect for Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois where as much as one inch of ice can accumulate on outdoor surfaces.A State of Emergency has already been declared in Missouri with Governor Matt Blunt saying "we are only just beginning to see the devastation from this series of storms." Bowling Green has already seen nearly two to three inches of ice since Saturday December 8. Most other areas of Missouri have received 1/2 inch to one inch of ice.Illinois has also seen accumulation, with the greatest total of one inch received in Poplar Grove.Edna, Columbus, Pittsburg, Independence and Hutchinson, Kansas have all received at least one inch of ice along with parts of Texas and Oklahoma.The NWS says that more storms are on the way and more ice is likely across the same regions."A series of low pressure centers have brought ice and snow from the Rockies, Southern Plains, to the Midwest and portions of the Northeast. Several additional disturbances and the presence of shallow Arctic air will continue to bring bouts of freezing rain, sleet, and snow from the Southwest to the Plains States, Midwest, and Northeast over the next several days," said a statement on the NWS's website.A deadly earthquake has hit the Balochistan region of south western Pakistan. The magnitude 6.4 quake struck approximately 70km north of Quetta at 04:09 local time (23:09 UTC), and had a depth of 10km.Government officials have reported that many houses collapsed due to both the earthquake and the landslides that it spawned.  More than 160 people have been reported killed so far, with at least 200 injured. It is expected that the death toll will rise as the rescue and recovery continues.According to officials the worst struck areas are: Ziarat, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Chaman, Loralai,Sibbi, and Mastung.Seventy-three years ago Quetta was almost completely destroyed in an earthquake, and death toll was about 35,000 people. In October 2005, during the holy month of Ramadan, more than 75,000 people were killed in an earthquake in north-west Pakistan, and around 100,000 people wounded. More then half a million people lost their homes.At least 39 people are confirmed dead, dozens injured and numerous buildings are left damaged in several states after series of tornadoes hit the U.S. Midwest March 2. The storm system stretched from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes. Southern Indiana, northern Alabama and parts of Kentucky and Tennessee were affected the most. The first warning went out around 9:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time and by about 1:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, at least twelve tornadoes had touched down in three different states. At least fourteen people were confirmed dead in Indiana. Officials are still trying to determine how many people might have died and assessing the damage. New Pekin, Indiana, Marysville and Henryville are reported to have been hit the worst. Marysville about a hour north of Louisville, Kentucky has been reported to be nearly flatted. In Kentucky, at least 17 people had died and at least 200 injuries have been reported. Only one has been confirmed dead in Alabama but at least eleven people were injured during the storm. There are three confirmed dead in Clermont County, Ohio.Damage reports in the Midwest and South keep piling up. Golf ball, tennis ball and softball size hail was reported in several states. Severe damage was reported in Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville after high winds and 3 inch in diameter hail tore through the cities. At the Limestone Correctional Facility in northern Alabama roofs were ripped off two dormitories housing over 500 inmates and multiple security fences were knocked down. Even though the prison lost power, nobody was injured or escaped. Also, flights were delayed for over an hour after storm debris littered the runways at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.The National Weather Service issued 255 tornado warnings on Friday, received 94 reports of tornadoes, 208 reports of strong winds and 410 reports of hail. The storms, caused by a warm, moist and unseasonable air mass that then mixed with colder air, followed a series of tornadoes earlier in the week that killed 13 people in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee. The storms have raised fear that 2012 will be another bad year for tornadoes. Last year was the deadliest year in a century due to tornadoes, killing 550 people.A huge thunderstorm system  spawning massive tornadoes ripped  through the south-eastern  US  Wednesday evening and early Thursday morning, killing at least 306 people in six states and causing  wide spread property damage.  Some 173 tornadoes have been reported from New York to Texas.  In the worst hit state of  Alabama, at least 210 are confirmed  dead, including 36 in Tuscaloosa alone.Deaths also were reported in  Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia and  Kentucky. Up to  one million people in Alabama were without power.  A nuclear power plant was shut down in Alabama after it lost power to its three units, an operation of  the plant's safety systems.Seven states have declared a state of emergency, and federal aid  is being sent to Alabama. Governor  Robert J. Bentley said he was activating  2,000 Alabama National Guard personell to  aid in  search and rescue. President Barack Obama, who plans to visit Alabama on Friday to view the destruction,  sent a message of condolence to the governor:"Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives because of the tornadoes that have swept through Alabama and the southeastern United States. Our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by this devastation, and we commend the heroic efforts of those who have been working tirelessly to respond to this disaster. I just spoke to Governor Bentley and told him that I have ordered the Federal Government to move quickly in our response and informed him that I approved his request for emergency Federal assistance, including search and rescue assets. While we may not know the extent of the damage for days, we will continue to monitor these severe storms across the country and stand ready to continue to help the people of Alabama and all citizens affected by these storms."Preliminary estimates of the tornado hitting  Tuscaloosa suggest it tore along the ground for 176 miles and contained  winds up to 200 miles per hour. The devastation included residential and commercial areas, as well as  the city's  infrastructure and civic buildings."I don't know how anyone survived," said  Mayor Walter Maddox of Tuscaloosa. "We're used to tornadoes here in Tuscaloosa. It's part of growing up. But when you look at the path of destruction that's likely 5 to 7 miles long in an area half a mile to a mile wide ... it's an amazing scene. There's parts of the city I don't recognize, and that's someone that's lived here his entire life."Officials did not want to give specific numbers for death toll and destruction  in specific states, as the extent of the damage and human injury and death is not completely known.  According the the Los Angeles Times, "Mississippi officials reported 32 dead, Tennessee raised its report to 29, Georgia reported 13, Virginia said it had eight deaths and Kentucky reported at least one death. The number of injured was in the hundreds, with that number also expected to rise.""In terms of the ground-up damage and quite possibly the insured damage, this event will be of historic proportions," Jose Miranda, from EQECAT, a catastrophe risk modeling firm,The severe weather warning has been  continued through Thursday, and includes  parts of New York, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. This  outbreak of tornadoes is considered the deadliness since 1974 when more than 300 were killed in a tornado outbreak. On March 18, 1925,  695 people died in a storm. Greg Carbin,  meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said, "May is usually the most active tornado month. Will it maintain the activity of April, we just cannot say."Typhoon Cimaron, known to those in the Philippines as Typhoon Paeng, made landfall on October 29 in Luzon at around 1:00 UTC. Winds of 160 mph were sustained for one minute, were recorded shortly before landfall. Already, it has killed at least nineteen people, injured 58, and at least fifteen people may still be missing in the Philippines. Damage in the country is estimated to have reached $443 million pesos, or $8.8 million United States dollars (USD).On Thursday, the Sri Lankan government reported more than 202 people were killed due to the torrential heavy rains caused by cyclone Mora over the last few days. Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Rathnapura, Colombo districts were mainly affected due to the heavy rains. According to the figures reported by the Disaster Management Center (DMC) issued on Wednesday, at least 202 people have been confirmed dead while about 99 people were missing and 122 injured. The report said about 1505 houses were destroyed and more than 7600 houses were damaged. More than 629,742 were affected and several people have been displaced to safe places, DMC stated. Sixteen countries including India, Russia, the US had offered food and relief medicines, Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday. On Monday, Red Cross said this was Sri Lanka's worst floods since 2003. Police said the Panapitiya Bolgoda dam could collapse due to the heavy rains.The death toll from the weekend suspension bridge collapse on the Indonesian island of Borneo has risen from four to eleven. Search and rescue teams continue to look for bodies in the Mahakam River.The number of wounded is currently 39 injured; reports from locals suggest 33 people remain missing at the scene in East Kalimantan's Kutai Kartanegara district, where "Kalimantan's Golden Gate Bridge" linked the towns of Tenggarong and the regional capital, Samarinda. A six-month-old baby is among the dead.Cars, motorbikes, and buses all fell into the Mahakam River when the bridge came down during repairs. Another car was left overturned and balanced upon wreckage over the water. State-owned builders PT Hutama Karya completed the bridge about a decade ago in the image of California's Golden Gate Bridge. A cable on the 720-metre structure is thought to have failed as workers dealt with it; six of the repair crew were reported missing yesterday. It had been the longest suspension bridge in Borneo.Eyewitnesses described heavy traffic at the time of the collapse, and one survivor said he left his truck to investigate a traffic jam. Some people were left trapped by debris as the bridge came down. "It happened so fast, only about 30 seconds," according to National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Nugoroho.National search and rescue head Daryatmo said yesterday cranes will attempt to move debris today, with new reports saying echo-sounding equipment will be used to check it is safe to begin lifting. It is believed the bodies of more victims will be found trapped in vehicles beneath the water, which is 35-40 metres deep. Visibility is poor, and one official explained authorities are still unsure how many vehicles are on the riverbed."The above-water search is continuing, but underwater operations have not been carried out because we're worried that the bridge's pylons are unstable and could collapse any time," said Nugoroho today. He explained that bodies had washed onto the riverbanks overnight and were recovered today.The president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has sent three ministers to the site to investigate the accident, while Bambang Widaryatmo, head of East Kalimantan's police, promised "parties found to be negligent will be prosecuted". The government has promised a replacement ferry service. The river is closed to boats as rescue operations continue, and a 22-strong team has been dispatched from the national police, comprising six forensics experts, five disaster victim identification specialists, and eleven investigators. They are there to augment the East Kalimantan Police. Health Minister Endang Rahayu Sedyaningsih yesterday visited survivors in Parikesit Hospital and promised them medical treatment at government expense.Some people swam ashore after falling, with the aftermath filled with screams.  Survivor Syakrani, 24, yesterday asserted "The authorities should have closed the bridge if it was under repair." His words were followed by a Jakarta Globe editorial declaring the accident "unacceptable".The Globe went on to comment upon suggestions corruption may have played a role; "It is too early to point fingers and look to place blame, but if shoddy materials were used in the building of the bridge, those responsible must answer to the public." Another suggestion is coal barges striking the bridge may have weakened it. Local coal company Harum Energy lost five percent of its share value today amid fears the river blockage will hamper their ability to ship coal.Samarinda's seen a population and construction boom lately. A few years have seen the population triple and the construction of a large mosque, and a sports stadium; an airport and port are set to follow. However, the Corruption Eradication Commission warns 70% of the corruption it investigates concerns government contracts and up to 40% of money earmarked for infrastructure ends up stolen.At least sixty people have been confirmed dead after mudslides in southeastern Brazil, mostly on Ilha Grande, caused by torrential rainfall.Rescue efforts are still continuing in the state of Rio de Janeiro for people feared to be buried under houses, which collapsed due to the deluge of mud and rain. Rescuers used shovels and heavy machinery to dig through the rubble.Colonel Jerri Andrade, who is supervising the rescuers, commented on the current status of rescue efforts. "The weather is improving, which helps us with the search, but we won't rest as long as we suspect that there are more bodies underneath the remains."More rain is forecast in the days ahead, making additional mudslides a possibility. The authorities have warned that the death toll could increase as more bodies are found. Three days of mourning were declared in the Rio de Janeiro greater area, and celebrations scheduled for January 6 were called off.At least 65 people have been killed and 9,900 houses destroyed in southern China after torrential rainstorms hit the area over the past week.Fourteen people are missing, and 2.55 million people have been affected by the rains; flash floods breached dikes, exacerbating the situation. Among the cities struck were Congqing, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Jiangxi.The inclement weather is expected to continue in Hunan and Jiangxi, according to meteorologists. According to the state news agency, Xinhua, as much as 157 millimetres of rain fell throughout the region from Wednesday evening to Thursday afternoon.The rains started when a heat wave in the southern part of the country mingled with a cold front from the north, according to reports citing weather forecasters.The death toll from a 6.9 magnitude earthquake in the Qinghai province in western China has surpassed two thousand.The official number of dead is now at 2,039, with another 195 missing. 12,135 people were injured by the temblor, over 1,400 of which were said to be in serious condition. The quake's epicentre was in the Yushu county. On Tuesday, rescuers were still searching for survivors buried beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings in and around the town of Jiegu, one of the most badly affected places.Officials have increased their relief efforts, bringing food, blankets, tents, and other assistance to the area.Yesterday, an official remembrance day for those killed was held; public entertainment was limited and national Chinese flags flew at half-mast.In a radio broadcast, government officials in Myanmar say that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis which struck the nation on May 2-3.As rescue workers reach the most hard hit areas of the storm, they only began to realize the damage it caused. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of Myanmar.Hundreds of thousands are homeless and another three thousand have been injured by the storm. Drinking water is contaminated and food is becoming scarce as the United Nations (U.N.) and other organizations try to get supplies to the region."The U.N. will begin preparing assistance now to be delivered and transported to Myanmar as quickly as possible," said Paul Risley, a World Food Program (WFP) spokesman.Aid began to arrive in Myanmar on Tuesday, where more than 40,000 are still listed as missing. However, the delta-region of the Ayeyarwady River remains cut off from the rest of the world.Caryl Stern, head of the United Nations Children's Fund, said "Our biggest fear is that the aftermath could be more lethal than the storm itself."George W. Bush called on the government of Myanmar to allow the United States to provide disaster assistance. The United States Navy reportedly has three ship in the Gulf of Thailand which are within a short distance of the area. The country has had strained relations with both the United States and the European Union.Richard Horsey, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid, said "The biggest problem will be to reach the affected areas. There will be a huge logistical problem."Helicopters and boats would be needed to reach many areas. Horsey said, "The big concern is waterborne diseases. So that's why it's crucial to get safe water in. Then mosquito nets, cooking kits and clothing in the next few days." "Food is not an emergency priority. Water and shelter are," Horsey added.Later Police statements have confirmed a rise in the death toll from the London bombings, which initial reports on July 7 had put at 33.At 08:51 BST a bomb exploded on an Hammersmith & City Line Underground train 91 metres/100 yards into the tunnel from Liverpool Street. Seven are known to be dead.At 08:56 BST a bomb detonated on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross and Russell Square. Twenty-one are dead.At 09:17 BST a bomb exploded on a Circle Line train between Edgware Road Station and Paddington. The blast blew a hole in a wall, and another train was hit by debris from it. A third train is also involved. Five died.At 09:47 BST a No. 30 bus (Hackney - Marble Arch) blew up at the junction between Tavistock Square and Woburn Place. Two people were killed.Around seven hundred people were injured. Three hundred were taken to hospital by ambulance, while the remainder presented themselves.The official death toll for a recent derailment in Pakistan has been lowered from 58 deaths to 40. The Karachi Express from Karachi to Lahore left the rails at high speed in Sindh province.At least 115 passengers were injured in the crash, of which ten remain in hospital. Most of them were returning from the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.Fourteen of the sixteen cars that comprised the service were derailed. The force of the accident, which occurred near Mehrabpur, about 250 miles from Karachi, was such that two were completely destroyed and the rails were severely damaged.Junaid Qureshi, director of operations at state owned Pakistan Railways, who operate the service, said that the official figures are now 40 dead and 269 injured. Most of the casualties were in the two carriages that were destroyed. "The position now is that there are 40 dead," Qureshi told reporters, adding that the original figure appeared sourceless. "I do not know where they (the officials) got it from."He went on to say that of the 40 deceased, 39 bodies had been returned to families, whilst one body remained unidentified and is currently awaiting being claimed at a morgue in Karachi.However, there are still conflicting reports about the number of casualties. Representatives of the Edhi Foundation, Pakistan's largest private emergency service provider, which attended the scene, said that the foundation had removed 45 bodies from the wreckage, while Mohammed Shafi Toor, head of the state-owned hospital at Mehrabpur, put the figures at 46 dead and 290 injured.Meanwhile, an official inquiry has been launched. "The inquiry is underway and will be completed within the next five days," said Pakistan Railways Secretary Ghiasuddin, continuing to say that the panel conducting the investigation will make recommendations as a result of it's findings. It is believed the track failed due to extremely low temperatures.Officials have re-opened the line having repaired the damaged section.A tsunami that was generated in the South Pacific by a powerful undersea earthquake has killed at least 110 people, according to authorities.The majority of the fatalities occurred in Samoa, where rescue workers say at least 84 people were killed. Another 24 people are confirmed dead on American Samoa, while at least seven fatalities have been reported in nearby Tonga.  The US Geological Survey says an 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck early Tuesday local time. It generated waves that devastated coastal areas, knocked down buildings and sent cars floating out to sea.  Strong aftershocks followed the initial earthquake, with at least one measuring a magnitude 5.6. Tsunami alerts were issued for the entire South Pacific region but were later canceled. Survivors fled to high ground and stayed there for hours.The death toll in a collision between two helicopters in Arizona, United States has been finalised at seven after the only survivor died. James Taylor was an emergency nurse present on one of the helicopters, which were both Bell 407s performing patient transfers to nearby Flagstaff Medical Center. The other six, including two patients, died at the scene.Taylor, 36, worked at Salt Lake's St. Mark's Hospital, and also part-time with Life Flight, who operated the helicopter he was on board at the time. He had only recently started working at St. Mark's after 17 years at the Intermountain Medical Center, and was also a veteran of Desert Storm as a member of the Utah Army Reserve.His sister said of him "He loved serving others ... and especially being paged for lifeflight duty. He gave his life trying to save another ... he truly was a hero." As well as an extended family mostly residing in Utah Taylor is survived by his wife and three young sons.Zion's Bank have established the James Taylor Memorial Fund to help the family he left behind.The death toll from last week's fire on Kornat island in Croatia has risen to eight. Two firefighters, Tomislav Crvelin and Ante Crvelin, badly injured by the fire, have died.Three firefighters are still in serious condition at the Zagreb hospital. A 17-year-old was also among the casualties.The fire was started by a cigarette thrown by a Kornati National Park employee, who is now in custody.More than 650 people have now died after a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Java on Monday afternoon. In the past few days, around 100 dead bodies have been recovered, and it is estimated that over 300 people are still missing. An underwater earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 triggered the deadly wave which ravaged a 200km stretch of Java's southern coast.Thousands of people are continuing to camp in the hills. They are too apprehensive to return home due to fears of another tsunami, but according to Reuters, health officials are worried about the threat of disease among those who are still in refuge. "The risk of catching diseases is there because they live in an open area with limited tents and water," said Rustan Pakaya, from the health ministry's crisis centre. He added that people were being given injections to protect them from diseases like measles, tetanus and cholera. Areas worst hit, like the small town of Pangandaran, are beginning to return to normal, and many businesses there have begun to open up again. "The market and many shops are already open today and although they are not operating fully, things are slowly returning to normal," district spokesman Wasdi bin Umri told AFP.Yesterday, Indonesia's President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono toured  Pangandaran and met people who were staying in a temporary camp. The Indonesian government has been criticised for failing to inform residents living on the coast that a tsunami was looming. After the underwater earthquake was detected, US and Japanese agencies issued warning notices, but the government has admitted it was unable to transmit the bulletins to coastal areas. Speaking yesterday, Mr Yudhoyono vowed to hasten efforts to build an early warning system planned after the 2004 Asian tsunami. "We want to expedite efforts to get infrastructure for the tsunami warning system in place," AP quoted him as saying. "I will work with parliament to get the budget".A Welsh woman has died in a Thai hospital from injuries sustained in the September 16 crash of One-Two-GO Airlines Flight 269 at Phuket International Airport, bringing the death toll to 90.Bethan Jones, 22, from Porth, had been one of 42 original survivors in the crash, which her boyfriend, Alex Collins, 22, did not survive. They were three days into a round-the-world trip when the crash occurred.Jones, whose family flew to Thailand in order to be with her, never regained consciousness after the crash, which left her in critical condition with burns across more than 50% of her body. Two days after the crash a military aircraft had flown her to a specialist unit at the Bangkok General Hospital for treatment.Her family released a statement in which they thanked family, friends and "the community of Porth and Rhondda and all Bethan's friends and work colleagues for their kindness and sympathy".Bethan's body will be flown home this weekend. Alex's body is already in Wales, and his funeral is scheduled for Monday.At least 57 people are now known to have died when a boat designed similar to a traditional dhow capsized one mile of the coast of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. Seventeen were Indian and a further 13 of the dead are British; people of another six nationalities are also known to have died. The passengers were mostly foreigners from the Nass-Murray and Roberts construction company, and were enjoying an evening dinner cruise in celebration of their completion of part of the Bahrain World Trade Centre towers. Most who died were dining on the lower deck, and were trapped below.Over 130 people were onboard the boat at the time, although some say the boat was only licensed to carry 120. Others say the limit was 150. Eyewitnesses say the boat was overloaded. The boat capsized in calm seas soon after it left, trapping many below. Helicopters from the US Navy searched for 13 missing persons until Friday morning, when the search was called off. The dhow had been modified to have an extra, higher deck making the vessel less stable. The exact cause is unknown - suggestions from eyewitnesses include the boat suddenly turning left, being hit by a wave, and many of the passengers moving to one side of the boat together. The Bahrain Interior Ministry is to investigate the accident and establish if the boat was seaworthy.The death toll from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on Friday has risen to more than a thousand, with many people still missing, according to reports issued over the weekend.While Japan's police says that only 637 are confirmed dead, media reports say that over a thousand people have been killed, with several hundred bodies still being transported. Thousands more are still unaccounted for; in the town of Minamisanriku, Miyagi Prefecture alone, up to 10,000 people are missing. Four trains that were on the coast have yet to be located.In the aftermath of the disaster, evacuations of around 300,000 people have taken place; more evacuations are likely in the wake of concerns over a damaged nuclear power plant. According to Prime Minister Naoto Kan, around 3,000 people have been rescued thus far. 50,000 troops from the Japanese military have been deployed to assist in rescue efforts.The tsunami generated by the quake has destroyed communities along Japan's Pacific coast, with up to 90% of the houses in some towns having been destroyed; at least 3,400 structures have been destroyed in total. Fires have also sprung up among the impacted areas.At least 82 people have died after a school collapsed in Haiti on Friday. The death toll rose from 61 to 82 after rescue workers found 20 students and their teacher between two floors of the school. At least 200 more are feared trapped and over 100 have been injured, some seriously."This morning we found a classroom with 21 inside — students and their professor — and they are all dead," said Rene Preval, the president of Haiti during a press conference on site of the disaster.Reports say that the third floor of the College La Promesse Evangelique in Pétionville was under construction when the collapse happened, but it is not known if that was the cause.  Pétionville is a suburb of Port-au-Prince.  The collapse occurred at 10:00 a.m. local time on Friday while school was in session.At least 700 children were attending the school when it collapsed, ranging from kindergarten to secondary grades, with the students' ages ranging from 3 to 20 years old.The school is reported to have partially collapsed eight years ago, and residents living near it moved in fear that the rest of it would collapse on their homes. After the first collapse, the owner of the school attempted to buy the homes and properties surrounding the school.Witnesses and residents fear that the school was improperly repaired after the first collapse. Police are investigating the two incidents to determine if criminal charges will be filed. One member of the Haitian parliament also called the repaired building "not quite solid", suggesting that there were too many people inside the building, putting it over capacity.Nearly 30 people are now thought to have died after a 4-storey building collapsed in the Nigerian city of  Lagos. More bodies, some alive, and others dead, are still being recovered from the wreckage in the Ebute Metta area of Lagos after the apartment block suddenly gave in on Tuesday evening, local time. The building also housed restaurants and 18 shops on the ground floor and rescuers are unsure of how many people remain trapped below the ground. The Nigerian  Red Cross said it believed around 75 people may have been inside, but survivors are claiming the death toll is considerably higher. So far, 50 survivors have been hauled from the wreckage, and still, three days after the collapse, voices are being heard from below the rubble."People have survived in this kind of situation for up to five days,” Timothy Oladele, the Chairman of the Nigerian Red Cross told  Reuters, “We are just in the third day in our own case and by God's grace we will find some alive."The building, in Nigeria’s largest city, is thought to have been just three years old, and officials are blaming poor construction for the collapse. Local media are reporting that city planners only gave permission for a two storey building on the site, not four. The owner of the construction company is believed to have fled; Lagos Governor Bola Tinubu pledged to punish the rogue developer. ”We know their other buildings and definitely, they will not go unpunished," he told local press today.The sprawling industrial city of Lagos has a history of poor construction and maintenance. In March 2006, one of the city’s tallest buildings, damaged after a fire, collapsed during a thunderstorm.The Associated Press (AP) and CNN reported about midday UTC that the death toll in the Sunday's accident on K2 has risen to eleven.Two Dutch climbers have been rescued by helicopter, the AP also said. CNN reports that two of the people killed were climbing up the mountain in an attempt to assist others.AP says that about two dozen climbers began the accent of K2, the world's second-highest mountain, Friday after the weather had cleared. Climbers are listed as from the Netherlands, South Korea, Italy, Norway, France, Nepal, Serbia, Pakistan and Ireland.Trouble began on Sunday when several climbers decided to turn back citing rope placement problems. CNN reports the group was climbing in two teams and both were descending from near the summit when an a large chuck of ice fell sweeping three people off the mountain.The ice triggered an avalanche which caused confusion within the party.Wilco Van Rooijen, one of the two rescued Dutch climbers, spoke to AP via phone. He blames poor planning in addition to the avalanche."Everything was going well to Camp Four, and on summit attempt, everything went wrong," Van Rooijen said.He told AP that a low-cloud bank caused whiteout on the mountain, but he chose to begin his decent from the area near the summit."There was a Korean guy hanging upside down," Van Rooijen told AP. "There was a second Korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also, and they were trying to survive but I had also to survive."One stranded climber, Marco Confortola, an Italian who spoke with his brother by phone, described the events as hellish."Up there it was hell. During the descent, beyond 8,000 meters (26,000 feet), due to the altitude and the exhaustion I even fell asleep in the snow and when I woke up I could not figure out where I was," Confortola told the ANSA news agency.A helicopter rescue for Confortola had to be delayed due to poor weather. He told his brother that he was able to walk down to the base camp.CNN reports that this is the deadliest accident on K2 since records were kept in 1939. 66 people — not counting those in the latest incident — have died on the mountain since then.Richard Stanek addressed reporters in a news conference on Friday morning, officially revising the death toll from the collapse of the I-35W bridge to five, up from four. This fifth victim was pulled from the wreckage of a tractor trailer rig which had been engulfed in flame.According to Bloomberg the number of missing persons is currently eight.Later that night, MSNBC's Keith Olbermann reported that the toll has risen again to six. This victim died after having been hospitalized.The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in its 2005 report card said that the $59.4 billion spent annually to improve transportation infrastructure condition is well below the $94 billion needed.So far, three people (including a baby) have been killed, and at least ten others were injured when two semi trucks collided in a tunnel on Interstate 5 (Newhall Pass) between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita California, United States in the late evening of October 12, setting off a chain reaction pileup that involved between 28 and 30 semi trucks and one passenger car. The wreck caused a massive fire that burned for over six hours. It was previously believed that only 13 semi trucks were involved."The fire burned in a very intense state for approximately four hours and basically consumed everything that was burnable," said John Tripp the Fire Chief for L.A. county. As a result of the crash, the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a declaration of a state of emergency for Los Angeles County.The debris has been removed and officials say that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because the structure of the tunnel has been compromised. The tunnel passed inspection in June of 2006."The walls of the tunnel are fairly heavily damaged. None of the rebar appears to be melted, damaged at this point in time. But it's completely separated from the walls in a number of areas, so we lose vertical support when that happens," said California Department of Transportation official, Doug Failing.Tripp added that more bodies could be buried in the wreckage, saying "...we're going to have to do a very methodical search. There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape." So far authorities have yet to identify the three people who were killed.A full investigation is being conducted into what caused the crash.In two separate ferry incidents, more than 40 people are feared dead in the Philippines. The first accident on Thursday involved a wooden ferry near Limbones Island colliding with a large fishing boat, the Nathalia. 46 people were rescued, four confirmed dead. The BBC reports as many as 24 may still be missing from the incident.The second incident occurred today, south of Manila at Batangas. The MV Baleno-9 capsized after listing and taking water, drowning three. At least twenty remain missing. Commander Armand Balilo, a coastguard spokesman, said rescue operations are continuing. "Hopefully their [search] flights will not be fruitless and they may find a few more of the missing," he told a local radio station, "We always hope that there will be survivors."The Philippines has a history of storms, lax safety enforcement, and aging boats, leading to common ferry accidents despite the island nation's heavy reliance on ferries for transportation.According to new information about the earthquake of December 26, 2004, it was the longest-lasting earthquake ever recorded."Normally, a small earthquake might last less than a second; a moderate sized earthquake might last a few seconds. This earthquake lasted between 500 and 600 seconds (about 10 minutes)," said Charles Ammon, associate professor of geosciences at Penn State University.  "Globally, this earthquake was large enough to basically vibrate the whole planet as much as half an inch, or a centimeter. Everywhere we had instruments, we could see motions," Ammon continued.This quake released an amount of energy equal to a 100 gigaton bomb, according to Roger Bilham, professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado.  And that power lasted longer than any quake ever recorded.  “No point on Earth remained undisturbed,” said Bilham.The quake was centered in the Indian Ocean, and it created the biggest gash in the Earth's seabed ever observed.  It measured nearly 800 miles, about the distance from northern California to southern Canada.  Scientists have upgraded the magnitude of the quake from 9.0 to around 9.1-9.3, which is a dramatically more powerful quake.  "Two hours after the earthquake has occurred, the wave is spreading out from the Bay of Bengal," Thorne Lay, professor of earth sciences and director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz said. "Two satellites went over, with the capability of measuring the elevation of the ocean surface.  It was just good luck that the passage of the satellites caught the tsunami in motion. There will be more earthquakes of this type, and with more humans exposed to the hazard there will be more devastating losses of life. What we hope to do is develop technologies that can minimize that loss.".Findings reported in the various papers:In Sri Lanka, more than 1,600 kilometres from the epicenter, the ground moved nearly 10 centimetres.The rupture spread from south to north. Seismometers in Russia recorded the quake at a higher frequency because it was moving toward them, while those in Australia measured a lower frequency as it moved away.When the surface waves from the Sumatra quake reached Alaska they triggered a swarm of 14 earthquakes in the Mount Wrangell area.The United States' first major blizzard of the winter season has left much of the New England region covered in snow. Stretching from Virginia to Maine, the storm, packing winds of over 50 miles per hour (80.5 kilometres per hour), dropped more than two feet of snow in some areas. Residents prepared for what would be one of the worst nor'easters in quite some time. The storm contained similar conditions to a category 2 hurricane. Wellfleet, Massachusetts saw an 80 miles per hour wind gust, the strongest recorded throughout the storm. Connecticut, New York and Maine all recorded wind gusts of over 60 miles per hour and gusts of over 70 miles per hour blasted Cape Cod.A total of 32 inches (81.3 centimetres) fell in Rahway, part of the hardest-hit state in the storm's path. Most New Jersey cities received over a foot of snow, while Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, and Maryland all had snow totals topping out at around 1 foot (30.48 centimetres) with Massachusetts topping out at a foot and a half.On Monday, travel proved difficult, with flights from Philadelphia, Newark, New York City, Hartford, Boston, Portland, and Washington, D.C. canceled. Drivers also ran into problems on major highways as accidents were unavoidable on the slick roads.The Deepwater Horizon is dead. Almost five months after an explosion rocked an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana and caused a natural disaster on a scale not seen before, BP yesterday announced that that the well has been completely shut off. Thad W. Allen, the former Coast Guard admiral who is heading up the response to the oil spill on behalf of the U.S. government said in a statement that the well now "poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico." He also released a U.S. goverment department's confirmation of the news. "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has confirmed that the cementing operation on the Macondo well was successful, that the well has been permanently sealed with cement plugs, and that pressure tests verify the integrity of the plugs," it read. BP released a statement, describing the sealing of the well as "a significant technological accomplishment and another important milestone in our continued efforts to restore the Gulf Coast."Early on Sunday morning, those aboard Development Driller III drill rig, which aided in the shutting down of the well, successfully conducted a pressure test, and concluded that cement pumped through a relief well into the Macondo well was going to hold. The tests concluded that the cement finally put an end to an environmental disaster that has affected BP, the wildlife on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and the hundreds of people who make their living by fishing in the area. Forrest Travirca, who lives in Louisiana, said he was very angry with the response by BP and the authorities. "All the brown spots and patches you'll see on this beach for the next nine miles is oil, too... And if you dig down a few inches or a few feet, you'll see oil, too. And if you walk into that marsh back there, you'll find oil," he said. "So don't tell me we dodged any bullets. Or that it wasn't so bad. 'Cause I've been out there every day since May dealing with all that oil we dodged. It just makes my blood boil."Admiral Allen admitted that the disaster was far from over. "Although the well is now dead, we remain committed to continue aggressive efforts to clean up any additional oil we may see going forward," he said, adding that the response, lead by his team and BP "has been driven by the best science and engineering available. We insisted that BP develop robust redundancy measures to ensure that each step was part of a deliberate plan, driven by science, minimizing risk to ensure we did not inflict additional harm in our efforts to kill the well. I commend the response personnel, both from the government and private sectors, for seeing this vital procedure through to the end."The spill began in April, when Deepwater Horizon exploded, killing eleven people, after the blowout preventer failed. Oil began to leak into the Gulf, soon developing into the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. 4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, causing damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries. Extensive measures were used to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline of Louisiana, including skimmer ships, floating containment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades. Scientists have also reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil not visible at the surface. The U.S. Government has named BP as the responsible party, and officials have committed to holding the company accountable for all cleanup costs and other damage.BP released their internal review into the spill last week, but it was rebuffed by the head of Greenpeace's energy campaign, Jim Footner, who said that it was "highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP." However, he said, "the real problem is our addiction to oil, which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk. The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now. The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy." The report concludes by stating that decisions made by "multiple companies and work teams" contributed to the accident which it says arose from "a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces." In their statement, BP said that they "will continue sharing what we have learned in an effort to prevent a tragedy like this from ever being repeated. We also believe that the industry will gain important insights on how to be better prepared to respond to any future incidents."At least five bombs exploded in crowded markets and streets in the heart of India's capital New Delhi on Saturday killing 30 while injuring more than 100 people. The blasts at Ghaffar market in Karol Bagh, at Connaught Place and Greater Kailash took place in a quick succession.In an e-mail sent to a local television news channel, a group claiming to be the Indian Mujahideen, appeared to take responsibility for the explosions."In the name of Allah, the Indian Mujahideen has struck back again. Do whatever you want. Stop us if you can," the e-mail said. The station says it received the e-mail before the explosions occurred.Indian Mujahideen, a militant Islamist group, have claimed the responsibility of several attacks against civilian targets in India, claimed responsibility for the 2008 Delhi bombings through an e-mail sent to Indian media, which were all triggered within a 45-minute period. More than 400 people have died since October 2005 in bomb attacks on Indian cities such as Ahmedabad and Bangalore.The first explosion rocked Gaffar market area of Karol Bagh in central Delhi at 18:15 (IST) in which at least 20 people were injured. The explosive was kept near a Maruti car, and resulted in a cylinder blast in an auto rickshaw, which was subsequently thrown up several feet into the air.Immediately after, two explosions took place in Rajeev Chowk in which at least 10 people were injured. Police and witnesses said that went off in dustbins in and around Rajeev Chowk, a shopping and dining area popular with tourists and locals in the centre of the city. The first of these blasts occurred on Barakhamba Road, near Nirmal Tower and Gopal Das Bhavan. The second bomb exploded in the newly constructed Central Park in the centre of the Rajeev Chowk roundabout, built above one of the main stations of the Delhi Metro. An eyewitness reportedly saw two men place the bomb in a dustbin at Central Park.Two explosions rocked M-Block market in Greater Kailash-I at about 18:40 (IST), the first near the popular Prince Paan Corner, and the other near a Levi's store. The latter damaged 10 shops. Relief activities have been started while security has been put on high alert across the country following the deadly blasts in the Indian capital.A Delta Air Lines passenger jet skidded off the runway at New York City's LaGuardia Airport in snowy weather on Thursday, causing a shutdown of the airport, according to officials.  The jetliner was carrying 127 passengers and five crew.The MD-88, operating as flight 1086, was flying in from Atlanta when it lost control after landing. There were a few minor injuries while the passengers were evacuated. The plane was significantly damaged and the airport was shut down. One of the runways reopened around 2 p.m., although an earlier Federal Aviation Administration statement had put reopening at 6:59 p.m.The city fire department said five out of at least 28 passengers with minor injuries were hospitalized.Pat Foye, executive director of the port authority, said the plane was two thirds of the way along the 7,000-foot runway when it began a leftward skid that nearly sent it into the water. The National Transportation Safety Board sent an investigator for the flight data recorders. Delta stated they would work with authorities to investigate.Delta Air Lines flight 1457 departing from Atlanta made an emergency landing after it blew out a tire during take-off. The flight was destined to Portland, Oregon. There are no injuries reported at this time.The Boeing 737-800 departed from Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport Thursday afternoon. The flight was carrying approximately 160 passengers and six crew members. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said that the flight turned around when the flight crew noticed the blown out tire. The flight was forced to go into a holding pattern to burn off fuel for more than an hour before it landed. The 737 landed safely at around 1500 local time (2000 UTC).Delta did not immediately return calls inquiring about the flight. After some time Delta Spokesperson Anthony Black told the Associated Press that the 160 passengers on board would be put on a future flight to Portland.Delta Airlines flight 4951 made a safe emergency landing at JFK International Airport in New York City yesterday after the aircraft's right landing gear failed. There were 64 passengers and crew members aboard as well as 3,000 gallons of flammable fuel.  The pilot maintained composure as he radioed air traffic control.  He reported “The right gear is stuck up.  The other two are down”.  When asked which runway he wanted to land on, he stated “Whichever one would be better for you all.”   They settled on Runway 31 Right.  Flight crew members prepped passengers for the emergency landing by telling them “heads down stay down!” in the crash position.  The captain told them to brace for impact over the intercom. Rescuers on the ground feared the worst on account of the 3,000 gallons of flammable fuel.  As the plane landed, sparks flew from the righthand side but the plane did not catch fire.  All 64 people were shuttled safely from the aircraft to the airport.Demolition work is set to resume at the former Deutsche Bank Building in New York after work was halted last August over a fire that killed two firefighters. The city's Department of Buildings lifted an order to cease work imposed at the time as the buiding's owners have installed fire control systems at the condemned 26 storey office block.The building was seriously damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks as the south tower of the World Trade Center collapsed, filling the building with debris, much of it toxic. In subsequent years fragmental remains of hundreds of victims from the disaster were removed from the building and regulators had lengthy debates over how the tower should be demolished.After the fire, work immediately halted and a grand jury criminal investigation followed. The fire is thought to have been triggered by a cigarette discarded by a worker on the site, which will ultimately home one of five new towers planned for the area devastated by the attacks. Of major importance were polyethylene and plywood decontamination barriers which both fueled the blaze and hindered the movement of firefighters. It is thought they may have blocked escape for the two who were killed by the fire.The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, who owns the property, says 300 asbestos removal workers are set to begin shifts of six days per week are set to clear toxic material remaining on 19 floors of the tower. This means the work force has increased by one hundred. Decontamination chambers will now be present across all floors instead of merely the ground floor.Amongst the new safety measures are fire-proof sheetrock decontaminaton chambers, improved safety within the actual chambers and two fire-rated interior stairways. The modifications were made by LVI Environmental Services with work commencing in February this year.The tower at 130 Liberty Street was originally intended to be gone by 2005, but the deadline was expanded to 2008. The fire means the work has been delayed a year with a revised estimated time of completion being 2009.According to the Chinese Ministry of Railways, the accident occurred at around 0210 local time (1810 UTC) when the train hit a section of track that had been damaged by a mudslide.  The derailment killed at least nineteen, and an additional 71 people were injured.  Eleven of the injured have been seriously wounded.The rescue operation cleared the tracks of both the derailed train and around 8,000 cubic meters of debris from the mudslide.  An estimated 2,000 people took part in the rescue effort.The accident has closed the line on which it occurred between Shanghai and the city of Kunming.  Limited southbound traffic is expected to resume at around 2000 local time (1200 UTC), with full operation possibly restored by midnight (1600 UTC).A massive earthquake, registering 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale, struck Haiti yesterday, destroying many buildings, disrupting communications, and burying an unknown number of people underneath rubble. Thousands of people are feared to have been killed by the tremors, which were felt as far away as Venezuela.Witnesses say bodies were lining the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, after the quake struck on Tuesday afternoon, sending a cloud of dust from falling buildings into the sky. The quake was centered about sixteen kilometers from the capital, and struck at a depth of just ten kilometers, exacerbating the damage. At least 27 aftershocks were also recorded, the strongest of which came in at 5.5 and 5.9 magnitude. A tsunami alert was initially issued following the tremor, but it was retracted shortly afterwards.Buildings across the capital have collapsed, including the presidential palace and the headquarters of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti. However, the president, René Préval, and his wife reportedly survived the collapse of the building. The country's envoy to the United States believed damage costs could reach billions of dollars.UN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said many people were in the UN building when it went down and they remain unaccounted for. A Brazilian military official later said four Brazilian soldiers who were part of the UN mission were killed.UN Peacekeeping Chief Alain LeRoy said the organisation is working to learn the fate of its personnel. "As we speak there are still over 100 people unaccounted for under the rubble.  We do not know about their fate [...] some people have been extracted out of the building - but only less than 10 for the time being.  Some dead, some alive. So we do not know for the time being the fate of the others. But of course, we are extremely, extremely concerned."The Notre Dame of the Assumption Cathedral in Port-au-Prince was also destroyed, killing Joseph Serge Miot, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince."[...] It would appear that all those who were in the building, including my friend [UN mission head] Hedi Annabi [...] and all those who were with him and around him are dead," said French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. In a statement released yesterday, the UN remarked that "[f]or the moment, a large number of personnel remain unaccounted for."Further details have emerged on the deaths of two people at the annual Norway Rock Festival in Kvinesdal. Eight other people were rescued unconscious from a bus at the site. Meanwhile, it has been reported that British heavy metal band Motörhead opened their performance at the festival with a minute's silence for the deceased.The names of those killed have now been released. They are Terje Brueland, 32, and Anita Wathne, 31. As reported earlier, they were an unmarried couple and left behind three children. It is believed that the accident occurred due to carbon monoxide poisoning.The police investigation has uncovered that the double-decker bus had been converted into a motorhome. Electricity was supplied by way of a generator, which was placed inside a locked compartment on the vehicle. Police believe that fumes from the generator leaked inside without anyone noticing, as carbon monoxide is odourless and colourless.The problem was discovered at 2 p.m. Saturday by friends who had gone to the bus to check up on those inside. Five of the eight survivors were taken to hospital in Stavanger and two to Oslo's Ullevål University Hospital. Three remain in serious but stable condition, while two have been released.The two killed in the bus came from Oltedal in Rogaland County, where they are reported to have a large family who are looking after their children along with friends.The festival lasted three days and drew crowds of 5-6,000 people.All residents within a half-mile radius of the EQ Resource Recovery chemical plant in southeastern Michigan were asked to voluntarily evacuate on Tuesday due to a chemical plant explosion.  ClickOnDetroit reported that nearby residents who choose to stay were told to close their doors and windows.The plant, located in Romulus, near Wayne, is about 15 miles southwest of Detroit.  Initial reports stated that a single explosion in a chemical tank was the cause of the fire.  The cause of this explosion has not yet been determined. Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ confirmed that all employees made it out of the plant before the explosion occurred, and that HAZMAT teams were on the scene of the fire. Wayne County Sheriff Warren Evans announced that no injuries were reported in the initial explosion. However, approximately 32 people were treated for breathing problems at nearby Oakwood Annapolis Hospital, due to the subsequent fire. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) analyzed soot in the area and determined that it did not pose a substantial health risk. The company in question has been the target of numerous enforcement actions by the EPA in the past, including a $240,000 fine in 1999. A major chemical processed at the plant is acetone, the main ingredient in nail polish remover, which is known to be toxic in high dosages, especially to those with lung conditions. Acetone is also an eye and skin irritant.  Other chemicals, such as antifreeze, are also processed there. Two Detroit-area law firms have filed class action lawsuits against EQ Resource Recovery on behalf of local residents, and a third is considering similar action.Romulus is the site of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), the primary airport for the Detroit area and a hub for Northwest Airlines. However, airport service was not affected. News of this explosion came as a chemical plant explosion in Story City, Iowa happened just a day before and three similar explosions in Texas occurred July 28.The EQ Resource Recovery Inc. and EQ Holding Company chemical processing plant near Romulus, Michigan, about 15 miles southwest of Detroit, was the scene of explosions and fire on Tuesday evening, continuing into Wednesday.  The cause of the explosions and fire has not yet been determined.  Firefighters announced their intention to let the fire burn itself out, which was estimated will take approximately 8 hours.  However, parts of the fire continued to burn as of Wednesday evening.  There were evacuations of approximately 3000 residents from the area, but no reports of any serious injuries or fatalities.  However, approximately 20 people were treated for breathing problems at nearby Oakwood Annapolis Hospital.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is analyzing soot in the area to determine whether it poses a substantial health risk.  The company in question has been the target of numerous enforcement actions by the EPA in the past, including a $240,000 fine in 1999.A major chemical processed at the plant is acetone, the main ingredient in nail polish remover, which is known to be toxic in high dosages, especially to those with lung conditions.  Acetone is also an eye and skin irritant.Romulus is the site of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), the primary airport for the Detroit area and a hub for Northwest Airlines.  There was no indication that airport service would be affected.This morning local time an explosion, now officially considered a terrorist incident, was reported on a London underground train which was stopped at Parsons Green in south-west London.The explosion has been officially confirmed caused by an improvised device placed in a white bucket inside a Lidl shopping bag. Reports also indicate a timer attached to the explosive. At least 29 people were injured, NHS England said this afternoon.Officers and ambulance staff were on the scene this morning, with reports of burn and crush injuries. Detectives and MI5 were investigating.BBC News presenter Sophie Raworth described seeing a woman on a stretcher with face and leg burns.In a statement after the incident, British Prime Minister Theresa May said, "My thoughts are with those injured at Parsons Green and emergency services who are responding bravely to this terrorist incident."A three-year-old girl has been bitten by two dingoes while holidaying with her parents on Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia. The two animals responsible for the attack have since been captured and euthanised by wildlife rangers.The child was on the beach with her parents while they waited to be transported to the mainland on the Hook Point barge. Witnesses report that the child wandered into nearby sand dunes where she was repeatedly bitten on the legs by the wild dogs. Members of the Fraser Island Preservation group believe that the parents are to blame for the attack. Spokeswoman Bree Jashin has stated the attack was the result of inattentiveness. “The child was unsupervised and you have to ask how could a three-year-old get so close to the dingoes?” Experts such as Environmental Department manager Terry Harper say the attack is uncharacteristic for the dingoes on Fraser Island which is said to be one of the last remaining safe havens for purebred dingoes. "This is a very timely reminder for everybody about how important it is to stay very close to your children on Fraser Island," Harper stated. "Adults should always stay very close to their children. We know that they do excite dingoes."The child received medical attention at the site of the attack and was then transported to Gympie Hospital."18 hours of mass hysteria" (according to the Sunday Times of India) broke out last Friday in Mumbai as hundreds of residents flocked to Mahim Creek, one of the most polluted creeks in India that receives thousands of tonnes of raw sewage and industrial waste every day after reports that the salt water had suddenly turned "sweet".  Television reports showed people drinking water on the spot with their hands, and others bathing, apparently to wash away their sins with the "holy" water.At the height of the hysteria, bottled mineral water was selling for Rs 50 (RM4.50), with people buying the mineral water simply for the bottles, pouring away the mineral water and filling the bottles with water from the creek.News reports of the Mahim Creek incident sparked further mass hysteria at Gujarat within hours, with residents there claiming that seawater at Teethal beach in Valsad had also turned sweet. About 400 people had gathered by the beach in the evening.In the aftermath of the incident, local authorities stated that they were being were extra vigilant because of the possibility of a severe outbreak of water-borne diseases, such as gastroenteritis as a result of so many people drinking contaminated water.  The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board had warned people not to drink the water, but despite this many people had collected it in bottles, even as plastic and rubbish had drifted by on the current.  The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai had ordered a bacteriological report into the "sweet" water, but suspected that "contamination in the water might have been reduced due to the waters from Mithi River flowing into the mouth of Mahim Bay".By Saturday morning, the hysteria had died down, as the taste of the water had returned to normal.Divers yesterday recovered three bodies from December's air disaster in the Java Sea. Added to four retrieved on Friday, they bring the total to 100. An additional 62 victims remain to be recovered.There were no survivors when Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed on December 28. The six-year-old Airbus A320-200 was 40 minutes from Juanda International Airport with 155 passengers and seven crew, bound for Singapore's Changi International Airport. Most were Indonesians, with three South Koreans, one Malaysian, one Brit and one French person on board.One of the latest bodies was a uniformed man strapped into a cockpit seat, and presumed to be either Indonesian Pilot Iriyanto or French co-pilot Remi Emmanuel Plesel. Underwater currents have complicated recovery of the other body from the cockpit. Efforts to retrieve the entire aircraft last month were abandoned. Some bodies have been found roughly 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the crash site, floating near Sulawesi.Iriyanto and Plessel had over 8,000 hours experience between them. Iriyanto has a decade of experience training other pilots, and previous employers include the air force. Their actions have come under scrutiny as the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) investigates.The aircraft entered an excessively steep climb before stalling, the NTSC said last month. It took three minutes for the plane to reach the water, during which time the flight crew tried to regain control. Bloomberg claims the flight crew switched off computers designed to aid them after they issued alerts. AirAsia has declined to comment pending the NTSC investigation, which is expected to continue for several months. The Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics suggests weather caused the disaster, suggesting ice led to engine failure. NTSC head investigator Marjono Siswosuwarno last month reported satellite data showed storms as high as 44,000ft. The plane was attempting to avoid storms in the minutes before contact was lost.The National Search and Rescue Agency has over 60 divers working to retrieve the bodies.Divers from the Philippine Coast Guard and Navy were given a clean bill of health from any effects from the toxic waters surrounding the sunken passenger ferry, MV Princess of the Stars off the coast of Romblon province.Fifty six diving personnel tasked to retrieve bodies of passengers trapped inside the ferry will undergo more tests on Saturday for any ill effects from pesticides that are suspected to have leaked in the cargo hold of the ferry.Retrieval operations for the bodies of passengers were suspended on Friday when the cargo manifest of the ship showed large quantities of a highly toxic pesticide called endosulfan. Authorities feared that the pesticides could have contaminated the waters around the sunken ferry and could prove fatal to the diving crew.Divers started to complain on Thursday of experiencing skin irritation after surfacing.The Philippines government slammed the ferry's owners for not immediately divulging the contents of the ferry's cargo hold and threatened to add other possible criminal charges against the owners.Environment officials are concerned that the pesticide could cause a severe damage to the delicate aquatic environment around Romblon province.Tuesday, February 11, 2014According to California's Madera County Sheriff's office, DNA tests performed on bones found at the site of a plane crash in October, are confirmed to be those of adventurer Steve Fossett.The last known whereabouts of Fossett was on September 3, 2007. He had taken a small plane from a ranch in Minden, Nevada to search for a site to try and break the land-speed record. He had not been seen since and authorities feared his plane had crashed and he had died."A California Department of Justice Forensics lab has determined that items containing DNA - discovered last week - match James Stephen Fossett's DNA," said the Sheriff's department in a statement.Items were found last week at his crash site in the Sierra Nevada Mountains along with his identification card, a one-hundred dollar bill, and a pair of shoes. A few bones believed to be his were found a short distance from the crash. Teeth marks were found in his ID card, leaving authorities to believe his body was moved by animals. Forensic investigators say Fossett would have died immediately on impact.In September, a hiker found other identification cards and money just under a mile from where authorities later found the wreckage of his plane on October 1.A dolphin has died after a collision with another dolphin in mid-air during a stunt performance at Discovery Cove, a sister park of SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. This is the first time an incident of this nature has ever occurred since the park opened in 2000.The dolphin, a 30-year-old female named 'Sharky' collided in mid-air, head on, with her co-performer 'Tyler', a 13-year-old male, during a live show at the park on Saturday April 26. Sharky died a short time later after suffering head injuries. Tyler was not injured, but is still being observed closely.Both dolphins have successfully completed the stunt over 100 previous times, but this time it is reported that Sharky miscalculated her jump. At least 30 people were watching the show when they collided."This is a very unfortunate and very rare incident. While it is not unusual to have two animals performing at the same time, we are reviewing the situation to ensure even such a random incident does not occur again. We never had animals collide before," said a spokeswoman for the park, Becca Bides.According to analysts, the major earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit on Friday is likely to have major economic impacts within Japan, though the global economy is unlikely to be significantly affected.Rolling blackouts are planned to start on Monday in addition to continuing through this summer and may have to take place next winter as well. According to an economist, Michala Marcussen, at Société Générale, a country's power supply "is a critical factor" to its economy. Marcussen said that if Japan's electrical infrastructure was severely damaged, then "that could have a durable [sic] impact on the economy."The overall negative impact of the earthquake on Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to be only a few tenths of one percent, though that is expected to be enough to push Japan's expected recovery from its current economic slump back by several months.  According to the Nomura Group, "[w]e had projected an April-June exit [from the slump]  but now forecast July-September or possibly October-December." It added that most of the economic effects of the quake will probably be felt early this summer.To fund the current rescue efforts, the Japanese government is reportedly considering raising taxes, as the estimated cost of rebuilding affected areas is as high as one percent of the total five trillion dollar GDP. Japan currently carries high levels of debt, estimated to be about ten trillion dollars, which is expected to make additional government spending for rebuilding efforts difficult.The Japanese stock market index Nikkei 225 dropped 1.7% at the end of the day Friday; it closed fourteen minutes after the quake and tsunami struck. Beginning on Monday, when trading resumes, the Bank of Japan is, according to its governor, prepared to inject money into the economy in order to stabilize the markets.An undercarriage door opened during a Qantas flight yesterday, causing the flight to make an emergency landing. The Boeing 737-800 plane departed Adelaide, Australia, was bound for Melbourne, but returned to Adelaide to make the landing at approximately 6:15 p.m. local Australian time.According to Qantas officials, the door did not close correctly over a wheel bay and the flight turned back towards Adelaide when it was near Murray Bridge. Passengers in the plane said there was chaos in the cabin when the undercarriage door opened.When the jet arrived back in Adelaide, some of the passengers aboard were transferred to another Qantas flight. Some passengers refused transport on another Qantas flight though, and chose to fly with Virgin Blue or another method of transport. It is not known how many passengers were aboard, but the plane could have carried up to 168 passengers.This incident follows a hole blasting in the fuselage of a Qantas 747 international flight to Melbourne, forcing the plane to land in Manilla, Philippines.Yesterday, Jetstar boss Alan Joyce was named the new chief executive of parent company Qantas; he will take over for Geoff Dixon on November 28.Two bombings in the northern Caucasus region of Russia have killed at least twelve people and injured another eighteen.The explosions occurred in Kizlyar, a town in the Dagestan province. The first bomb was detonated in a car near a school, killing two police officers, at around 08.30 Moscow time (04.30 UTC). According to Russian interior minister Rashid Nurgaliyev, police tried to stop the car before it blew up, as they had thought it looked suspicious. The second explosion was caused by a suicide bomber disguised as a police officer. He had approached the scene of the first bombing as passerby and security gathered, and set off explosives.According to officials, many of the dead were policemen, among them the Kizlyar police chief."In the blasts, twelve people have been killed, nine of them were police officers, including the Kizlyar police chief. Twenty-three others have been hospitalized, suffering with various injuries," commented a spokesman for the Investigative Committee of Russian Prosecutor General's Office, Vladimir Markin, to Interfax. He also noted that a criminal investigation into the bombings has been started.Two bombings in Karachi, Pakistan have killed at least twenty-two people and injured over fifty. In spite of tight security across Pakistan, a motorbike carrying explosives was able to hit a bus carrying people to a religious procession, killing twelve. A second bomb killed at least thirteen when it exploded an hour later outside the local Jinnah hospital emergency ward where the victims, mainly Shia Muslims, of the first attack were being treated. The bus attack took place on a shopping street near the main road that connects the airport with the city, but it is not clear whether it was a suicide bomber ramming the vehicle, or whether the motorbike was parked along side the bus before detonation. The second bombing by the hospital, which struck within a crowd of protesters that had gathered to mourn the people killed in the first attack, was likely a suicide bombing, according to local police.Ghylam Nabi, a local police officer, told Reuters that a third bomb had been found inside a television set in the hospital premises. It was defused successfully.40 Shia Muslims were also killed in a car bomb attack today in Karbala, Iraq, as they took part in the final day of the religious festival known as Arbaeen, the 40 day mourning for the grandson of the Prophet Muhammed. This was the third bombing in Karbala this week.At least thirty people are dead in Cameroon after a bus rolled over, reports say. The accident happened on Saturday near the city of Bafia, 135 kilometres or so north of the capital Yaounde.The accident happened when the bus lost control, rolled down a hill into a ditch, and broke in half. Officials say the death toll may increase.Traffic police official Fifen Idrissou told the Agence France-Presse news service: "At the scene we've identified around 30 bodies but the death toll could be much greater given that some of the injured evacuated before we arrived reportedly died. The bus lost control [...] 200 metres further on the bus hit a ditch. It rolled over several times," he said.It wasn't immediately clear how many people were aboard the bus when it crashed.According to reports, at least 35 people are dead while six are seriously injured in the northern Philippines after a bus plunged into a 100 meter deep ravine. The accident occurred early Wednesday near the city of Baguio, 200 kilometres north of the capital Manila.The accident happened when the brakes on the vehicle failed and it rolled down a hill into a ditch.  Officials say the death toll may increase.  There were a total of 47 passengers on board.The bus conductor, John Patrick Flores, survived the accident with only minor injuries by jumping out the door before the bus fell into the ravine. He said that "the driver tried to ram the bus into a mango tree to prevent it from falling, but failed."At least 50 people are dead, mostly children, and an unknown amount injured and trapped after a three-story school collapsed near the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince. So far, rescuers have rescued at least 75 people, who have been taken to a local hospital, some in serious condition. School was in session, which left dozens more trapped, and officials say the death toll is likely to climb. Five houses surrounding the school were also severely damaged or destroyed as a result of the collapse.Reports say that the third-floor of the College La Promesse Evangelique in Pétionville, was under construction when the collapse happened, but it is not known if that was the cause. The collapse occurred at 10:00 a.m. local time."The whole school collapsed on the kids, and you know on the phone you can hear so many, so many children, you know, crying, crying. And saying, 'This one is dead, that one is dead'," said Michaele Gedeon, a worker with the Haitian Red Cross to CNN. Gedeon also states that hundreds of people; rescue workers, bystanders, United States officials and United Nations peacekeepers along with the Red Cross were on scene sifting through the debris, using their hands and shovels, trying to find survivors."UN blue helmets are on the scene clearing rubble and trying to help people buried under the debris. If we can’t get rescue equipment in and out it’s going to be hard to help the people trapped in the building," said a spokesman for the U.N. in Haiti, David Wimhurst.At least 700 children attend the school, ranging from kindergarten to secondary grades, with the students' ages ranging from 3 to 20-years-old.The school is reported to have partially collapsed eight years ago, and residents living near it moved in fear that the rest of it would collapse on their homes. After the first collapse, the owner of the school attempted to buy the homes and properties surrounding the school.Witnesses and residents fear that the school was improperly repaired after the first collapse. Police are investigating the two incidents to determine if criminal charges will be filed.A deadly boat fire earlier this week near Santa Cruz Island off the coast of California, United States, resulted in the death of all 33 passengers. The boat, Conception, which caught fire overnight in open seas, carried 33 passengers and six crew members. Five people, who were all crew, were rescued while the rest are presumed dead. The Conception was a 75 ft (~23 m) long commercial boat on a three-day voyage for underwater diving with Monday being the Labor Day holiday. The fire started some time after 3 a.m. local time {1000 UTC) Monday. "This is probably the worst-case scenario you can possibly have," said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown. "You have a vessel that's on the open sea, that is in the middle of the night. I mean, it's 3:30 in the morning." As of late Tuesday, 20 bodies had been recovered, eleven women and nine men, according to Brown.The United States Coast Guard (USCG) called off its search late on Tuesday. USCG Captain Monica Rochester told the press a nearly 24-hour search mission involving three helicopters covering 160 square miles (~415 km2) had discovered no further signs in the water. "It is never an easy decision to suspend search efforts," she said. "We know that this is a very difficult time for families and friends of the victims."Authorities have not named a cause for the fire, though it was intimated there were no signs of an explosion and the Conception was known to have the requisite fire suppression equipment. CNN, however, reported on a distress call from someone on the Conception, who may or may not have been the captain. The excerpts, which are only the dispatcher's words were reported by CNN as such: And there's 33 people on board the vessel that's on fire, they can't get off? [...] Roger, are they locked inside the boat? [...] Roger, can you get back on board and unlock the boat, unlock the door so they can get off? [...] Roger, you don't have any firefighting gear at all? No fire extinguishers or anything?" [...] Was that all the crew that jumped off? [...] Roger, is the vessel fully engulfed right now [...] Roger, and there's no escape hatch for any of the people on board? – USCG dispatcher, CNNCommenting on the radio communications, Captain Rochester said the situation had "a lot of adrenaline, a lot of confusion. [...] [The dispatcher] was trying to ask for information." However, she added, "there are no locked doors in accommodation spaces" where the passengers would have been.The Conception was owned by Truth Aquatics and chartered by Worldwide Diving Adventures. Both companies have been in operation since the 1970s according to USA Today.A Garuda Indonesia passenger plane with 140 people on board has crashed and burst into flames in Yogyakarta, Indonesia today. At least 21 people have died after the jet plane overshot the runway at 0700 local time. The Indonesian air company Garuda said earlier that at least 49 persons were killed but have now changed the estimate.95 people have been confirmed as having survived the crash, including Din Syamsudin, the leader of the Muhammadiyah Islamic organisation. Survivors are being treated in a local hospital for severe injuries and burns. Survivors report that the aircraft was shaking violently prior to the crash. The operations chief at Adisucpito International Airport said that the front wheel of the jet was on fire as it landed, causing the vehicle to skid off the runway and veer into a boundary fence. An engine then broke away from the aircraft and the fuselage burst into flames. It took firefighters over two hours to put out the blaze. Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has confirmed that there were 9 Australians on board the flight, 4 of whom remain missing. The Australians included officials and journalists heading to Yogyakarta to prepare for the Foreign Minister's arrival there. The journalists known to be onboard include Cynthia Banham of the Sydney Morning Herald and Channel Seven cameraman Wayne Sukarda. Fairfax media are still attempting to contact a journalist from The Australian Financial Review.Dozens of people have been killed as a result of flooding in Plateau State, located in the central part of Nigeria. The flooding occurred as the result of a large amount of rainfall close to Jos, a city in the north of the state, causing overflow of a dam.The Red Cross has reported the recovery of 35 corpses, while BBC News Online has placed the death toll at a minimum of 39. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said approximately two hundred houses had been sunk or wrecked. A significant number of the affected houses had been built of mud.Manasie Phampe, leader of the Red Cross of the state, explained: "Rainwater and water from the Lamingo dam which overflowed swept across several neighbourhoods in the city". The death toll is anticipated to increase by authorities, with 35 reported missing. "We are still searching for more bodies as many people have been declared missing," Phampe added.The National Emergency Management Agency of Nigeria (NEMA) has initiated a relief effort. Edward Maigida, Director of Relief and Rehabilitation at NEMA, said "[t]wo camps have been opened to provide temporary shelter for the affected persons in Gangare Primary School and Islamiyya Secondary school".More than forty passengers have been hospitalised, fourteen of whom are seriously injured, after an Airbus A330-300 owned and operated by Qantas suddenly departed level flight, hurling people into the airliner's ceiling.The flight between Singapore and Perth, Australia was cruising at 37,000 feet when a cockpit alert was triggered warning the flight crew of a possible malfunction with the aircraft's elevator, which controls pitch.The aircraft then performed an uncommanded climb of 300 feet, before nosing down hard and falling an undetermined distance believed to be several thousand feet. During this descent, many of the 303 passengers and 10 crew were thrown against the ceiling, injuring many of them. The flight crew declared 'pan-pan', one level below a full life-threatening emergency, and performed an emergency landing at an air base at Learmonth after informing air traffic control of flight control difficulties and injured passengers.The injured people were flown to hospital by Royal Flying Doctor Service and Skywest Airlines. The most seriously injured were suffering from broken bones and three people had concussions.An investigation has been launched. Although such events are often blamed on turbulence, it has been suggested by industry experts that the circumstances of the accident are more in keeping with a computer malfunction. The A330 is a fly-by-wire aircraft.Pakistani officials have said that at least 100 people were killed and over 200 injured after a car bomb exploded in a marketplace in the city of Peshawar on Wednesday. The attack was the deadliest in the country in this year.Initially, large fires were reported to be burning around the marketplace, which was crowded with people. The flames spread easily because there were many stores in the area selling flammable fabrics. Police said the blast was heard throughout most of the city, and the explosion reportedly left a hole in the ground up to ten feet wide.The Associated Press reported that many of the victims are women."There was a huge blast. There was smoke and dust everywhere. I saw people dying and screaming on the road," said an eyewitness, Mohammad Siddique, to the Agence France-Presse news agency.Several buildings collapsed as a result of the detonation, and rescue workers searched through the rubble looking for survivors beneath the debris.Muzamil Hussain, a member of local medical staff, described his experiences to the Associated Press: "There were a lot of wounded people. We tried to help them but there were no ambulances so we took the victims on rickshaws and other vehicles. There were no police. The police and government didn't help us, the police even opened fire on us.""Bodies are scattered and badly burned because of the fire caused by the explosion. The explosion took place in a very crowded market,"  Mohammed Naeem, a spokesman for a local ambulance service, said.Some people expressed anger that the bombings managed to be carried out in broad daylight in a crowded area. "What kind of security alert is this? It was an explosives-packed car. Look at the mosque, it ceases to exist anymore. For God's sake, do something,"  said a local middle-aged shopkeeper, as quoted by the CNN news agency.A state of emergency at the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, where many of the wounded people were hospitalised, was called soon after the explosion. Hospital officials appealed to the public and to other medical centres for blood donations.The bomb attack happened just hours after Hillary Clinton, the United States Secretary of State, flew to the nation to discuss peace with Pakistan's military commanders and political figures. Clinton will be in Islamabad for three days.Clinton condemned the attack. "These attacks on innocent people are cowardly. They are not courageous. If the people behind these attacks were so sure of their beliefs, let them join the political process," she said.The bombing also comes just days after Pakistani military forces captured the town of Kotkai, the hometown of Taliban Chief Hakimullah Mehsud, and one of his top officers, Qari Hussain.As many as 45 people have been killed and six others were injured after at least four gunmen with grenades stormed a wedding reception in the village of Bilge located in Turkey. Many of those killed were women and children. The attack is not believed to be related to terrorism."According to our investigations so far nothing indicates that this is a terror attack but a larger investigation is being run by the regional prosecutor," said the interior minister of Turkey, Besir Atalay. The attack is believed to be part of an ongoing blood feud between two families. Al Jazeera says the attack may also be related to rival gangs of village guards.According to one unnamed witness as quoted by Reuters, "a few people" wearing masks entered the house where the reception was being held, "spraying the place with bullets" and began to shoot people, with the attack lasting at nearly 15 minutes. At least 200 people were believed to have been attending the reception.More than 50 people have been killed after a plane crashed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, causing president Joseph Kabila to fire his transport minister.The Russian-built Antonov An-26 twin-turboprop cargo plane went down into a market in the African nation's capital, Kinshasa, killing 51 and injuring at least 25, mostly on the ground. Of the plane's crew, only the Congolese flight engineer survived the accident.The Congolese air safety record is one of the worst in the world, and this is the latest and deadliest in a string of recent aviation accidents and incidents. According to presidential spokesman Kudura Kasongo, the reason behind the sacking of transport minister Remy Henri Kuseyo Gatanga is "for being incapable of organising the aviation sector".Transport Minister Rémy Kuseyo had previously said the aircraft should never have taken off due to a ban imposed three weeks ago on the use of Antonov aircraft in the country due to safety concerns. He feels his dismissal is unjust, saying "Measures had been taken... "I had taken measures, but I am not the one who was to have put the measures in place on the ground."Saleh Kinyongo of the Humanitarian Affairs Ministry revised previous information that the entire flight crew had been killed, saying to reporters "We now know there is a survivor in hospital. He's the mechanic (of the plane)... He's alive and well. He's talking and he's even been on TV." His name was given as Dede Ngama and he is receiving treatment at the Roi Baudouin hospital in Kinshasa. Previously, Russia's foreign ministry had reported that all three of the flight crew were Russian nationals and were killed in the crash. This has, however, been confirmed as accurate for the pilot and co-pilot.It is known that shortly after takeoff, the plane experienced technical difficulties and initiated fuel dumping, then contacted air traffic control to request an emergency landing. Aircraft often dump fuel prior to emergency landings shortly after takeoff, as the aircraft are too heavy to land safely with full fuel loads. However, after about ten minutes, the plane suddenly plunged down into a market and houses in a residential area. The Russian Foreign ministry reported that upon takeoff the plane lost a propeller, and that a wing sheared off when the plane impacted a bank of trees.An emergency meeting of Congo's cabinet was held yesterday to investigate how existing air safety regulations could be improved, including possibilities of better inspections and tougher penalties for non-conformers.The crash site has proved difficult to secure from onlookers and petty criminals. Local police have already arrested several people attempting to steal scrap metal, engine parts and any other valuables from the fire-scorched wreckage.The crash has provoked national outrage, with local newspapers using headlines such as "Another flying coffin kills again," and "Congo's killer skies,". The government had promised to improve poor safety standards.The plane belonged to Africa One, but had been leased to Manilla Airlift. The aircraft had undergone a safety inspection prior to it's departure from nearby Ndjili international airport.The International Air Transport Association has described Congo's aviation safety record as 'an embarrassment', while all Congolese airlines except Hewa Bora Airways are on the List of air carriers banned in the EU.A powerful bomb blast on a Shia procession in Khanpur, Punjab killed 20 people and injured 30 yesterday. Those responsible for the blast are unknown, although Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has been mentioned.According to a police statement to Reuters, the bomb was detonated by remote control near an electric pole as the procession advanced towards the hussainia. Eye witnesses told that the loud explosion caused people to run away haphazardly. One of the witnesses, Imran Iqbal, apprised, "Debris was everywhere, and a cloud of dust engulfed us. Many people died on the spot." The wounded were rushed to local hospitals in Khanpur and Rahim Yar Khan.The people were processioning to mark the holy day of Arba'een.After scouring the Caribbean islands, Hurricane Dennis moved on toward the U.S. Gulf coast but not before its deadly fury was unleashed upon the region's many island nations.The fury of Dennis overnight wracked the area with torrential flood, causing rains, dangerous rip tides, tidal swells, and winds up to 175 miles per hour. According to reports from humanitarian aid organizations, at least 10 died in Cuba and 22 in Haiti. As of 9 July 2005 18:06 (UTC), reports of dead and injured from other Caribbean countries had not been reported.Cuba, which has a national emergency response program in the event of Hurricanes, evacuated 660,000 people from the eastern part of the island, which was considered to be the most vulnerable part of the country. But Saturday morning, president Fidel Castro confirms in a national broadcast that at least 10 Cubans died as a result of the storm. Dennis slammed into Cuba's southern coastal province of Cienfuegos Friday afternoon with Category 4 force winds. It emerged on the north side of Cuba considerably weakened to Category 1.In nearby Jamaica, although the island was spared the full force of Dennis, rains and tidal swells caused widespread flooding in 28 communities. Hundreds of families faced a weekend camped out in emergency shelters as health officials inspected flood areas for safety.35 children were killed and more than 40 were injured in a fire which roared through the ABC child care center in Hermosillo, Mexico on Friday afternoon. Among the injured were six adults, most who have yet to be identified. Over twenty other children have been hospitalized with burns. They have been transported to local hospitals and other medical facilities in the United States. Neighbors, employees and firefighters broke walls to rescue unconscious children and babies from the fire in the converted warehouse building which was equipped with only one exit.Three air ambulances, medical equipment and fifteen burn specialists were dispatched to the scene where children between the ages of six months and five years old perished from smoke inhalation. The majority of the injured and killed were under three years of age, said government officials.Red Cross rescue workers say that 100 children were being cared for when the fire broke out. Sonora state Gov. Eduardo Bours confirmed that 142 children were in the child care center. Already, 27 of the 31 child fatalities have been identified, as parents continue to await news on their children.Preliminary reports state that the fire may have started in the neighboring tire and car warehouse and spread to the childcare center.

The tanker left the road and smashed through a bridge near the small town of Wolsingham and landed on the Weardale Railway below with the driver being thrown from the cab.The driver, who was in his twenties, had been airlifted to a hospital in Newcastle-upon-Tyne but later died from his injuries. The Calor Gas tanker was said to be carrying 13,000 litres of liquefied petroleum gas at the time of the accident and nearby homes were evacuated. The fire crews who responded to the incident did not detect any gas leaking from the tanker.Chris Hockaday, from County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service described the problems they were facing, "There are a few options to consider - one is to see if we can decant the gas out into another vehicle. The problem is that it's gone off next to a bridge so it will be difficult to get any heavy lifting gear into position. We may have to right the vehicle and move it along the tracks somehow, maybe even using a train." The Weardale Railway operates over a five mile section of restored track between Stanhope and Wolsingham. In a statement the railway company said, "There will be no further services on Weardale Railway until further notice and we apologise to our passengers for any inconvenience this may cause. We have appointed an incident manager and have alerted the Rail Accident Investigation Board and Her Majesty's Rail Inspectorate. We will not be able to assess the damage until the site of the accident has been declared safe by the fire brigade and the tanker removed from the track."A driver has been fined after following the directions of his satellite navigation system, leading him to the edge of a massive cliff drop in West Yorkshire, England. Robert Jones, who is 43 years old, appeared in Calderdale Magistrates Court on Tuesday, representing himself. He was prosecuted by Waseem Raja. Waseem told the court: "The defendant was using a TomTom satellite navigation system. The defendant followed that system to the letter, so much so it led him up a lane clearly unsuitable for motor vehicles.""The path was such it was not designed for use of motor vehicles yet Mr Jones slavishly continued to follow the satnav system to the point where his eyes and his brain must have been telling him otherwise to such a degree he was not exercising proper control of the vehicle."On March 22, 2009, Robert Jones was driving a BMW 5 Series and was trying to get to his home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire after staying with friends in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. He was unsure of the route home and so followed his satellite navigation system, which was in the car. He continued to follow instructions despite being told that the narrowing dirt track he was driving on was actually a road. At the time the petrol gauge in the car indicated that he had just seven miles of fuel left. Because of this, Jones was desperate to find a filling station. He became so distracted by the sat-nav that he didn't realise his mistakes until he struck a fence on the edge of a 100 foot (30.5 metre) drop. The battery on his mobile phone had run out so he had to walk to a nearby village to get help.In his defence, Robert told the court: "I might have been an idiot for taking the wrong road or carrying on but I have not driven without due care or attention. I'm sorry it happened. I certainly would not do it again. I drive 5,000 miles a week and I never have had a problem with it. I had no reason not to trust it."Jones was found guilty of driving without due care and attention. He was fined £370 (US$610) with £500 ($824) costs and ordered to pay a £15 ($24) victim surcharge. He also got six points on his licence and had to pay £1,000 ($1,624) in recovery charges.A driver in the New South Wales city of Bathurst, West of Sydney has had a lucky escape after rolling his vehicle onto its side and narrowly avoiding other vehicles.The accident occurred shortly before 9 a.m. AEST today when a small Sports Utility Vehicle sped out of Gilmour Street, Kelso onto the Great Western Highway before attempting to turn into Lee Street. Witnesses told Wikinews that the car hit the median strip, spun and then rolled onto its side.Michael Reynard, a witness to the accident told Wikinews it was amazing that only a single vehicle was involved. "The road is busy at this time of day, he only just missed cars on the other side of the road," said Mr Reynard."He came flying around the corner, hit the median strip and just lost it. The next thing you know, he was on his side," recalled Mr Reynard.Nobody was injured in the accident.Acting via his lawyers, Volodoymyr Zhukovskyy, 23, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to seven counts of negligent homicide in New Hampshire, United States.  Zhukovskyy waived arraignment and did not physically appear in court. According to police and county officials, Zhukovskyy was driving a pickup truck "erratically and across the double-yellow center line" on U.S. Route 2 in Randolph, New Hampshire on the night of June 21 and struck a group of motorcycles, killing seven riders and injuring three more.Travis Hood, who witnessed the collision, said "I don't really don't know what he was doing [...] The truck pretty much was like in the middle of the yellow line, and the guy pretty much cleaned out the whole — the bikes were riding side-by-side, and the guy cleaned out pretty much every bike that was there besides one of them."Zhukovskyy was arrested Monday at his home in the neighboring state of Massachusetts and waived extradition to New Hampshire.According to police in Baytown, Texas, Zhukovskyy has been involved in traffic collisions before. Reportedly, he struck a guard rail on June 3 and flipped the Mack truck he had been driving on its side.  According to investigators, Zhukovskyy said he had over-corrected after being cut off by another driver, and he was not cited for the incident.  The Associated Press reports Zhukovskyy has also been stopped for suspicion of driving while inebriated.The court determined Zhukovskyy's driving history rendered him a danger to himself or to the public. For this reason, he was not granted bail. His trial has been scheduled for November.LOS ANGELES — Eleven charges of murder have been brought against the driver who caused the Glendale train crash, in which 11 people died. Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, could well face the death penalty for his actions. It appears he parked his Jeep Cherokee on the railway line with the intention of committing suicide, but then changed his mind and left the vehicle. Three trains carrying approximately 350 people were involved in the crash, injuring up to 200 passengers.His arraignment was delayed from Thursday to Friday due to his medical condition. He was charged with 11 counts of murder and was held without bail in a hospital's jail ward after apparently slitting his own wrists and stabbing himself in the chest. Prosecutors have filed 10 counts of murder with so-called special circumstances, and will add the 11th victim to the complaint shortly. Under California law, this makes Alvarez eligible for the death penalty.The accident was caused as a result of a chain-reaction derailment of three Union Pacific trains. Investigators are continuing to try to determine the exact sequence of events.Fire authorities struggled to manage a vast string of wildfires stretching across the eastern part of Texas on Sunday. News sources report that prolonged dry conditions and excessive winds were the main factors in the blazes.Traffic along Interstate-20 near Longview, Texas was backed up for several miles.

One evacuee told Wikinews, "I have [homeowner's] insurance. I got my dog, that matters a' lot to me."The African Union made a plea on Tuesday for the international community to come to the aid of Somalia. This is a country where one in three, (ten million people) is suffering from a severe  drought, a situation complicated by warring rebel factions. In 2009, UNICEF discontinued air deliveries to areas controlled by the Islamic insurgent group al-Shabab due to militant threats. Last week al-Shabab said it would welcome the presence of humanitarian groups, provided aid groups did not have a "hidden agenda".On Wednesday, the United Nations airlifted supplies to a part of the country controlled by al-Shabab, flying five metric tons of medicines, food and water supplies to Baidoa, a rebel-held  town, 155 miles south of Mogadishu. Maulid Warfa,  UNICEF emergency officer, in an interview with state-run Radio Mogadishu, said a very critical humanitarian crisis exists in rural communities where people have lost their livestock and farms after the worst drought in six decades. The aid is to help them and their children who are extremely malnourished.When Warfa, was asked  about the arrest of two aid workers by al Shabaab, one with UNICEF, Warfa did not confirm or deny it. Instead he emphasized the desperate need of  Somalians for assistance.Although some feared a new Kenyan camp would result in more Somalis fleeing to Kenya, Kenya has announced in will open a new refuge camp near the Somalian border within ten days which will hold 80,000. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said, "Although we consider our own security, we can't turn away the refugees."In a nearby refugee camp in Kenya where 370,000 people are squeezed into a space set up for 90,000 people, conditions are desperate aid workers said.Somalia's Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali in an interview with the BBC said  a refugee camp has opened  in Mogadishu, but that the government had "meagre" resources to help drought victims. "We are appealing to the international community to take the matter seriously and to act quickly to save as many lives as we can," he told the BBC.On Thursday, UNICEF said Somalia's drought and refugee crisis is "the most severe humanitarian emergency in the world."On Friday, Jens Oppermann, the country director of Action Against Hunger (Action Contre La Faim, ACF), told AFP: "We are no longer talking about a humanitarian crisis or a humanitarian emergency. We are seeing this as a humanitarian catastrophe."This is the second consecutive year the summer rains have not come, and according to the BBC,  the current drought threatens the lives of at least four million in Somalia.On Thursday, several shootouts occurred in Mexico leaving nine cartel suspects dead, killing seven police officers, and injuring close to 30 others.Following the several gun battles, police seized 1.2 million pesos (more than US$92,000), cocaine, assault rifles, police uniforms, bullet proof vests, handcuffs, hand grenades, and a variety of other military weapons.Federal agents went missing and a search initiated by the Hidalgo state police found them alive near an auto racetrack in the Mineral de la Reforma municipality.

Its inhabitants were surprised by the giant waves that destroyed the most of the costanera and that reached the city square.Pichilemu, that means in Mapudungun language small forest, is one of the most famous Chilean resort towns in the central zone of Chile. It is recurrently visited by surfers from all the world, because the Punta de Lobos beach is considered one of the best for surf practice worldwide.Central Pichilemu was not severely damaged by the earthquake, but the tsunami caused significant destruction. The Fishermen Creek, located in front of the beach, was completely destroyed, and its machines are now unusable. Most of the Agustín Ross architecture that characterized the city, three of them being National Monuments of Chile, were damaged. The Agustín Ross Mirador, a famous location in front of the beach, located less than 200 meters from the Fisherman Creek, was completely destroyed. Its famous balustrades were washed away or thrown asunder. Many restaurants, kiosks and a circus were affected by the tsunami.The rural parts of Pichilemu, like Ciruelos, Rodeillo and Espinillo feature houses constructed from adobe. Many were more than 100-years old, and were destroyed or are now uninhabitable.The most powerful aftershock was produced almost 40 kilometers in front of the coast of Pichilemu, at the 03:10 local time (07:10 UTC) in March 2, with an intensity of 5.5 in the Richter scale, according to the USGS.The Intendant of the O'Higgins Region, Juan Núñez, had a meeting with the Governor of the Cardenal Caro Province, Loreto Puebla, the Mayor of Pichilemu, Roberto Córdova, and naval and military authorities, juntas de vecinos representatives. They decided to leave the Carabineros police force to maintain the security of the city.File:Fukushima-1.JPGJapan's government has declared its first ever "nuclear emergency" after pressure rises in the No. 1 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, combined with a minor radiation leak, caused a 10 km radius around the plant to be evacuated. An attempt to relieve the pressure inside the containment vessels of the plant has been delayed.The Tokyo Electric Power Company's 40-year old nuclear facility, 270 km NE of Tokyo, reported mechanical difficulties with its cooling system, although the automated shutdown systems worked correctly. With the core reaction shut down the plant is no longer actively generating heat, but the fuel rods continue to generate excess heat and radiation and need constant cooling.The cooling system runs a constant flow of water to take the heat away from the submerged fuel rods, but the pumping system requires electricity to operate even after the plant is no longer producing electricity itself—generally from back-up diesel or natural gas generators.USGS reported that an earthquake struck the Dominican Republic region with a magnitude of 8.0. It was registered on last Friday at 01:38:55 a.m. (05:38:55 UTC) at the epicenter, which was located 102 km from Higüey, La Altagracia, Dominican Republic. However, it was later reported as a magnitude 3.4 earthquake by the Puerto Rico Seismic Network. The report caught the attention of the news media until the USGS reported it was 3.2.The depth of the aftershock was located 89.8 km (55.8 mi), and no damage or injuries were reported. It has been reported as a Haiti aftershock.The Haiti earthquake reached magnitude 7.0 Mw, with an epicentre near the town of Léogâne, almost 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) west of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. More than 100 aftershocks have been registered since that earthquake. The United Nations reported that the earthquake has caused more than 225,000 deaths, a number which is expected to rise.Another earthquake of magnitude 5.3 hit the Kermadec Islands region. The epicenter was located 1,138 kilometers from Nuku'alofa, Tonga and had a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). It took place at 13:35:34 (01:35:34 UTC) at the epicenter. No tsunami warnings have been issued by NOAA for this earthquake.A Japan earthquake took place in the Ryukyu Islands at 11:19:58 at epicenter (02:19:58 UTC). It reached a magnitude of 5.1, had a depth of 35 kilometers and the epicenter was located 80 kilometers from Naha, Okinawa.Two strong earthquakes shook the north of Argentina and a remote region of the Amazon, in Brazil.The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that the first earthquake took place at 9:27 (-3 UTC) 165 kilometers from the city of Cruzeiro do Sul, in the Amazonian state of Acre and measured 6.1 degrees on the Richter scale.According to Elio Murilo, sergeant of the fire brigade of Cruzeiro do Sul, the phenomenon was not felt and no injuries or property damages were reported. The telluric movement took place at a depth of 632.9 kilometers.At 12:34 (-3 UTC) another earthquake with an intensity of 6.2 degrees in Richter scale shook the north of Argentina, and the phenomenon was also felt in some Bolivian cities. According to the USGS, the epicentre was the Jujuy region 140 kilometres east of Tarija (Bolivia) at a depth of 247 kilometers.The authorities have not reported any injuries or property damage.Australia —The whole of the east coast of Australia has been lashed by severe storms in the last 24 hours, with at least one reported death. Wind gusts in some areas reached 110 kilometers per hour, and flash flooding and power cuts were reported from Far North Queensland to Tasmania in the South.State Emergency Services (SES) crews are stretched to the limit, working into the night to cope with the effects of the freak weather.A major earthquake occurred at 1:58AM Saturday off the coast of Indonesia. It originated from the Banda Sea, roughly 195 kilometers from Ambon City. The earthquake measured 7.7 on the Richter Scale and occurred at a depth of about 341 kilometers said the U.S. Geological Survey.The quake sent people running for their lives as fears mounted that the quake might have caused a massive tsunami.But good news came as the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center  said in an e-mail advisory, "this earthquake is located outside the Pacific. No destructive tsunami threat exists in the Pacific Ocean or elsewhere based on historical earthquake and tsunami data."No deaths or major injuries have been reported as of yet.In December of 2004, a major earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 struck just off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a major tsunami, killing nearly 300,000 people and leaving millions more homeless.Earthquakes frequently take place in the area due to it being positioned on a volcanically active region referred to as the The Ring of Fire.Three tornadoes struck western Massachusetts on Wednesday according to the National Weather Service's (NWS) Taunton, Massachusetts office, the biggest and longest being an EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita scale according to meteorologists at the agency.The EF-3 tornado was described by the NWS in a statement as a "very significant tornado" which "will be noted not only for its intensity,but also for the length of the continuous damage path". A tornado is considered an EF-3 when its winds exceed 135 mph (218 km/h).The tornado which began in the community of Westfield, Massachusetts tore a path of destruction on its 39 mile (63 km) course through western Massachusetts, killing four and injuring 200. After passing through Westfield, the twister continued into West Springfield, Massachusetts ripping roofs from buildings and causing a few structures to collapse.It then crossed the Connecticut River into Springfield, Massachusetts, the state's third largest city, where it caused extensive damage in the south side of the downtown area damaging commercial brick buildings and destroying many homes throughout the city.From Springfield, the tornado passed into the towns of Wilbraham, Massachusetts and Monson, Massachusetts where wide deforestation was caused by the tornado, including tree bark being stripped from remaining trunks. Furthermore, the center of Monson suffered widespread damage with many homes completely destroyed. The twister continued into Brimfield State Forest where it caused more deforestation and continued from many miles when it reached the Southbridge Municipal Airport where numerous aircraft "were lifted off the ground and into the woods east of the airport."The tornado continued until it reached the southwest part of Charlton, Massachusetts where the tornado dissipated. Overall, over 19 communities reported damage. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency and ordered 1,000 National Guard soldiers to respond to the area to help with relief efforts. Looting has been reported in the areas affected by the tornado.Two smaller EF-1 tornadoes touched down in Wilbraham and North Brimfield mostly in wooded areas. The North Brimfield tornado traveled 1.3 miles before dissipating and the Wilbraham one traveled 3.6 miles before dissipating.Tornadoes are uncommon for the New England area and Massachusetts, however, they have happened before. One of the deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts, the state's second largest city, in 1953 where an F-4 tornado tore through the city for 80 minutes, killing over 90 people.An attempt to cap the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has hit yet another obstacle, reported officials from British Petroleum (BP).Friday night's attempt to install a 6-inch (15.2cm) tube into the leaking drill pipe was only the latest in a series of efforts by BP to stop or slow down the spill. Previously, the oil company had tried to enclose the pipe with a large container dome, and then lowered a smaller "top hat" container dome. The siphon tube method is designed to reduce the amount of oil flowing into the ocean, but is not a permanent solution to stopping the leak altogether. It will draw the oil from the broken pipe to a tanker at the surface, said BP.The tube was to be inserted into the broken pipe by robotic submarines, but the attempt on Friday to do so was unsuccessful, causing it to be taken back up for changes. The problem was a metal frame on the tube, which had changed position and this prevented the tube sent down from the drill ship Discover Enterprise from connecting. The tube had not been inserted into the leaking drill pipe before it was brought back up.BP said that it would try again Saturday night (local time) to slow the leak using a reconfigured tube. If this attempt is unsuccessful, they will use the smaller dome to cap the leak, and may also try to plug the leak by covering it with trash, mud, or concrete. The company is already in the process of drilling relief wells to completely stop the leak, but this is expected to take several more months. The amount of oil currently leaking from the pipe is disputed, and BP said it has spent several hundred million US dollars in response to the oil spill.BP was also given permission yesterday by the US Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency to use chemical oil dispersants to combat the spill.Efforts to salvage the Indonesian naval vessel Arung Samudera from where she ran aground on the Sunshine Coast Queensland, have been delayed due to poor weather conditions.The 35-metre, tri-masted vessel was originally grounded on August 23 in stormy weather at Inskip Point, near Rainbow Beach. A salvage contractor has being brought in to rescue the stricken vessel, her hull is intact and it is believed the ship is in no imminent danger of breaking apart.However, the tall ship did drag its anchors and break its rudder and centreboard during the beaching.Australian Navy Commander Forbes Peters says that although salvage has been postponed until early next week, the vessel will be surveyed today by the salvage firm."To develop a plan for how they would salvage the vessel of the beach, that's going to involve a tugboat pulling the thing off the beach with a longline."The trouble with actually conducting the salvage will be the sea state... Until the weather abates there really will not be able to do much in terms of salvage," he said.The 18-man crew - six officers and 12 sailors - of the New Zealand-built vessel have managed to retrieve their belongings from the ship, and are now expected to be transported to temporary accommodation in local barracks in Bulimba, Brisbane.It is still hoped the ship can be repaired in time for it to attend a summit next month in Sydney, but this to be unlikely. A decision on whether to take her to Brisbane or Gladstone for repairs is expected to be made on Monday.The collision of a freight train with a passenger train just north of Cairo in the town of Shebin al-Qanater.  The accident claimed 5 lives and injured another 30.  It is reported that one of the dead was the engineer of the freight train.In August the director of rail service in Egypt was fired after a similar accident killed 58 people in the town of Qalyoub.  A public inquiry into that accident is underway amid growing criticism of the government for lax rail safety and transport regulation.  Mohammed Mansour, Egypt's new director of transport has agreed that the transportation system is in need of extensive overhauls.  The government has approved $860 million to develop the rail infrastructure, plus another $600 million in loans to private rail operators.At least 50 children have died as the result of a train and bus collision in the Asyut Governorate of Egypt. Governor Yehya Keshk has also said thirteen children were injured in the crash near the city of Manfalut, approximately 230 miles or 350 kilometres south of the Egyptian capital, Cairo.The bus was transporting approximately sixty pre-school children, with the fatalities aged between four and six, according to BBC News Online. Senior Health Ministry official Mamdouh al-Weshahi reported "several deaths and injuries among the pupils", who "are being counted and taken to hospitals".Speaking from Cairo, Al-Jazeera reporter Sherin Tadros said it was "difficult for the rescuers to operate in the area" as the seriousness of the accident meant "only 22 bodies or so came out in full and the rest are in [pieces]".Dr. Mohamed Samir reported witness accounts of the incident to Reuters news agency. "They told us the barriers were open when the bus crossed the tracks and the train collided with it," he said.State media has said, in the aftermath of this incident the Egyptian Railway Authority head and transport minister Rashad al-Metini have resigned.Fire broke out today at Egypt's Shura Council, the upper house of the Parliament of Egypt at around 16:00 local time. The number of casualties had reached 13 by 22:30. Officials said that most of the casualties were a result of smoke inhalation and minor burns."The fire is currently limited to the Shura Council's second floor. We are still trying to determine the exact cause of the fire," the official said. "Parliament is currently on summer recess and very few people would have been in the building."As of this article's publication, thick black clouds of smoke could still be seen billowing from the three-story building in downtown Cairo. A statement had been broadcast over a local TV network indicating that the evacuated employees said authorities told them they had ruled out terrorism and that the fire has been a result of a short circuit.Fire engines and military helicopters reached the fire location and began trying to extinguish the flames. Ambulances were also seen in the area. Parts of the ceiling on the top floor collapsed due to the fire.The Egyptian Taxation building had also caught on fire.An investigation has been commenced by Egypt into the Friday sinking of one of El Salam's passenger ferries in the Red Sea. M/V al-Salam Boccaccio 98 was carrying 1408, including many Egyptians returning from work in Saudi Arabia. The ship left from the port of Dubah in Saudi Arabia enroute to the port of Safaga in Egypt. On the west coast of Saudi Arabia during the night a sandstorm occurred due to high winds.David Osler of  Lloyd's List has said of the ship that "It's a roll-on, roll-off ferry, and there is big question mark over the stability of this kind of ship," he continued and said that "It would only take a bit of water to get on board this ship and it would be all over. ... The percentage of this type of ferry involved in this type of disaster is huge." Mamdouh Ismail, head of Al-Salaam Maritime Transport Company, stated that another one of El Salam's ferries, Saint Catherine received a distress call from one of the lifeboats of the Boccaccio when it arrived in Dubah from Safaga. The Saint Catherine notified its company headquarters, and El Salam reported it to Egyptian authorities.According to a statement given to the Associated Press by Ismail, the ferry was carrying 96 crew members, 1,200 Egyptians, and 112 other passengers. A Transport Ministry spokesman has stated that 314 people have been rescued. More than 185 bodies have been recovered from the sea according to an Egyptian police official who has requested anonymity.Four rescue ships from Egypt arrived Friday afternoon, approximately ten hours after the sinking of the 35-year-old ferry in the night near the Egyptian port of Hurghada. Aid from Britain and the United States was initially refused. Later, both the British HMS Bulwark and the US P3-Orion maritime naval patrol aircraft were recalled, but due to its distance at the later time, the request for the return of the Bulwark was called off by Egypt.At least forty people are reported to have died and another fifty are injured after an accident at a level crossing in Egypt. A truck failed to stop at the crossing near Marsa Matruh, pushing several vehicles waiting ahead of it onto the tracks. The train then struck the traffic that was in the way. Two carriages toppled on top of cars, and two more derailed. Thirty-five died at the scene, and five more were pronounced dead in hospital. The death toll has already risen from twenty after more bodies were recovered.Three vehicles were struck by the service from Matruh to Alexandria, and at least two were crushed underneath it. It is unclear whether the truck was amongst the vehicles hit, or if a bus was involved. A fifth carriage was detached from the train.Heavy equipment has been dispatched to the scene to remove the carriages, and dozens of emergency vehicles are present. It is feared that more bodies remain in the wreckage. It is unclear if the victims are all Egyptian or if anyone from abroad was on the train.An investigation has been launched into the disaster, but a witness said that the level crossing is hidden behind a hill, leaving drivers with little time to react.Eight children were taken to hospital on Friday after being struck by a car in Suffolk, England. 20 schoolchildren were out on an educational trip through the village of Worlingham in Suffolk, England at roughly 14:00 BST with a teacher and an assistant to supervise. They were being introduced to the local area  when a driver lost control of a Nissan Note and ploughed into the group of children, who were eight and nine years old. The accident occurred near a church where a funeral was taking place. Eight pupils had to be taken to hospital. Two of the victims were transported from the crash scene by air-ambulance. Another person suffered from two broken legs. The teacher was also injured. One girl is thought to have a broken pelvis.A spokeswoman for the paramedics said that three of the badly hurt children "went under the wheels of the car". A 21-year-old man was also hurt. He was on his way to the funeral, which was for a person who had died in a road traffic accident. Mike Croft, who is the principal of Worlingham Middle School, said: "You could not think of anything worse than finding children like that. It's not a day I want to repeat. When I got there, there was mayhem. It looked awful. Parents were informed as quickly as possible. Counsellors were called to the scene and subsequently attended the school."Andreas Djiakouris, supervisor of the paramedics, stated: "Every single one of our crews who were at the scene had their hands full from the minute they got there to the minute they left."  Three children are said to have been critically injured.It is thought that the Nissan driver hit the group of pedestrians while trying to avoid other parked cars. A 40-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.Eight people are dead and two more are missing and presumed dead after an explosion and fire on a cargo ship undergoing repairs at a naval dockyard in Kaliningrad, Russia.The container ship MV Yenisey was the scene of an explosion while in drydock at about 3:00 p.m. Moscow time (11:00 GMT). Ten people were missing after the explosion. It was confirmed today that the eighth body has been recovered, and the remaining two are thought to be dead as well. Three more were injured.Captain 1st Rank Igor Dygalo, acting as a navy spokesperson, said "Each family of the victims of the fire on the Yenisey civilian vessel will be paid more than a million rubles." This makes their compensation roughly equivalent to US$43,000.Dygolo said that the dockyard, in the closed military town of Baltiysk, near Kaliningrad, had been leased to the Yenisey's St Petersburg owner, a private company, who were conducting the work themselves. He said an investigation has been launched by the navy led by top admiral Vladimir Vysotsky.Vysotski himself has indicated that serious safety legislation breaches concerning welding regulations by both the vessel's owner and the naval dockyard's bosses. He did not go into details, but RIA Novosti claimed that a source at the dockyard said a gas burner applied to the roof of a fuel tank to heat and therefore loosen its bolts had triggered the disaster.Today is an official day of mourning for Kaliningrad Region to mark the deaths.An investigation is currently under way in Argyll, Scotland, following a derailment on the Glasgow – Oban railway.  The incident took place at 2100 BST (2000 UTC) on Sunday, close to the Falls of Cruachan station.  According to reports, both carriages of the derailed unit had also caught fire.  At the location of the incident, the railway line is on an embankment above a local roadway, and the lead car came to rest overhanging this road.All passengers have been successfully evacuated, with eight being taken to hospital with "serious but not life-threatening" injuries. There were no fatalities. A spokesperson for the ambulance service stated soon after the incident: "There's quite a lot of walking wounded. There's a couple of bumps to necks and backs and things like that."The British Transport Police gave a short statement:Inspector David McEwan being quoted as confirming that the lead coach was "sitting in a precarious position overhanging the roadway", and continued "the coach could slip further down the embankment on to the roadway [...] This is obviously a major concern for the engineers at this moment in time."Railway engineers are currently working to stabilise the site, and re-open the line. According to a Scotrail spokesperson "an investigation is already under way into the cause of the incident by appropriate agencies and industry partners".The line between Glasgow and Oban remains closed, with buses to Crianlarich and Oban replacing trains.Severe flooding in the island nation of Fiji has killed eight people and forced thousands to evacuate. The flooding is mainly in the western part of the country's main island, Viti Levu, where most of the resorts hosting international travellers are located. Fiji's National Disaster Office has advised all tourists still in the country to prepare for more bad weather and possibly more flooding.Fiji's chief of disaster management Aisea Qumihajelo said in a statement, "There's another depression heading toward Fiji within the next two days and that will bring an additional threat." The government of Fiji's military dictator Frank Bainimarama declared a state of emergency in the city of Nadi, the country's tourist centre, and other parts of western Viti Levu.Over 6,000 people have evacuated the area and are now in one of Fiji's 144 evacuation centers sheltered from the storm. Government sources have reported that at least six people have been killed by floodwaters, and two people were crushed by a landslide.The flood has affected many of the rural areas of the island, washing out sugar cane crops across the area and damaging roads and bridges. "Widespread flooding, including severe flooding of major rivers and streams, is expected on Wednesday and Thursday. The western division is likely to be worse affected once again," said Fiji's director of meteorology, Rajendra Prasad.Rescue efforts, led by the government and the Red Cross, have begun especially in rural and heavily-flooded areas. Vetaia Dokonivalu, a local resident from Ba, a hard-hit town, commented, "It was really frightening. We watched as the doors of our homes were forced open by the water. We saw our belongings being swept out of the houses."This flooding has also caused a food crisis in some parts. Isimeli Tukana, a health official, said, "People need to collect as much rainwater as possible and drink as much of this as possible. The other option is to boil the water. Watch out for food from supermarkets especially from the towns of Ba, Nadi, Sigatoka and Rakiraki. Our health inspectors will be doing their rounds as soon as the water goes down." According to the Fiji Retailers Association, the storm has caused over a million dollars worth of damage to Fiji's businesses.At least eight people have been killed in the Russian province of Dagestan after an ambush by rebels, according to reports. The incident occurred in the Sergokalinsky district last night about 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala, when workers were being dispatched to fix a cell phone tower owned by the "Beeline" (Билайн) telecommunications company. The tower had earlier been damaged by bomb blasts by rebels. When driving up to the tower, the convoy of workers, accompanied by police officers, came under fire. "According to preliminary information, an attack was made on a car with policemen. Eight people in the vehicle were killed. Other passengers received injuries or concussions," said a source with the security force of the Sergokalinsky district.The Dagestan province frequently sees violence, blamed on gangs and separatists supposedly inspired by rebels in neighbouring Chechnya.Rescue crews have called an end to the search for eight mountaineers who went missing on the French side of Mont Blanc after an avalanche that occurred on at 0100 GMT August 24. Eight other climbers were also injured. Five of the missing are said to be Austrian and three were from Switzerland."[There is] no longer any chance of finding someone alive," stated the interior minister of France, Michele Alliot-Marie who also added that are more people trapped beneath the snow. "Thanks to technology, we know for certain there are people buried under the snow, but it's impossible to be sure exactly how many." Rescuers feared that there would be more avalanches and decided to end the search for survivors in the late afternoon today. The avalanche started at an elevation of 3,600 meters and went down the mountainside for nearly 100 meters, leaving a trail 50 meters wide. Rescuers used helicopters and dogs to search for survivors for a day, but failed to find any."[I saw] a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres," said one of the survivors from Italy, Marco Delfini who also said he tried to help the others caught in the snow.There have been many accidents in the Alps this summer, about one hundred climbers have perished since June 1 in France, Italy and Switzerland altogether, of whom about twenty have died on Mont Blanc.Victoria Stafford, eight years old, was sighted leaving her Woodstock, Ontario school on Wednesday afternoon with an unknown woman caught on video camera.  She has not been seen since.Victoria (Tori) attended grade 3 at Oliver Stephens Public School, and the video is from the College Avenue secondary school as Victoria and the unidentified woman walked along Fyfe Avenue."I've had a lot of problems come up in my life and stuff like that, and I haven't always been there for my kids, but this is my baby girl and it's absolutely hurting now," her father Robert Stafford said, "It's killing me, [I want to] let her know that I love her and I'll see her soon. One way or another I'll see her soon."Police teams from Oxford, Waterloo and London have assembled together with rescue dogs and trained search and rescue personnel to find the child.Police have called the search a criminal investigation, but have not yet issued an Amber alert as there has been no report of an abduction.150 volunteers joined search efforts and to pass out flyers on the 10th. Police say they have no need of more volunteers at this time, however they would appreciate any tips or calls from anyone who may have seen either Victoria or the woman.  The unidentified woman seen in the video is described as between 19 and 25 years old with straight long black hair. She weighs about 120 to 125 pounds and was wearing a white coat and black jeans in the video. Victoria was wearing a green shirt with a black pleated skirt. She was wearing black and white shoes and carried a purple and pink Bratz purse. She had on a black Hannah Montana jacket which had a white fur lined hood."I think what's happening with members of the public is an expression of their emotions, their concern for this child. And I think that's good in terms of the willingness of this community to step up," said  Michael Harding, Mayor of Woodstock.Volunteers are making and handing out purple ribbons, Tori's favourite colour. A candlelight vigil will be held in the evening on Easter Sunday.According to state television, at least eighteen people have been killed and a further six injured after an explosion at a coal mine in central China.The incident occurred during the afternoon on Friday April 17 at the Qingshanbei mine in Chenzhou city, located in the Hunan province. An employee for the city's coal industry bureau told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency that an explosives warehouse and detonator exploded, saying that "up to this morning we have confirmed there are 18 dead and three injured."The Xinhua News Agency reports that two other people had been reported missing after the explosion. Police have suggested that the explosives may have been stored illegally.China is reported to have some of the world's most dangerous mines. Official reports state that no less than 3,786 miners were killed in accidents in the country in 2007. The safety record has been slightly improving, however, as the death toll for 2008 saw a fifteen percent drop, with 3,215 miner deaths from accidents. The decrease was in part, due to a crackdown on unsafe mines by the authorities. The actual death toll may be higher, however, as many legally-operated mines frequently do not report or hide fatalities in order not to be suspended from operating by the government.Eleven days, or 266 hours after an earthquake in Sichuan Province in China which killed over 60,000 people, a survivor has been rescued from the rubble of his own house in the city of Mianzhu. Xiao Zhihu, 80, who is said to be in stable condition at a local hospital, was paralyzed prior to the earthquake and was found underneath a pillar that once held up his house. Officials said that the only reason he survived so long was because he was being fed by his wife.At least 30,000 people are missing as a result of the magnitude 7.9 quake on May 12. Officials fear the death toll could go above 80,000. The quake's epicenter was located in the Aba prefecture, 90 kilometers (55 miles) west, northwest of Chengdu, Sichuan, China and was recorded at a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).This was the largest earthquake to strike the region in almost 60 years. The deadliest quake in China's history was of magnitude 7.8, striking Tangshan in 1976. Approximately 250,000 people were killed. On May 23, a man who survived that quake after being buried for 10 days, was found alive in the rubble of an office building in Beichuan. He was the only survivor.File:Minsk-Metro-Oktyabrskaya-08.jpgEleven people are reported dead and more than a hundred injured after a bomb went off in a Minsk Metro station in Minsk, Belarus on Monday evening.According to witnesses, the explosion happened just after a train entered the Oktyabrskaya station at about 1755 local time (1555 UTC).  The explosion reportedly damaged the station, with a section of the ceiling having collapsed.

President Alexander Lukashenko said police forces are to "turn the country upside down" to determine who was responsible.The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear, though police are saying that terrorist activity was responsible. "We must find out who gained by undermining peace and stability in the country, who stands behind this," Lukashenko said. "Who did not like the stability in Belarus?"At least eleven people have died in a crash between a van and a tractor-trailer on Interstate 65 south of Munfordville, Kentucky. The collision occurred around 5:16 a.m. CDT (1016 UTC) yesterday morning near the 63-mile marker.According to officials the tractor-trailer crossed the median and struck the 18 passenger van head-on. The truck then hit a rock wall and burst into flames. The driver of the truck is reported to have died along with ten passengers in the van.  The family in the van were Mennonites from Kentucky on their way to a wedding in Iowa.Officials said that one infant was killed but two other children in the van aged four and five that were in child restraint seats survived with minor injuries.

Eleven of the forty passengers trying to cross the Nile River drowned when the boat sank."Police said the accident was caused by the severity of the current and the overloading of the boat," a police statement said. "People on the island said they had not seen an incident like it for more than 40 years."Forty farmers, along with their goods, had boarded the boat, overloading it. State ministers from Khartoum, the commissioner of Karrary district, and the police visited Islanj Island following the accident.File:Swan Hill3.jpgEleven people have been killed, and more than 20 injured, when a V/Line passenger train and a semi trailer collided at a level crossing on the Murray Valley Highway in northern Victoria, Australia. At least 13 more are still missing and are believed to be trapped in the wreckage.The collision, which occurred at 1:40 p.m. local time, was approximately 10 km north of the town of Kerang, on the Swan Hill railway line.The train involved in the accident was a service from Swan Hill, which departed at 1:00 p.m. from Swan Hill railway station, and was destined for Melbourne. The train was comprised of a locomotive and three carriages.Witness reports say that the semi-trailer collided into the second of the three carriages, and then detached the third carriage from the remainder of the train and causing it to derail.  The whole side of the second carriage was ripped open from the direct impact of the semi-trailer. The injured have been transferred from the scene to hospitals in the area, including Kerang and Mildura, by ambulance. Helicopters and light aircraft have been used to transfer patients to Melbourne, as local hospitals struggle with the sudden influx of patients. The driver of the semi-trailer has been moved to the hospital in Mildura in "critical condition", according to police at the scene.The train had 39 people on board the 1:00 p.m. service, according to train documents. This included three staff employed by the train operator V/Line, who have all been accounted for and are not injured. Of the 36 passengers on the train, it has been reported that 23 have suffered injuries.Reports say six people were airlifted to Melbourne for treatment, however one has since died. The remaining 17 have been moved to regional hospitals, including the temporary relief centre in Kerang, according to a Rural Ambulance Service spokesperson.Although there are still 13 people unaccounted for, police say it is possible that some had bought tickets and were therefore listed on the train manifest, but did not end up catching the service.Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks is expected to fly to the crash scene this evening. He has ordered a full investigation into the incident. Federal Minister for Transport Mark Vaile has offered Federal government assistance from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to help with the investigation. The Prime Minister John Howard has offered the Victorian government any additional aid that is requires in the aftermath of this incident.A Honda, with eleven-year-old Jose Covarrubias behind the wheel, ran a stop sign in Porterville, California colliding with a Ford around 7:30 P.M.The eastbound 1993 Honda was sideswiped from the driver's side by a southbound 1999 Ford, killing Jose.  His sister, 6-year-old Elizabeth Covarrubias, and mother, Maria Covarrubias, were killed when they ejected, as they were not wearing seatbelts.  Family  friend Froylon Gonzalez was sent to the hospital with serious injuries, and the driver of the Ford, Charles Seguin, sustained minor injuries.Felipe Gonzalez, Froylon's brother, said the family was returning from Jose's soccer team practice. He also added that he had never seen Jose drive before. Gonzales was the lone survivor of the Honda and has not yet been interviewed.The accident occurred at a rural intersection and it did not appear to law enforcement that drugs, alcohol, or weather were a factor in the collision.The bodies will be buried in Mexico near where the father lives.An Air New Zealand Beechcraft performed an emergency landing at Blenheim after being diverted from its destination following a landing gear problem.The Beechcraft 1900D was being flown by Eagle Air, a subsidiary of Air New Zealand, flying from Timaru to Wellington with 15 passengers and two air crew on board.When arriving at Wellington, the landing gear would not lower, forcing flight NZ 2300 to be diverted to the RNZAF Base Woodbourne, Blenheim where it landed on its belly at around 9.00 a.m.. The plane was badly damaged, and immediately covered in foam as is standard policy and as a safety precaution.The air base was expected to be closed for around two hours as cranes cleaned up the wreckage.Eagle Air General Manager, Doug Roberts said that their initial assessment is that the crew did an excellent job, and executed a text book wheels up landing. "Our pilots undergo some of the most extensive training in the industry and dealing with emergency situations like this is a cornerstone of their training."A man from Wellington on board with his son and partner, said that he was a bit "freaked out", but was fine after the landing, praising the landing performed by the experienced pilot.Marty Solomon says that all passengers were informed throughout the journey of what was happening, and were well prepared for the crash landing.Two of the passengers, one of whom was pregnant, were sent to hospital for check ups.A special support crew is now being flown to Blenheim by Air New Zealand to help those affected by today's emergency landing. They say that most of the passengers will now continue the rest of their journey today.Eagle Air and the Transport Accident Investigation Commission will now investigate the incident.Eagle flies 17 other Beechcraft, and service by those planes is continuing as normal today, as they are considered to be extremely reliable.The San Jose, California fire department and Hazardous Materials crews today responded to a chemical emergency at a JDS Uniphase manufacturing facility. The incident, at 80 Rose Orchard Drive, off North First St., sent between 15 and 17 people, including two firefighters, to the hospital with symptoms and for observation.  Those exposed to the hazard reported a smell of "burnt rubber", along with symptoms of eye and throat irritation.  Over 48 others were held in a nearby building while the incident was assessed.  Rose Orchard Way was closed for much of the day while emergency crews responded.  Estimates put the incident at about 10 a.m. (1800 UTC).  As of 6 p.m. television news reports, authorities still had not determined the source or nature of the chemical, but said neighboring buildings were not in danger.  JDS Uniphase manufactures fiber optic communications and test equipment, and was formed from a merger of JDS FITEL and Uniphase Corporation in 1999.The president of El Salvador declared a national emergency in his country today, after torrential rains, flooding, and landslides inundated the area.Mauricio Funes said that the situation was "a tragedy", and that the amount of damage suffered by the country was "incalculable". "Today is a very sad day for the country and its government, in fact it is one of the most tragic days in memory," he said in a televised speech on Sunday.Rescue teams, residents, and the armed forces are digging through mud and rubble around the country to try and find survivors and bodies. Recovery efforts were made difficult due to clogged roads and destroyed bridges.According to the El Salvadorian Interior Minister, Humbero Centeno, at least 130 people had died from mudslides and flooding across the country, and a further 13,680 had lost their homes. The BBC reports that the torrential rains were likely caused by a low pressure weather system in the Pacific, possibly related to Hurricane Ida, which passed near the area earlier.The Interior Minister noted that the death toll will probably rise in the near future, as rescue efforts continue and many people are still missing. "There are 60 people missing in just the province of San Vicente [...] we have been through disaster zones, including a fly-over of Verapaz [in San Vicente], it is a real tragedy there," he said.Rains started falling in El Salvador on Saturday, as the storm passed over the country, causing rivers to flood their banks and initiating mudslides. Ida, now downgraded to a tropical storm, is expected to head to the Gulf Coast and southern areas of the United States next.The government of Peru declared a state of emergency in the vicinity of the Ubinas volcano on Saturday as it began to spew out ash and smoke over a 6km area, indicating a possible eruption in the near future. The civil defense institute has recommended the total evacuation of the 3,500 residents of the district of Ubinas.The Peruvian military has been ordered to aid in the evacuation of civilians from the area. Aid shipments of tents, water and powdered milk are being sent to the affected area.Those who decided to evacuate were brought to the town of Querapi by bus. Others who reside near the volcano chose to stay behind to protect their livestock and belongings. No human deaths have been reported so far, but llamas and alpacas have died after eating grass contaminated by volcanic pollutants. People have reported eye and breathing problems following exposure to the acid-laden ash and smoke. The 18700-ft. high Ubinas is Peru's most active volcano, with 23 eruptions recorded since 1550. The current activity follows a 40-year dormant period. Scientists at the Institute of Geophysics have warned that a dome of incandescent lava appears to be building up in the volcanic crater.A state of emergency was declared Sunday for the U.S. state of Washington by governor Christine Gregoire, as additional reports of storm-related casualties surfaced. The state National Guard has been deployed to aid in distributing supplies.Thousands were still without power in the coastal and Puget Sound regions, though most urban areas were back with power  as late as Sunday afternoon, and outages were mostly contained to rural and unincorporated areas. Puget Sound Energy reported that roughly 500,000 energy customers out of the 700,000 who lost power were back in service by Sunday evening. Seattle City Light, the city's independent municipal utility, reported only 18,000 customers still without power as of Monday morning, down from a peak of 175,000.Four additional deaths related to the post-storm power outage had been reported as of Monday, bringing the total number of casualties to eight. A man in Gig Harbor was electrocuted by a downed power line while walking his dog. Another man in Spanaway died when an unattended candle caused a house fire.Two died from carbon monoxide poisoning in separate incidents related to use of combustion devices indoors. Roughly a hundred additional cases of non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning were reported from people using generators or grills indoors. News radio stations and authorities warned the public to stay away from downed power lines and not to use grills indoors. Dr. Neil Hampson at Virginia Mason's hyperbaric unit, where a number of victims were being treated, warned it could be "the worse case of carbon monoxide poisioning in the country".On Monday, four new carbon-monoxide deaths were reported in a family of five in Burien due to an indoor generator. In Canada, which had some damage from the week's storms, two southern British Columbia carbon monoxide deaths were also reported. Despite continued warnings, hospitals are still seeing cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, including a family in w:Shoreline, Washington which was taken to the hospital after they reported symptoms due to their indoor grill. Neighbors of the Burien family suggested that noise concerns are leading people to place noisy generators indoors.The massive power outage left many stores and gas stations unable to operate. Some businesses opened with the help of backup generators, conserving power by foregoing heat and refrigeration, exterior lighting, and half the interior lighting. Most stores had run out of "D" size batteries, the most common size for flashlights, as well as firelogs and other essentials. Gasoline shortages were reported throughout the area, with one man selling excess fuel for as high as $15 per gallon, over 5 times the average retail price. The Red Cross set up shelters throughout King and other affected counties for those without power or food. Hotels reported no vacancies as whole families took shelter in powered hotels, especially in Seattle. Restaurants also reported brisk business as people sought out a hot cooked meal. Tons of perishable food were expected to have become unsafe after the prolonged outage disabled refrigerators and freezers both in homes and stores.Many of those without power visited nearby friends and family living where power had been continued or restored, while others traveled out of the area to places that had not been affected. The widespread outage made long-distance traveling treacherous on some major routes, with roadway lighting, cellular towers, and services disabled by the outage.Most major roadways which were closed during the storm were reopened on Friday. The 520 Floating Bridge over Lake Washington, a major conduit to the technology-rich Eastside, sustained minor damage. Amtrak, which had halted its Cascades service, resumed Saturday evening. Sea-Tac Airport resumed operations with a reduced flight load, after a transient power outage on Friday disabled the airport radar and caused all planes to be grounded until it was repaired.Sikorsky S92A helicopters are expected to be grounded until the mounting stud on the main gearbox filter bowl are changed. Following examination of the wreckage from a Canadian helicopter crash, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is developing an emergency safety directive for operators of similar Sikorsky helicopters to change titanium studs to steel studs before any S-92A helicopters can take to the air again.Cougar Helicopters Flight 91 crashed into the north Atlantic Ocean last Friday, March 13, killing 17 of the 18 people on board. All bodies were recovered Tuesday and they have been released by the coroner to their families. The voice and flight data recorders have been retrieved and are in good condition. They have been sent to Ottawa for examination by aviation officials.Mr. Robert Decker was the only survivor and has not recovered enough to speak with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). "Mr. Decker was back in the fuselage and what happened during the occurrence, happened in the cockpit and Mr. Decker wouldn't be privy to that. But on the issue of survivability, he may be able to help with that," said Dave Cunningham, of the Transportation Safety Board.A review of immersion suit standards of the two year old suits worn during this trip is being called for by the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Danny Williams. Williams is also urging for a review of offshore safety procedures, including placement of search and rescue aircraft closer to the capital.  The final report on the crash will take about a year to compile, however Cunningham will speak to the media at the end of next week.The United States Federal Aviation Administration has issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive to all owners and operators of certain Next Generation Boeing 737s to inspect their aircraft in light of recent developments in the investigation of the recent China Airlines explosion.The measures have been imposed due to the discovery that a structural bolt in the aircraft that exploded had come loose and punched a hole in the aircraft's right wing fuel tank.It is thought the bolt came loose after a worker failed to replace a washer after a routine maintenance procedure several months prior to the accident.Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx said "This was determined to be an issue of flight safety... It's very, very important."Operators must complete an initial inspection of the wing slat assemblies of the affected aircraft in ten days, and must ensure the fasteners are properly torqued within 24 days. They must then repeat the inspections every 3,000 flight cycles thereafter. The directive is believed to affect over 2,000 aircraft worldwide.According to officials, an Airbus A340 jetliner registered to the Emirates airline struck its tail upon the runway as it took off from Melbourne Airport in Melbourne, Australia Saturday. More than 225 people were on board.Flight EK407, which had departed for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, had to circle around the airport for 45 minutes, dumping fuel, before making an emergency landing.There were no reports of injuries, although some of the runway lights were knocked out during the incident."It [the aeroplane] took off very steeply, the tail touched the end of the runway, and it went up, stabilised and came back," a Melbourne Airport spokesman told the Agence France-Presse news agency.One passenger, Catherine Edmunds, described the event at terrifying while speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation."We did land successfully, thankfully, and the plane was surrounded by paramedics and fire engines. It was terrifying," Edmunds said. "I'd hate to go through it again."The Emirates airline stated that they had dispatched a safety team to Melbourne to investigate the accident.Aviation authorities from Australia also launched their own investigation. Ian Brokenshire, a spokesman for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, announced that "we will be looking at the flight data records, getting data off that, interviewing the crew, interviewing the company representatives, inspecting the runway and aircraft."The plane's passengers were given alternate flights to Dubai.On Wednesday, an Emirates Boeing 777 crash-landed in Dubai with 282 passengers and 18 crew on board, according to the airline. This resulted in the death of a firefighter, Jasim Issa Mohammed Hassan, who died fighting the fire at the crash. The Director-General of the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority, Saif Al Suwaidi, praised Jasim Issa Mohammed Hassan's sacrifice in saving hundreds of passengers.According to passenger accounts, the pilot announced an emergency landing minutes before the crash. Then the airliner, flight EK52, was engulfed in smoke at landing and soon after burst into flames. Passengers spoke of their fear. The airport was shut down for four hours after the incident and all crew members and passengers on the flight from India were accounted for and safe, with fourteen reported hospitalised with minor injuries.The cause of the crash has not been officially announced, however reports indicate the plane's landing gear may not have deployed as the plane landed. An aviation safety consultant, in remarks to Australia's ABC News, noted safely and efficiently evacuating all the passengers was a significant achievement, considering the size of the aircraft.The airline said two people on the flight were Australian, eleven from the United Arab Emirates, 24 from the the UK, and 226 from India. The co-pilot of the crashed plane was an Australian with approximately 7,000 hours flying experience, according to Emirates chairman Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who also said the crash was not due to any fault in security.On Friday evening, an explosion in Chengdu, China caused partial shutdown of a facility operated by Foxconn, one of the world's biggest electronics manufacturers and a major supplier to companies like Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Sony, Apple, Motorola and Nokia. Initial investigations now suggest the explosion was caused by poor ventilation, which lead to high concentrations of combustible dust.The blast happened at 7:18PM, around the time workers change shifts. A fire followed. Emergency services had control by 7:30PM. At least three people were killed, at least fifteen injured. Foxconn halted production to investigate, saying "All operations at the affected workshop remain suspended and production at all other workshops that carry out similar processing functions have also been halted pending the results of the investigation. All other production operations in our facilities in China continue operating normally."On Monday, city officials gave the cause as combustible dust in the air at a polishing workshop. Hong Kong-based labor rights group Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior said they reported aluminium dust problems in March when they reviewed working conditions at Foxconn. After the explosion, they commented that workers were complaining "the ventilation of the department is poor. Workers polish the iPad cases to make them shiny. In the process, there is lots of aluminum (aluminium) dust floating in the air. Workers always breathe in aluminum dust even though they put on masks. When workers take off their cotton gloves, their hands are covered with aluminum dust."Foxconn responded by saying the group was trying  to "capitalize on the tragic accident" and misrepresented "Foxconn's commitment to the health and safety of our employees."Foxconn is responsible for making iPads and iPhones for Apple. Research group IHS iSuppli said the explosion may cause loss of production of 500,000 iPads during this quarter of the year. They said there is a larger facility in Shenzhen, but it cannot cope with re-compensating the possible loss.A fire broke out earlier today at an Airlines ramp control tower at the Miami International Airport. The building is currently being constructed. The fire is believed to have been sparked by hot roofing tar that spilled. The building is part of an expansion at the airport.There fire is confined to the upper deck of the tower. There are no reports of flight delays because of the fire.According to the chief of the agency investigating the Turkish Airlines aeroplane crash at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands yesterday, engine trouble may have been a factor in the accident.Addressing Dutch state television, chairman of the Dutch Safety Board Pieter van Vollenhoven said that the way the aircraft dropped from the air suggests that the engines may have failed. "If you then lose speed, you then literally fall out of the sky," he said. However, he noted that the reason for the apparent engine failure had not yet been established.Van Vollenhoven said that the analysis of the aeroplane's flight data recorders could be finished as early as Tuesday, but added that the Dutch Safety Board would most likely not disclose any preliminary findings until next week.Fred Sanders, a spokesman for the board, said that the damage to the aircraft corroborated witness accounts that the plane impacted with the ground tail-down."This may indicate that the plane had lost its forward momentum, that there was no motor function," he said, adding that it may be be a long time before a full explanation of the accident is available. "We will have an official finding probably in about a year, but we should be able to give an interim finding within weeks," he said.Nine people were killed and 86 injured on Wednesday when a Boeing 737-800 with 135 people on board registered to Turkish Airlines crashed just short of the runway in a farmer's field near Schiphol Airport.Very early Wednesday morning, an engineer was killed while working at Waterloo station in the British capital London. Emergency services received the call at about 2:20 a.m. local time (0120 UTC), according to British Transport Police (BTP), but the man was found dead at the scene. He was working on a travelator — a moving walkway — at the station when the incident occurred.Waterloo station is in central London and is part of the London Underground mass transit system. London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade were the first responders and already there when BTP arrived, by BTP's report. The man was a 44-year-old contract worker from Cambridgeshire, England.The travelator allows passengers to transfer between the Northern and Jubilee lines of the Underground. Transport for London (TfL) told morning rush-hour passengers to take a longer way around instead of the travelator.BTP started an investigation of the death, which they treated as not suspicious but unexplained. Detective Inspector Darren Gough said, "This is a truly tragic incident, and our deepest condolences are with the man’s family." An official from TfL stated: "We are working with colleagues in the British Transport Police following an incident at Waterloo station in the early hours of this morning."The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, gave his condolences via Twitter, adding, "An urgent enquiry into what happened is underway to ensure it cannot happen again."On Monday morning at approximately 7:00 am BST (UTC+1) fire fighters arrived at the Weston-super-Mare Grand Pier in North Somerset, England, which had caught fire.No one was injured in the blaze, which destroyed the pier. Firefighters said they believe the fire started in an area containing deep fat fryers. Smoke could be seen as far away as ten miles."Indications are that there were some deep fat fryers in the area where we believe the fire first started," said chief fire officer Kevin Pearson. "We're fairly clear about where we think the fire first started and obviously our investigations will concentrate on that area." A local hotel operator described the fire as an "inferno" and said of the pier: "It is part of our identity and would really affect trade if we were to lose it."The owner of the pier bought it in February of this year, but was in Spain on holiday at the time of the fire. "He is absolutely devastated," said spokeperson Nigel Heath. "He had a huge personal involvement in the project and was totally committed to it."The loss of the pier could affect the resort town of Weston-super-Mare. The Grand Pier itself employed around 100 people, but other businesses also depended on it as an attraction."I'm absolutely gutted. This is going to affect us massively. I just felt shivers down my spine. There's nothing left now - Weston's doomed," said Nicky Mager who runs a family business of donkey rides and refreshment outlets in the seafront town.An USAR team is evaluating if anything can be saved from the pier. The remains are not expected to collapse into the sea as they are on steel girders."The USAR team are going there to see if there is anything they can do to help secure the pier," said Avon Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Helen Shrimpton. "I can say that the pier was all locked up when we arrived and we needed bolt croppers and an angle-grinder to get in." She also said that investigators are keeping an open mind to the possibility of arson.This is the second time the Grand Pier, first built in 1904, has been destroyed by fire. In 1930 it burnt down, after which it re-opened in 1933.Fire broke out at London Zoo on Saturday morning, severely damaging a cafe and shop and killing an aardvark. Zoo officials said four meerkats were missing and were also presumed to be dead.The fire, mostly in the Animal Adventure cafe and shop, also spread to a nearby petting area. Reportedly, 72 firefighters with ten fire engines fought the blaze for about three hours starting shortly after 6:00 am to bring it under control. A spokesperson for the Fire Brigade stated that when they arrived, the fire was already "very well developed". According to the ambulance service, two people were treated for minor injuries, six for smoke inhalation, with one taken to hospital. A statement from the zoo said, regarding animal fatalities, "Sadly our vets have confirmed the death of our nine-year-old aardvark, Misha. There are also four meerkats unaccounted for at this stage, and we have limited access to site to confirm this." Other animals were said to be apparently unaffected.The zoo reported quick response by zoo security guards and by animal care staff who are housed at the zoo, which is in Regents Park; they moved animals to safety. A dog walker, Adnan Abdul Husein, told the BBC he had first noticed heavy smoke and alerted zoo security guards.Zoo officials initially said the zoo would be closed "until further notice" but later announced it would reopen today, Christmas Eve.A fire on Sunday night in the seven-storey carpark for the Echo Arena in Liverpool, England destroyed almost all the vehicles parked inside and led to cancellation of the final evening of the Liverpool International Horse Show and evacuation of nearby blocks of flats. The blaze reportedly started with a parked Range Rover Discovery.Investigators with the fire brigade stated that they believe the fire began with an accidental engine fire in the Range Rover at about 4.30 pm. The first call was made at 4.42 and firefighters arrived eight minutes after that. Ultimately twelve engines and 85 firefighters were involved in combatting the blaze. Aerial appliances were used and also three high-volume pumps. Fed by the fuel in vehicles parked inside, the temperature of the fire in the carpark is believed to have reached as high as 1,000°C. It was too hot to be extinguished with water from hydrants, so a high-volume pump was used to draw water from the River Mersey, and two more were brought from other fire brigades in the region.The carpark has seven storeys and a capacity of 1,600 vehicles, and approximately 1,300  were parked in it when the fire broke out. According to Dan Stephens, chief fire officer for Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, almost all of them were destroyed, with the exception of a few parked on the top level and at corners. "With these very high temperatures, you were never going to put the fire out without the whole building taking hold. The speed at which the fire spreads means you simply aren’t going to put it out," said Stephens.The carpark itself was severely damaged; according to Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool. It is not in danger of collapsing but will have to be demolished, which will be difficult with the many burned-out cars still inside it, Anderson told the BBC.According to Stephens, there were no serious injuries: one woman injured her hand, and two people were treated for smoke inhalation. A spokesman for the Echo Arena also stated that all animals were safe. All horses were successfully evacuated from the carpark and then removed from the stables after smoke spread to them. Six dogs were also rescued unharmed, two on a lower level in the early stages of the fire and four that had been left in a car on the top level, freed by firefighters on Monday after the fire was put out.The final evening of the four-day Liverpool International Horse Show had been scheduled to begin at 7.30, and had to be cancelled. Many attendees were stranded in the city on New Year's Eve night. Merseyside police directed people to the Pullman Hotel, where Red Cross assistance was available, and the Liverpool City Council set up an assistance centre at the Lifestyles Gym. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers has said that insurance companies will "move very quickly" to reimburse owners whose vehicles were destroyed.Nearby blocks of flats were evacuated because of the smoke. Eyewitnesses reported hearing what they at first thought were firecrackers, then "multiple explosions", "bangs and popping", "the bangs of car windows exploding". People reported leaving everything in their cars, including their cellphones, and running for their lives.Mayor Anderson tweeted that cuts to fire services over the last two years made it significantly harder to fight the fire and might have caused it not to be controllable. He also suggested that fire safety in multi-storey carparks had not been sufficiently considered and that installing sprinklers in them might help stop future fires before they become unmanageable, in a letter to Nick Hurd, a member of Parliament.A fire yesterday afternoon killed five girls, all aged fifteen, at an escape room the group was visiting to celebrate a birthday in Koszalin, North Poland. Following the fire, which also seriously injured a man, authorities are performing checks on all the nation's escape rooms.Escape rooms see participants locked into a space and given clues and a time limit to figure out how to free themselves. The enterprises have grown in popularity in recent years with reportedly over 1,000 in Poland which are especially patronised by teens.President Andrzej Duda said the victims were "joyful girls starting out in life [who] have had life torn away from them" in an "appalling tragedy" while Interior Minister Joachim Brudziński wrote he had ordered fire safety checks on escape rooms across Poland by the State Fire Brigade. He tweeted, "I want to express my sympathy and regrets to the families of the victims of the fire". Duda also characterised the deaths as "crushing" and wrote "May God protect their parents and loved ones."Tomasz Kubiak, a fire service spokesman, told Agence France-Presse the male victim is in intensive care with "severe burns". Police press officer Monika Kosiec stated police believe him to be aged 25. Kosiec revealed police have been unable to question him. State press agency PAP has reported being told off the record all five deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning.In addition to the inspections Brudzinski also ordered the installation of safety improvements at the facilities. Mayor of Koszalin Piotr Jedlinski has declared tomorrow a day of mourning.Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, yesterday said the revealed leaking of an estimated 300 metric tons of radioactive water at the damaged Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant was a "serious incident", level three on the seven-part international scale.Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), who run the plant, announced the leak last week and the new accident's level-three rating was made after consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, the Nuclear Regulation Authority notes this estimate may be overstated as it relies on the leaking tank being full before the leak began.There is no gauge to measure water quantities inside the tank, used to store contaminated water after the initial accident. Water is being collected at a rate of 400 tons per day, and an unknown quantity of radioactive groundwater is flowing into the sea. Industry minister Toshimitsu Motegi has already announced increased governmental supervision of TEPCO's leak mitigation after two other leaks this year. Motegi said TEPCO's antileak methods were like "whack-a-mole". Nuclear Regulation Authority disaster taskforce leader Shinji Kinjo has said TEPCO fails to document inspections and is poor at monitoring the tanks on the site. TEPCO staff had said water levels in the tank had remained constant.Shunichi Tanaka, head of the Nuclear Regulation Authority, said "We have no idea whether it's actually 300 tons that leaked. We need to look into this issue more." TEPCO initially said the leak was small when it was found in July and the watchdog gave it a level one "anomaly" rating at the time. Inspectors now say radiation below this tank stands at 100 millisieverts per hour, and another at the facility has a level of 70 millisieverts per hour."One hundred millisieverts per hour is equivalent to the limit for accumulated exposure over five years for nuclear workers; so it can be said that we found a radiation level strong enough to give someone a five-year dose of radiation within one hour," said TEPCO boss Masayuki Ono last week. TEPCO shares dropped yesterday by 2.6% to 497 yen.An oil spill in north-west Estonia has, according to scientists in the country, killed an estimated 5,000 birds across the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.The oil spill, which occurred on January 31, killed 2,000 birds just off the coasts of the nearby Vormsi and Osmussaar islands. Finnish authorities have also reported that birds in the Nordic countries have also been affected.The oil spill occurred on the coast of the northern Harjumaa region of Estonia, and has been credited to a Liberian tanker heading toward Singapore. By the end of the first 24 hours following the spill, authorities had already picked up 400 dead birds, killed by contact with the oil.The coasts of Estonia have historically been a Winter flocking place for birds from across North and Central Europe, due to the suitable climate for many species. The spill could endanger numbers, especially if the death toll continues to increase in the next few days.Ethiopian Airlines Flight 409, scheduled to fly from Beirut, Lebanon, to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia crashed into the Mediterranean Sea shortly after taking off Monday morning. Ethiopian Airlines report 83 people on board.Flight ET409, a Boeing 737, was set to leave at 2:10 am local time, but was delayed until 2:35. The passenger plane took off in stormy conditions, and it disappeared from radar five minutes later. Eyewitnesses reported a ball of fire as the plane went down. Debris has already been seen off the Lebanese coast.Rescue efforts are underway amid continuing heavy rains. However, it is unknown if there are any survivors. Among the passengers are 23 Ethiopian, 51 Lebanese, 1 Turkish, 1 French, 2 British, 1 Russian, 1 Canadian, 1 Syrian, 1 Iraqi nationals. The French embassy also stated that the wife of the French ambassador to Lebanon was on board.Lebanon's Transport Minister Ghazi al-Aridi said that the crash site "has been identified three-and-a-half km west of the village of Na'ameh".The European Union banned all of Indonesia's air carriers yesterday, none of which presently operate services to Europe, as well as several from Russia, Ukraine and Angola. They are the latest additions to the already extensive List of air carriers banned in the EU. The ban is scheduled to come into effect on July 6. Just hours after the ban a Boeing 737 operated by one of the blacklisted airlines, TAAG Angola Airlines, crashed into a house during landing, causing at least six fatalities in Northern Angola.Indonesia currently has 51 airlines, having grounded several and revoked the licences of others on June 25. The EU said that substandard maintenance and operation and a slow reaction by Indonesia to solve the problem were the main causes of the ban. EU holidaymakers who have booked flights with banned airlines via travel agents will be refunded for the services. EU transport commissioner Jacques Barrot said of the ban "Once more, the EU blacklist will prove to be an essential tool not only to prevent unsafe airlines from flying to Europe and to inform passengers travelling worldwide, but also to make sure that airlines and civil aviation authorities take appropriate actions to improve safety."Operations and safety editor at Flight International David Learmount commented that Indonesia, whose airline industry was deregulated the early 1990s, is one of a handful of cases where deregulation has lowered safety standards instead of improving them, saying of the move by the EU "Standards in aviation safety have been going up dramatically on a worldwide basis, but there are still places where they are [of the standards of] the 70s and 80s. In Indonesia the safety watchdog was told earlier this year to pull its socks up, but the EU is clearly convinced that it has not done so." One unnamed EU official was reported by The Guardian to have described Indonesia's civil aviation authority as "not very reliable", referring to a lack of reaction to warnings of an imminent ban and requests that Indonesia reassured officials that the problem was being dealt with. Indonesia has responded to the ban by saying that, according to information unseen by the EU, Indonesian safety standards are rising. Director-general of civil aviation at the Indonesian transport ministry Budhi Mulyawan Suyitno told Reuters new agency that, "Our data can show them that we have improved on every line. The US had already downgraded Indonesia's safety rating earlier this year.Also affected by the bans are Ukraine's Volare Aviation, while Russia has imposed bans on four of its airlines after consulting the EU and restricted six others, Bulgaria has revoked the licences of six cargo airlines and Moldova has banned eight airlines.Meanwhile, Pakistan International Airlines, subject of a controversial EU ban earlier this year, had restrictions on some of its aircraft lifted. The airline's fleet of Boeing 777s and some of their Boeing 747s and Airbus 310s will now be allowed back into European airspace.The announcements come after three accidents involving Indonesian airliners - the New Year's Day crash of Adam Air Flight 574, which killed 102 people, the subsequent accident involving Adam Air Flight 172, which cracked in half on a hard landing but held together, preventing serious injury, and the March crash of state-run Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which claimed 23 lives. All the accidents involved ageing Boeing 737 aircraft.The European Union has maintained its ban on all 51 of Indonesia's airlines on the grounds of safety concerns. The Indonesian foreign ministry, which had earlier believed its plan to "fast-track" safety improvements for three airlines would see them back in the EU by July's end, suggested that the ban may have political overtones.Indonesia had implemented a program to bring state-owned flag carrier Garuda Indonesia up to EU standards, as well as private rivals Mandala Airlines and Airfast. This received a boost in May when Garuda passed a safety audit by the International Air Transport Association."Indonesian authorities have still not developed and implemented an efficient oversight program on any of the carriers under their regulatory control," said the EU's Air Safety Committee upon rejection of the three airlines' request for permission to return to the EU. It was added that Indonesia had no effective oversight program and that the International Civil Aviation Organisation had been unable to assess recent changes. The committee also noted that inspectors did not have the power to ground substandard aircraft and urged Indonesia to increase inspections themselves. A report from the Indonesian director-general of civil aviation said that, between January and April, Garuda performed just nine of 56 mandatory surveys, while Mandala conducted only two out of 27.The committee acknowledged some improvement by the three airlines, but was unanimous in rejecting their request to have the ban lifted.Teuku Faizasyah, spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry, expressed disappointment at the result and questioned the reasoning behind it. "We are disappointed with the prolonging of the ban. We've done some improvements so we do hope that those actions taken could be considered," he told reporters. "The way we see it, the EU always puts their actions (in terms of) technicality issues. But we question if there are political motivations behind the decision."The ban was implemented in 2007 following deregulation in the 1990s that triggered a string of aviation accidents. On New Year's Day 2007, 102 people were killed when an Adam Air Boeing 737 crashed into the ocean near Sulawesi. This was followed in March by a Garuda 737 overshooting the runway at Yogyakarta Internataional Airport with 21 fatalities.Adam Air has since been grounded, while on Thursday Captain Marwoto Komar, pilot of the Garuda jet, went on trial charged with a range of possible offences, the most serious of which could see him imprisoned for life.Europe has been hit by fierce wind and storms, with gusts over 150 kilometers per hour reported from the UK to Southern Germany. Most major motorways are blocked/shut due to lorries being overturned by the wind.Most European Airports, Train and Motorways have been affected. Amsterdam has been cut off, with planes grounded, and the train system from Amsterdam city halted.A sudden cold snap across Europe caused a surge in demand for electricity. Two high voltage power lines in Germany failed.  This triggered a cascade of cuts as automatic safety devices cut millions of customers in order to prevent a total blackout of the continent. Parts of Germany, Belgium, France (including parts of Paris), Spain, and Italy were affected. High speed railways were also impacted.  Power was restored within two hours. Later reports said that  Austria and Croatia were also affected. An alternative cause has been suggested; that the opening of the Ems powerline crossing to let a ship pass may have triggered the blackout.A senior director with French power company RTE is reported as saying "We weren't very far from a European blackout".After 13 years of isolation, Southeast Europe (including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia and Romania) were reconnected to the main European transmission system in November 2004.  Now, with 400 million users, the European electrical transmission system has become, in terms of consumption, the world's largest electrical energy system.Italy's Prime minister, Romano Prodi, said there was a "contradiction" in having a unified power network but no European Union central authority.Aviation experts are warning that air traffic across western Europe may continue to be affected by an Icelandic volcano, which has been billowing clouds of ash and spreading it throughout the region.Experts say that the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, located in Iceland, continues to have "sporadic eruptions"; dark ash clouds have been moving south and east of the area, causing mass flight cancellations all over Europe, spanning from the UK to Russia over fears that the soot may be catastrophic to planes - such as causing engines to fail in-flight or severely reducing the pilot's visibility.The ash clouds are drifting between six to nine thousand meters above the ground, and are moving eastwards, over northern France and Austria and towards Russia at about 40 kilometers per hour.Already, thousands of passengers have been left stranded around the world, unable to travel to and from various points in Europe. The continent's air-traffic control center predicted 17,000 flights to have been cancelled on Friday alone, and indicated there would be further disruption today. The cancellations are costing airlines about US$200 million daily, the International Air Transport Association reports.A global association of air traffic control companies commented that ash clouds would probably continue to affect flights for some time. "The knock-on effect of the volcanic ash plume over northern Europe is likely to disrupt European airspace for several days," the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization said in a statement. "Traffic will have to be reorganized and rerouted and flights preplanned, all on a dynamic and quite unpredictable basis.""The skies are totally empty over northern Europe," said Eurocontrol's deputy head, Bryan Flynn. The agency said more than half of Europe's average 28,000 daily flights were cancelled yesterday, twice as many as were called off on Thursday.In a special report, Wikinews takes a look at how different countries have been affected by this event.Some of Europe's airlines and airports have called into question whether the mass restrictions imposed on the continent's airspace, due to volcanic ash in the area, are necessary. Millions of travellers have been stranded by the cancellations; however, some airlines have made test flights to see if there were any immediate effects on jets after flying through ash. Authorities fear that the ash can cause vital aircraft parts, such as the engines, to fail in-flight.Three large airlines — KLM, Air France, and Lufthansa — have already made test flights.  Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, the head of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), commented: "Verification flights undertaken by several of our airlines have revealed no irregularities at all; this confirms our requirement that other options should be deployed to determine genuine risk."KLM, meanwhile, said that it will allow three freight planes to make flights to Asia, and had transferred seven passenger planes from Duesseldorf, Germany to Amsterdam, without any travellers."We observed no irregularities either during the flight or during the initial inspection on the ground. We hope to receive permission as soon as possible after that to start up our operation and to transport our passengers to their destinations." said KLM chief executive Peter Hartman.ACI Europe and the AEA also commented about the issue in a statement: "While Europe's airlines and airports consider safety to be an absolute priority, they are questioning the proportionality of the flight restrictions currently imposed." "Airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly. It is what our passengers demand of us."Airport closures and cancellations are estimated to be costing airlines about US$200 million daily, the International Air Transport Association reports.The operations control head for Eurocontrol, Brian Flynn, rebuffed notions that aviation officials were being too cautious, describing the issue as an "unknown phenomenon". "With the over-riding objective of protecting the travelling public, these exceptional measures have to be taken," he remarked. "[...] As soon as we are able to, with confidence, and when I say we, I mean the entire community of aviation experts [and] aviation authorities, are able to declare parts of the air space and airports open that will be done."One year after the Deepwater Horizon disaster which caused the largest oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and caused huge environmental damage in the Gulf of Mexico, experts have warned there are serious questions over the safety of deep water drilling as the United States government approves more exploration without improving safety measures.Scientists have raised major concerns over repeated assurances from the industry and the government, who insist lessons have been learned from the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Charles Perrow, a professor at Yale University, said the oil industry "is ill prepared at the least" to deal with another oil spill. "I have seen no evidence that they have marshaled containment efforts that are sufficient to deal with another major spill," he said. While the government has implemented new regulations, technical systems for stopping oil flowing from a leaking well, and increased oversight from oil officials, Perrow said deep water drilling had become no less dangerous. "I don't think they have found ways to change the corporate culture sufficiently to prevent future accidents," he said. "There are so many opportunities for things to go wrong that major spills are unavoidable." Last year, Doug Inkley, a scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said the culture of an "addiction to oil" was ultimately responsible for the catastrophe. "How long must we wait for lawmakers to act to prevent future disasters? How many more lives, livelihoods and animals must be claimed by our addiction to oil?" Greenpeace also slammed BP, who ran Deepwater Horizon, for how they allowed the disaster to happen. "The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now," the organization said.However, under pressure from industry executives the administration of president Barack Obama has resumed issuing drilling permits. It is understood regulators are still allowing oil companies to obtain drilling permits before reviewing new spill response plans. "I'm not an oddsmaker, but I would say in the next five years we should have at least one major blowout," Perrow said. "Even if everybody tries very hard, there is going to be an accident caused by cost-cutting and pressure on workers. These are moneymaking machines and they make money by pushing things to the limit."BP has insisted it has changed safety procedures. The oil giant came under heavy criticism for how it handled the crisis, and other major oil companies insisted Deepwater Horizon was a result of a culture exclusive to BP. Michael Bromwich, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), the U.S. government agency responsible for regulating offshore drilling, said the view was "as disappointing as it is shortsighted," and the issue of deep water safety was "a broad problem."The warnings came as it emerged BP had attempted to take control of an independent study into the environmental consequences of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Internal emails expose how BP executives attempted to influence the study, which was funded by a US$500m grant from the oil company. The study may be part of the final verdict as to what penalties, fines and criminal charges are brought against the company. Greenpeace, who uncovered the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request, attacked the reportedly unsuccessful attempts to influence the supposedly independent study as "outrageous".Protesters rallied outside BP's annual conference in London this week, where shareholders met for the first time since the disaster off the Gulf coast. Executives faced questions over their competence and large salaries from angry shareholders, many of whom disapproved of the appointment of Carl-Henric Svanberg as chairman and Sir Bill Castell as the head of BP's safety board. Some demonstrators purchased shares in BP in an attempt to get inside the meeting; one woman, a fisherwoman who lives on the Gulf Coast was arrested after pouring a black substance down herself at the entrance to the conference centre and refusing to move. "I have travelled all the way over from the Gulf Coast and I just wanted to talk those responsible for destroying my community," she said as she was led away by police. "My community is dead. We've worked five generations there and now we've got a dead community. I'm angry, I've been angry a long time."Three workers have died after an explosion and fire at a Reliance Industries petrochemical plant in Nagothana, Maharashtra, India.The fire broke out shortly after 11 a.m. in one of the facility's two linear low density poly-ethylene (LLDPE) units. The unit, which has a 60,000 tonne per anum (TPA) capacity, had been shut down 24 hours before the accident for maintenance. Several people were injured as well as the three who were killed.There are four production units at the plant, including another LLDPE unit with a 100,000 TPA capacity. None of these were affected by the fire, which was extuinguished within minutes without material loss, and production and supply of goods will not be affected.An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the accident.An explosion has caused catastrophic damage to a ConAgra Foods plant on Jones Sausage Road in Garner, North Carolina in the United States. At least 300 people were at work in the plant at the time of the incident, 11:27 a.m. EDT (3:27 UTC) on June 9. Estimates indicate that up to 46 people were sent to area hospitals, and, as of 4:00 p.m. EDT, three people are still unaccounted for.The plant was formerly owned by Raleigh, North Carolina based Goodmark Foods, but was purchased by ConAgra Foods seven years ago. The plant makes Slim Jim brand meat snacks, and at 50,000 square feet is one of ConAgra's largest plants.Eyewitnesses reported a loud explosion, and also reported the smell of ammonia. At least one of the building's walls was blown outward, crushing a line of cars, and roof damage was visible in nearly all parts of the main building. Crews are working on containing a leak of anhydrous ammonia; it is unclear if the leak caused the explosion or was caused by the explosion. While area residents also reported smelling ammonia, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials on site have indicated that there is no general health risk to the local residents. Three firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation.Injured employees were sent to several area hospitals, including WakeMed Raleigh Campus, WakeMed Cary, and Rex Hospital. Three patients are being treated at UNC Jaycees Burn Center in Chapel Hill for serious injuries. Uninjured employees were evacuated to the Garner Senior Center and several area churches donated the use of their vans to transport people home from the Senior Center.The explosion caused several road closures in the area, including Interstate 40 Westbound and Jones Sausage Road.File:Fukushima-1.JPGAn explosion has been reported at Japan's stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after its cooling system was damaged by a massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake that hit off the North-East coast of Japan on Friday. The explosion occurred at around 3:00pm local time (6:00am UTC). According to the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, four workers were injured in the explosion.The explosion occurred as workers were attempting to cool a reactor by injecting water into its core. Local media are reporting that the plant's exterior walls have been destroyed and only a skeleton structure remains.More than 45,000 residents within a 10-kilometre radius of the plant have been evacuated.Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant. Local authorities are warning residents in the vicinity of the plant to stay indoors, turn off air-conditioners and not to drink tap water. According to Japan's nuclear agency, radioactive caesium and iodine has been identified at the plant. Authorities speculate that this indicates that containers holding uranium fuel at the site may have ruptured and are leaking.An explosion has taken place in the city centre of Bath, United Kingdom in a new shopping centre which is still being built. The explosion is said to have been caused by a gas canister that caught fire and exploded, setting fire to the building. Firefighters responded and were able to extinguish it at around  18:00 BST, approximately one hour after the explosion took place.Several shops including Marks and Spencer, Boots and Game were evacuated. Bath Spa railway station was also closed off. Avon and Somerset police spokeswoman Jenny Bigwood said "The area has been cordoned off at the request of the fire and rescue service as there are believed to be a number of gas cylinders on the site." The fire service spokesperson also said that "officers were called just after 5pm today to a report of a fire at the SouthGate building site."According to eyewitness reports there was "black smoke, ...a few bangs and a series of fairly large explosions."Bath Spa railway station has since reopened but several people cannot get their cars out of the area due to closed roads. A shelter has been set up at the Pavilion near the leisure centre in North Parade Road. The centre was due to open in 2009 but is due to be delayed. Despite the large size of the explosion, it is believed that no one has suffered from any injuries as a result of the incident.A huge explosion at the third-largest oil refinery in the United States killed at least 14 workers and injured more than 100 others at about 1:30 p.m. local time (19:30 UTC) on Wednesday, in Texas City, Texas.The blast caused extensive damage to the BP facility, left a large crater in the ground, and flung chunks of burnt metal onto cars and trucks in the employee parking lot. Windows and lights shattered in homes and other buildings miles from the blast location. A massive cloud of black smoke hovered over the sky."It was real scary," refinery worker Charles Gregory told the Associated Press. "Have you ever hear the thunder real loud? It was like 10 times that," he said.Authorities do not suspect that the explosion was caused by terrorism, but have not yet determined the cause of the blast. Federal investigators have been sent to the site, according to Daniel Horowitz, the director of public affairs for the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board."We have no reason to believe this was anything caused by an outside agent," said BP spokesman Hugh Depland.The 1,200-acre facility employs 1,800 workers, and outputs three percent of the oil supply for the United States (almost half a million barrels a day). The western side of the facility directly affected by the blast makes high-grade fuel.Firefighters worked for over two hours to fight blazes caused by the explosion.Company officials have not yet announced how long production will be suspended at the refinery. Gasoline futures began trading higher at an all-time peak of $1.60 a gallon during after-hours trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but retreated to $1.58 later in the evening."It's a sad day for BP," said site director Don Parus.Texas City last suffered a major accident in April 1947, when a ship filled with ammonium nitrate exploded, killing about a third of the town's population, and injuring about 5,000 others.An explosion at the University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou) on Monday afternoon left four people injured, authorities say.The explosion occurred in a science laboratory in Schweitzer Hall around 2:20 p.m. CDT (1920 UTC) Monday. The source of the explosion was first thought to have been a 2,000-pound (907.2-kilogramme) hydrogen tank, but fire officials later said that this was not the case. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation by the Columbia Fire Department.The Columbia Fire Department arrived at Schweitzer Hall after a report of a structure fire, but found that most of the fire had already been extinguished by the building's fire sprinkler system. The remaining flames were put out by firefighters, one of whom said it looked as if "a bomb went off in the lab".Of the four hurt in the blast, one was a research scientist, one a graduate student, and the other two postdoctoral fellows. Three were treated for mild injuries and released from University Hospital, while the fourth was in good condition after being taken to the hospital's burn unit for life-threatening injuries. A school spokesperson said that the university was not allowed to release the names of the victims.Authorities initially believed that a large container of hydrogen gas had exploded, but investigators later said that the tank was intact. Fire officials also retracted an earlier statement that said the incident had been a result of human error. In a Monday night news release, the fire department said that lab workers had turned on the hydrogen but did not recognize warning signs indicating a dangerously high level of hydrogen gas in the lab, so they left the gas supply running. The report said the explosion occurred after the gas reached a source of ignition. However, the department said Tuesday that the investigation into the explosion is still ongoing and that they were not certain human error was the cause.The investigation should determine the cost of repairs for the building, as well as whether the school should implement new procedures to avoid similar incidents in the future. The lab where the explosion took place will be totally rebuilt.Schweitzer Hall houses Mizzou's biochemistry department, which is part of the medical and agricultural programs. The building's single classroom is located in the basement and was not in use at the time. The explosion happened on a third-story lab assigned to Judy Wall, a university professor, who was in her office across from the lab during the incident and referred inquiries to the news bureau. Other labs in the building were not disturbed, and Schweitzer Hall was established to be structurally sound, although nearly twenty windows had been shattered from the blast. The building reopened Tuesday for researchers to continue working.An explosion at a weapons factory in Yemen killed dozens of people yesterday. According to estimates, over one hundred people may have died in the blast.According to the BBC, at least 78 people were killed, while The Independent reported that over one hundred people had been killed. The explosion occurred in the southern town of Ja`ar, located in the province of Abyan.Local media reported that forces loyal to Al-Qaeda had raided the factory on Sunday. They added that residents were forced to gather supplies from the factory, when a cigarette reportedly triggered the explosion.State news agency Saba said that militants had "seized the factory on Sunday and pushed citizens to [loot] its contents, which led to inflaming of gunpowder and explosives in the factory."A local doctor said that "[t]his accident is a true catastrophe, the first of its kind in Abyan. There are so many burned bodies. I can't even describe the situation." An accurate death toll is reportedly difficult to ascertain due to the condition of bodies, many of which have severe burns.A blast is reported to have occurred inside the car park of the Perambra Police station in Kozhikode (Calicut) in the state of Kerala, India. One police officer and a seven-year-old boy have reported to be injured in the incident.The Home minister for state of Kerala Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has ordered a probe to identify the cause of the incident. The police say the explosion originating from bombs that were seized by the police in 2002, which now might have been triggered by the heat. Locals reject this explanation and suspect a cover-up. An explosion last week killed eight in Kozhikode.A small explosion blew out the windows of a local cigarette store in Pleasant Hill, California this morning. A police officer was driving by the area at approximately 5:00 a.m., when the explosion occurred. Due to the early morning hour, no one was injured in the blast.  Firefighters responded quickly and the fire was brought under control shortly.  There appears to be fairly little damage to the neighboring store fronts.This is the fourth time in the last year that the store has had arson related troubles.  The owner, Joe Banga, has decided to sell off the store because of this latest attack."I'm done," said Banga, who has owned the store for almost five years. "I'm going to sell it.""The damage is pretty bad," he added. "I have no choice. It's a loss, loss, loss."Police do not know why the store has been repeatedly targeted. According to the owner, there have three other attempts to burn down the store since August 2008."Obviously with these attempts, somebody's trying to get this business burned down. But we haven't found specific reasons," said police lieutenant Jose Delatorre.An explosion in an electricity substation in Chelmsford, Essex has killed one person. Buildings have been evacuated and residents have been advised to stay inside to avoid fumes. The blast occurred at approximately 12:15 p.m. local time, near Anglia Ruskin University.The local hospital, Chelmsford General Hospital, was forced to switch over to emergency power after supplies were cut. A representative from Essex Fire and Rescue told BBC News, "This is a large fire in an electrical sub-station which operates at 132 kilo-volts and supplies power to North Chelmsford.""There is nothing to suggest that there is more than one fatality or any other people injured following this fire. The identity of the deceased is yet to be confirmed," stated a representative from Essex Police.According to Chinese state media, at least 30 people were killed and a further 57 were injured, 4 in critical state, after a gas leak resulted in an explosion in a coal mine in the countryThe incident occurred on Saturday in a mine in Chongqing, lcoated in central China.The Xinhua news agency reports that rescuers have managed to recover 30 bodies, but have not managed to reach twenty other trapped miners due to dangerously high levels of gas in the mine.An investigation is currently ongoing as to what caused the explosion.China has among the most dangerous coal mines in the world. Over three thousand workers died in China's mines last year, official statistics say.A large explosion ripped through a research building of the École Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Mulhouse (ENSCMu) in Mulhouse, eastern France. Mulhouse's mayor, Jean-Marie Bockel, confirmed that the blast killed one person and injured another. Police declared Code Red, and the neighborhood was evacuated.According to the French Press, TF1, the victim was in his forties and had worked at the institition for about a year. A young woman was seriously injured and about a dozen people received minor injuries, with two suffering from shock. 150 firefighters were on the scene.  The ENSCMu is a technology college, with an enrollment of 8,000 and a 25-hectare campus near the town's centre. It is known for its museum of coloring agents (Musée des Colorants), which has about 2700 samples, mainly from the second part of the nineteenth century. The museum's database is available online in French.The blast occurred at 11:25 GMT (12:25 local time).  It is reported to have been heard two kilometres away and to have broken the windows of nearby buildings. The blast was followed by a fire that was contained by about 15:00 (local time).The explosion's cause is not yet clear but it is believed to have happened in a ground-floor laboratory in an annex building constructed in 1977. The lab was apparently focused on industrial safety.A bomb blast at a mosque in northwestern Pakistan is suspected to have killed at least forty people on Friday.According to police reports, the explosion happened in a village located in the Upper Dir district of the North-West Frontier Province. The incident occurred while worshipers were offering the Friday prayers. "Around 40 people are killed. We have no idea as yet how many have been wounded," said Atif-ur-Rehman, a senior government administrator of Upper Dir.The mosque was damaged heavily by the explosion, and many people have been trapped under debris."A large number of body parts are scattered in the mosque. We don't know whether these are parts of the dead who have been identified or of others," said Umer Rehman, one of the village's residents, to the Reuters news agency.This is the ninth bomb blast in Pakistan since the country's armed forces started attacks against the [[|Pakistani Talian|Taliban]] in the nearby Swat valley from the past few months, in an attempt to force the fighters out of the area.President Zardari and Prime Minister Gillani both condemned the attack. The London-based Muttahida Qaumi Movement chief, Altaf Hussain, has also condemned the blast.The Itar-Tass news agency reports that an explosion in the southern Russian town of Makhachkala, Dagestan, has killed 10 soldiers and wounded 20 others on Friday. Two bombs were set off in a bath house at 2:15 pm local time as the soldiers were passing outside, according to an official of the Russian Interior Ministry. Dagestan borders Chechnya, which has a long history  of uprisings against Russian rule. The current insurrection started at the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990.Sources:  Bomb targets troops, killing 10 in Russia11 Killed, 27 Injured in Makhachkala Friday BlastAn explosion yesterday in a Russian nightclub killed at least 94 people and injured a further 139, according to police reports. The incident happened in the "Lame Horse" bar in the city of Perm near the Ural mountains.According to the regional security minister, Igor Orlov, the club's plastic ceiling caught fire, ignited by firecrackers. Security officials, however, commented that the blast could not have been terrorism. "We are not talking about a terrorist attack, we are talking about a failure to observe fire regulations," said an official for an investigative body, as quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency.A reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency remarked: "Officials have been cited as saying that the incident may have been caused by pyrotechnics that caused an explosion leading to a significant loss of life.""The majority of the deaths were the result of burns or gas inhalation. Along with this, there was a crush at the exit," said a spokesman for a Russian investigative body, Vladimir Markin, as quoted by RIA Novosti. According to RIA, the emergencies ministry stated that "the blast went off at 23:15 Moscow time [20:15 UTC]."An explosion from an underground utility chamber in downtown San Francisco severely injured a woman and shattered a window at a Ralph Lauren clothing store shortly after 10:00 a.m. Pacific time Friday.    According to a caller to KCBS radio, a woman was engulfed in flames after the explosion triggered a fire in the store.  The fire was quickly put out.A bomb squad is currently investigating the explosion, and the cause has yet to be determined.  One official said the explosion may have been caused by an electrical transformer. A witness described a fireball coming out of the side of the buildingPacific Gas & Electric Co. company spokesman Paul Moreno has stated that "there was no indication of a gas leak." Moreno also described the aftermath of the blast. "The explosion did displace manhole covers — two round steel ones — and it also displaced a concrete cover as well," Moreno said.Some accounts have described a rift in the sidewalk caused by the explosion below.Construction worker Tom Demartini, who was sitting in his truck outside the Ralph Lauren store, stated he saw the sidewalk rise up six or seven inches. "It sounded like a big poof, then there was a lot of smoke," Demartini said. "One woman looked like she was badly burned." The burned woman was taken to the emergency room at St. Francis Hospital.  Hospital spokeswoman Linda Gillespie had no immediate comment on her condition. Her name was not released. Workers in a nearby office building described how the blast shook their buildings and that they thought it was an earthquake. According to one woman, the elevator in her building stopped. Scores of police have evacuated buildings several blocks around the explosion.  Kearny street between Sutter and Market has been closed to both vehicles and pedestrians.Reuters, AFP, the Associated Press are reporting that a gas explosion in a Turkish school killed at least seventeen girls Friday.Reuters reports the initial death toll at sixteen, with 27 injured. The number of deaths later rose to 17 when a body was removed from the rubble. Two survivors were pulled from the rubble as rescuers worked into the night. One girl is still missing."We won't stop until we find her," village mayor  Mehmet Demirgul, told the Associated Press.About fifty students and teachers were in the school, where some had gathered on for Islamic study in the three-story structure in the village of Balcilar, near Taskent in the Konya province .Merve Avci, a 13-year-old, slightly injured student spoke to the Anatolian news agency: "I was in the part of the building which didn't collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion, and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors." Anatolian says that Avci was in the process of washing before pre-dawn prayers, when a noise in the building's kitchen led Avci and some teacher to investigate. She says she saw a loose gas pipe before being ordered back to her room. She says she smelled gas coming from somewhere above her room before the explosion."We think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building, given the burns on the injured," Konya province health service official Galip Sef told Reuters.Mayor Demirgul said a leak in a pipe carrying liquefied petroleum gas is the probable cause of the pre-dawn blast."We are hearing voices. I believe those inside the rubble will be saved," Demirgul told reporters, according to the Associated Press and Reuters.The Associated Press reports that a small portion of all three stories of the building were left standing. This is confirmed by images displayed on the Reuters website.The building is owned by a religion foundation and is under investigation when Turkish authorities found an non-approved annex to the structure, according to AFP.The explosion is unrelated to the bomb blast in northern Turkey on July 28.At least fourteen people were injured today by an explosion at the remote Electric Mountain Lodge, in Paonia, Colorado.The blast was reported at 2:30pm local time (9:30 UTC).A county investigator suspects that the explosion was caused by propane gas."We're starting to get patients now, but I can't tell you how many we're expecting – a bunch," hospital administrator Tom Mingen told Denver's CBS4 news from Delta County Memorial Hospital. He continued, "Electric Mountain Lodge is probably in the most remote part of our county. About 20 miles north of Paonia and 17 miles in by snowmobile."The lodge, located in the Gunnison National Forest area at an elevation of 9,200 feet, is only accessible by helicopter or snowmobile during the winter season.Forty-two miners are confirmed dead and 27 are missing, after an explosion at the Xishui Mine in Shuozhou, a city in China's Shanxi province.Six rescue teams are working at the site to rescue the missing personnel, according to Liu Jiwen, an onsite rescue consultant. Two miners were rescued earlier in the day.Xishui Mine is licensed to produce 150,000 tons of coal per year. But the mine was ordered closed in 2004 for safety violations."In defiance of the order, however, mine owners have restarted production this year," stated a province-level official.Police have arrested the owners of the Xishui mine.Zhang Baoshun, the governor of Shanxi province, is on the scene to oversee the rescue work and an investigation of the accident.Twenty-two other miners were working at the nearby Kangjiayao mine at the time of the accident, although it is unclear if any of those miners were affected.Thousands of miners die in mining accidents each year in China. Today's accident comes just one day after 19 coal miners were killed in a mining accident in the Sulongsi mine in Chongqing, and one month after the largest accident in recent history killed 214 miners, in Fuxin, Liaoning Province.An explosion partially destroyed an intelligence building in the city of Rafah, Egypt late tonight (Saturday). The explosion occurred just before midnight local time in Rafah. Witnesses report a large plume of smoke rising from the location.It is not yet known what caused the explosion, but initial reports suggested it was a bomb. Authorities are searching the area for the possibility of more explosives. There are no reports of injuries or deaths.Rafah sits on the border with the Gaza Strip in Palestine.The Indian Navy has said that two explosions yesterday on INS Sindhurakshak, a Russian-built Kilo-class submarine, have trapped up to eighteen of its sailors. Navy officials have warned the families of trapped sailors to "prepare for the worst".The stricken vessel sank in its berth in Mumbai with only a small portion still visible on the surface. The cause of the explosion is still unclear.A fire that started as a result of the explosions has been brought under control and other sailors that managed to escaped received attention from emergency personnel. Divers are attempting to locate survivors and refloat the vessel. In 2010, a fire broke out after an explosion in the battery compartment on the INS Sindhurakshak, killing a sailor. The submarine had recently returned from Russia after undergoing an overhaul and upgrades after the 2010 incident.  The Indian Navy has ten diesel-electric Kilo-class submarines in its fleet. These developments come just days after the Indian Navy launched the nation's first Indian-built aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, which the navy calls their "crowning glory".Five civilian contractors have been injured after an explosion and fire onboard the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Leyte Gulf at 9:25 a.m. today.A large explosion erupted from the ship's berthing area where welding work was being conducted during a stop in Norfolk, Virginia. A fire broke out two decks below main deck, but was quickly extinguished. The injured were taken to Norfolk General Hospital for treatment to injuries not believed to be life-threatening, according to John Kowalczyk, a spokesman for BAE Systems Ship Repair, who were conducting the work.He added that the fire appeared to be an isolated incident. The ship has been laid up for repairs and modernizing since May.According to communications between fire crews, a fan in a hopper exploded on the 4th floor just before midnight (EST). Fire crews responded within minutes, but the fire had been extinguished prior to their arrival. Fire crews say that a "faulty motor in a hopper" exploded, igniting dust around the equipment which caused a fire.The explosion forced the company to shut down all of their mills and power to most of their facility for a short time as a precaution. Production and normal operations began to resume around 12:15 a.m..No one was injured. Fire officials estimate the damage to be around US$100,000.A pipe has burst in New York City, the largest city in the United States, causing a generator to explode. The explosion occurred in Midtown Manhattan near Grand Central Terminal (GCT) and the Chrysler Building, and approximately at the intersection of 41st Street and Lexington Avenue. Nearby buildings have been evacuated, and a large area has been blocked off. There are reports of a very large crater at the scene.The New York Police Department (NYPD) has officially ruled out terrorism. Grand Central Station was quickly evacuated soon after the incident. Subway lines 4, 5 and 6 have no service in both directions between the 125th Street Station and the Bowling Green Station. 42nd Street Shuttle service has been shut completely.   The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) received a call at 5:56 p.m. EDT (UTC-4) reporting an explosion. More than 170 firefighters were dispatched to the scene. Witnesses reported that buildings in the nearby area shook. This was a five-alarm response.At least 20 people have been reported injured, and one woman, Lois Baumerich, died from a heart attack. Two people are currently in critical condition. There are potentially harmful materials at the scene of the explosion and HAZMAT crews are on the scene to clean up debris. There are reports that pipes were wrapped in asbestos, but the air is being tested, and results should be available late Wednesday night.ConEdison Workers are on the scene as well, and it appears that they are working nearby.Emergency workers are reporting that the situation is not under control. They are still unable to confirm why the pipe exploded due to the inaccessible nature of the scene at the source of the explosion. The pressure of steam has subsided and the air appears to have cleared, revealing the crater. Disruption of electricity in the surrounding area is minimal.GCT is reported to be reopened at this time. An area was cordoned off and people trapped in the vicinity due to fears of asbestos pollution resulting from the explosion.According to a press conference with the mayor, the pipe involved was built in 1924, and a likely cause of the eruption and explosion was cold water leaking into the pipe, possibly from rain or from a water pipe.  A tow truck had fallen into the crater left by the explosion, and the explosion also shattered glass on nearby buildings.Two explosions have been reported in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, killing some 40 people. It was reported the two blasts rocked a park and a popular eat-out in Hyderabad on Saturday evening within a gap of 15 minutes.The injured, a total of 350, have been taken to nearby hospitals. Both the areas have been evacuated. The first explosion took place at Lumbini Park near the state secretariat at around 20:00 and another at Gokul Chat Bhandar 15 minutes later, they said. A laser show was going on at Lumbini Park when the blast occurred.At least 30 explosions have gone off inside the "Green Zone" in Baghdad, Iraq where the United States Embassy is located and where many Iraqi Government buildings are housed. Iraqi military officials said no evacuations of residents were ordered from the Dora area.The explosions are believed to be the result of a fire which broke out inside the Forward Operating Base Falcon, a U.S. ammunitions depot inside the zone, but it is not known if the fire was started due to an attack."An ammunition holding area caught on fire. It's in our operating base in the Rasheed area of the city. The ammunition holding area contains tank and artillery rounds as well as small arms ammunition," said Lieutenant Colonel of the 4th Infantry Division, Jonathan Withington."The cause of the fire is not immediately known. The explosions are from ammunition 'cooking off.' [We are] trying to determine the cause or any threat to the population," said U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col, Christopher C. Garver.Reports say that flares and helicopters could be seen coming from and into the zone.So far, there are no reports of any deaths or injuries.The explosions began around 4:00 p.m. EDT.Three explosions rocked the Egyptian resort city of Dahab and killed at least 24 people. Between 60 and 150 people were injured in the attack.The blasts came at the height of the tourist season, officials said. The three time bombs exploded in a busy restaurant and in a market area in the Red Sea resort city within a span of five minutes.Dahab is located on the Gulf of Aqaba on the eastern side of the Sinai Peninsula.Pula, Croatia - Blasts destroyed two vans owned by ethnic Albanian shop owners at two different locations in Pula, a city in the Croatian region of Istria. There were no injuries in the explosions and there was no responsibility attributed. Relatives of the shop owners attributed the explosions to the present situation regarding the declaration of independence of Kosovo. There are some 2,000 ethnic Albanians in Istria.At some time before 11 AM, local time, a fire started in Bar Apache on the popular Phi Phi Island in Thailand.By eleven it had spread to neighbouring shops and restaurants along the main road. Since there is no fire brigade on Phi Phi, locals and tourists formed a bucket chain to help put out the fire. An eye witness, Simon Vestling, says there were over 300 people helping out with putting out the fire and tearing down buildings.To stop the fire from spreading to other nearby buildings, which are  closely grouped together, they were forced to pull some of them down using nothing but man power. This managed to stop the fire from spreading to the rest of the island, but 10 buildings were still burnt down, mostly small shops and bars.Boats were brought over from local Krabi Island in case an evacuation was needed, but that was not the case. The cost of the damage is estimated to be Bt2million.Two Swedes sustained minor injuries from the smoke, but were treated with oxygen at a nearby dive center. No other injuries have been reported at this time.In the United States this morning, an F-15 Eagle fighter jet from the Missouri Air National Guard crashed near Vincennes, Indiana. Reports say that the pilot successfully ejected prior to the crash and walked to first responders under his own power. The crash occurred in a sparsely populated area and there are no reports of injuries on the ground.The pilot was taken to Vincennes Hospital to be checked for injuries.The fighter jet was performing maneuvers with three other aircraft, none of which were involved in the incident. All four aircraft are part of the 131st Fighter Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard, flying out of Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri.  The training maneuvers were taking place at Military Operating Area Red Hills in southern Illinois and Indiana.Resources from the Indiana Air National Guard 181st Fighter Wing from Terre Haute, Indiana, are securing the area surrounding the crash site. They will be joined by UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter support from the 38th Aviation Brigade of the Indiana National Guard from Shelbyville, Indiana.The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered a review Friday into the design and manufacture of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, following five incidents in five days involving the aircraft and two Japanese airlines.On Monday, an electrical fire broke out aboard a Japan Airlines 787 at Boston's Logan International Airport, when a battery pack which powers the auxiliary power unit, for when the plane is on the ground, caught fire. The fire was discovered by maintenance workers after passengers and crew disembarked following their flight from Tokyo's Narita Airport.The next day, a separate Japan Airlines 787, also at Logan International Airport, heading to Tokyo, suffered a fuel leak that spilled around 40 gallons, which was spotted by the crew of the aircraft taxiing behind them. "That Japan Air may know it, but they’ve got fuel or something spilling out the outboard left wing. Quite a bit," said the pilot of aircraft behind them on local air traffic control frequencies.Wednesday, in Japan, an All Nippon Airways 787, the launch customer for the aircraft, cancelled a flight after a brake problem was reported.Earlier Friday, two All Nippon Airways suffered separate incidents in Japan.  An oil leak was noticed in the engine after one aircraft had landed in Miyazaki, coming from Tokyo's Haneda Airport. Another flight, flying between Haneda Airport and Matsuyama said the pilot's side window in the cockpit suffered a crack.The FAA in a statement said "In light of a series of recent events, the FAA will conduct a comprehensive review of the Boeing 787 critical systems, including the design, manufacture and assembly." Further adding, "The purpose of the review is to validate the work conducted during the certification process and further ensure that the aircraft meets the FAA’s high level of safety."According to the statement, "The review will also examine how the electrical and mechanical systems interact with each other." The Boeing 787 relies more on electrical, as opposed to mechanical, systems than past aircraft from the manufacturer including having electronics operate hydraulic pumps and using electric brakes. Large portions of the plane's structure use lightweight carbon fiber composite instead of more traditional metal airframe.U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said, "The safety of the traveling public is our top priority [...] This review will help us look at the root causes and do everything we can to safeguard against similar events in the future.""We are confident that the aircraft is safe.  But we need to have a complete understanding of what is happening," said newly sworn-in FAA Administrator Michael P. Huerta. "We are conducting the review to further ensure that the aircraft meets our high safety standards."Boeing released a statement saying, "[The company] is confident in the design and performance of the 787. It is a safe  and efficient airplane. The airplane has logged 50,000 hours of flight and there are more than 150 flights occurring daily."On the popular social networking website Facebook, various groups commemorating disgruntled pilot Joseph Andrew Stack were formed on Thursday evening. Earlier that day, in what has been described as an act of "domestic terrorism," Stack intentionally crashed his small passenger plane into an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) office building in Austin, Texas. Stack is one of two reported fatalities; the other is an IRS employee.On the information page of the first group named "The Joe 'Take My Pound Of Flesh' Stack Anti-IRS Fan Page," one administrator wrote, "[This page is] dedicated to a man, frustrated as so many of us are with our corrupt, inept government, sacrificed his life to make a statement. Will history see him as a patriot or terrorist? Depends on who is doing the writing." This particular group had approximately 250 members.Another group called "The Philosophy of Joe Stack" apparently came out against the attack, yet sympathized with its reasons: "This page is NOT to glorify his actions, but simply to say that after reading his note, we can agree with...Joe Stacks' thoughts." However, one member went as far to suggest that the United States "need[ed] a revolution" and "voting for a Democrat or a Republican is not revolutionary, it is big business as usual."A third group titled "Joseph Andrew Stack, we salute thee" was supposedly against violence towards others. One administrator did write, "We hope that everyone is okay and accounted for. It is our belief that his intention was not to hurt anyone, but just to prove a point."On the wall of a fourth group, known simply as "Joseph Andrew Stack," creator Emily Walters of Louisville, Kentucky, wrote: "Finally an American man took a stand against our tyrannical government that no longer follows the constitution and is[sic] turned its back on its founding fathers and the beliefs this country was founded on." "That so many have already contributed to Facebook page[s] as 'fans' of this terrorist attack on public servants is a truly appalling expression of extremism, which Americans will overwhelmingly reject," Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas told The Politico regarding the creation and subsequent growth of said pages.Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities says that its users are prohibited from "post[ing] content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence." Facebook has decided that it would be appropriate under said policy to delete these four groups.At approximately 8:10 AM CST December 6, 2006 a factory owned by the FALK Corporation exploded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The blast could apparently be felt up to thirty miles away. A plume of smoke was seen rising from the explosion site, and the area around the factory was reported to smell of burning wood.The explosion apparently occurred when a container of 72,000 gallons of propane exploded, destroying the building. Three people are confirmed dead and forty-six injured, with one person suffering life-threatening injuries, according to a press conference with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee Police Chief Nan Hagerty at 5:00 PM CST broadcast on WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee.  Local news reports state that the three dead were aged 37, 49, and 38.With a population of 596,000 (according to the 2000 Census), Milwaukee is the 19th largest city in the United States.The factory had made industrial gears since the 1800s.File:Busca voo Air France 447 1.jpgTeams from France and Brazil have confirmed that neither have recovered any debris from Air France Flight 447. The Airbus A330 with 228 on board vanished from radar on June 1st over the Atlantic Ocean.The Brazilian Air Force had previously released a statement on June 2 saying debris from the lost jet had been found. A wooden cargo pallet and two buoys had been recovered, but are now believed to have been from a ship. The flight was carrying no wooden pallets. On June 2, it was reported, and previously confirmed by the Brazilian Air Force, that one seat and a life vest were found floating in the water. A fuel slick also thought to be from the plane, has also been confirmed to have come from another source, most likely a ship. The presence of fuel was used as evidence to suggest there had been no fire or explosion on board. Spanish paper El Mundo has quoted an Air Comet pilot flying over the Atlantic at the time as saying he witnessed "an intense burst of white light" falling out of the sky and breaking apart. A bomb threat, which later turned out to be "false", was also reported on a separate Air France flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Paris on May 27, just days before Fight 447 went missing.  The French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) is leading the investigation, and has so far established that there were thunderstorms in the area and a series of automated signals from the plane indicated an inconsistent speed and a string of systems failures.At 11:10 p.m. the autopilot disengaged and at least one computer switched to an alternative power source. There was an indication that flight control systems had sustained damage, and this was followed by the failure of speed, heading and altitude indicators as well as flight control systems, while control systems for the central computer system and wing spoilers also failed. Four minutes after the problems began the last message indicated total electrical failure and a loss of cabin pressure.French armed forces spokesman Christophe Prazuck commented that "Everyone has doubts about everything at the moment and we do not have the slightest beginnings of an answer yet." French paper Le Monde commented that the aircraft's speed was too low, prompting the BEA to warn against "hasty interpretation or speculation" in regards to the cause. Airbus have reminded all A330 operators of correct operating procedures in extreme weather conditions.France has sent the research ship Pourquoi Pas? to the scene and the vessel is currently en route with mini-submarines to assist in searching for and recovering debris. The search is still underway for the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes. Brazilian officials previously said the boxes could be at the bottom of the ocean, between "2,000 or 3,000 metres [6,500 to 9,800 feet] in that area of the ocean."A family visiting Christchurch, New Zealand from Australia was minutes away from being burnt to death.They were staying in the Meadow Park Holiday Park, Papanui.The fire started about 3 a.m. NZST and Station officer Paul Rodwell said, "From the description, they were a few minutes away from perishing."New Zealand-born Elaine Puku is on life support in Christchurch Hospital's intensive-care unit after receiving internal and external second-degree burns while trying to rescue her children. Other family members - Malcolm Puku, 47, and sons Jeremy, 17, Matthew, 13, and Jordan, 10 - were also in the fire, but escaped grievous injury. They are currently recovering from minor cuts and smoke inhalation."I opened up the door into the lounge and the room was like a big volcano, so red and bright and yellow, and all this billowing black smoke," Malcolm Puku said.There were no smoke alarms in the unit."It doesn't have any fire-protection smoke alarms because it's an old place," Rodwell said.Fire safety officer Graham Davies said that the accommodation is exempt since it was built before fire detectors became compulsory.The motel is now under investigation by the Fire Service.Five people were killed early Thursday morning in a three-alarm fire in the New York City borough of Staten Island. The fire destroyed most of the home in the Port Richmond neighborhood. The five killed are 33-year-old Leisha Jones and her four children.Neighbors said that the fire began at approximately 4 a.m. local time (0800 UTC). Two New York Police Department officers noticed the fire and radioed for assistance at 4:10 a.m. Rescue workers attempted to enter the building although they were deterred by heavy flames and smoke. Once flames were doused with water, Fire Lieutenant Robert Strafer entered the building and found the youngest child, two-year-old Jermaine Sinclair. Upon further inspection, officers found the other four victims.Witnesses reported hearing a loud popping sound before the building burst into flames. The cause of the fire is currently unknown, although it is not considered suspicious. The apartment which Jones and her children were living in did not have a smoke detector, as required by city law.Jones's mother, Martha Anderson, told the New York Daily News, "She was such a nice person and she was a really good mother," adding, "She loved her kids ... and I loved her."Following a new report into the loss of a Nimrod jet belonging to the UK's Royal Air Force over Afghanistan the family of one of the victims is seeking a criminal prosecution. Sergeant Ben Knight, aged 25, was among the fourteen killed when Nimrod XV230 crashed in 2006.Knight's parents have applied via their lawyers Smithfield Partners to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider evidence contained in a report by Charles Haddon-Cave QC, who is due to appear before the House of Commons next month. The Loss Of RAF Nimrod XV230, A Failure Of Leadership, Culture And Priorities stated that the accident was preventable and that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) made spending cuts a priority over safety. A 2005 review into Nimrod safety was "riddled with errors," the report found.Smithfield Partners have also written to the Health and Safety Executive, asking for the MoD to be investigated for breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The letter was addressed directly to deputy chief executive Kevin Myres.XV230 had shortly completed air-to-air refueling on September 2, 2006, when it was destroyed by an explosion. "We had a 25-year-old healthy son, who used to play squash and, to put it bluntly, he ended up as a plastic bag full of bits," said Graham Knight. "That is something which is very hard to cope with."The Knights met Armed Forces Minister Bill Rammell in London yesterday. Rammell said he was unable to comment on possible legal action against individuals, but promised to provide answers to other questions posed by the Knights and other families. The Crown Prosecution Service has promised consider the matter, and the Health and Safety Executive said it could not comment this early on in developments. The latest report names five people in the MoD, three with BAE Systems and two with defence company QinetiQ, as responsible.Fargo, North Dakota is preparing itself for what could be its worst flood ever. Hundreds of high school and college students worked with two hundred National Guard soldiers Monday on the task of filling over a million sandbags in the effort to stave off the rising Red River. Classes at North Dakota State University were canceled in order to lend the assistance of its students and faculty. The threat of further rainfall has increased the flood risk, with the river now predicted to crest as high as 52 feet (15.8 meters), over twice that of its lowest flood stage. An emergency levee south of town is also being hastily constructed. Three machines capable of filling 15,000 sandbags an hour are being used around the clock to keep up with demand. Temporary dikes from Louisiana are being flown in. The dikes, 4 foot high interlocking containers filled with sand, were used during Hurricane Katrina. In Emmons County, several dozen homes were evacuated on Sunday, and families in the town of Beulah, North Dakota have also been forced to leave ahead of the rising waters. The current scenario is a reminder of the record 1997 flood which inundated the Red River Valley. Fargo constructed a levee system following the disaster to help prevent future flooding. Up to 6000 homes are currently at risk, with many communities farther downriver also preparing for flooding. The American Red Cross has sent over 20,000 prepackaged meals, along with cots and blankets.  Its volunteers around the country have been put on standby, ready to travel to North Dakota if necessary.  All eyes are currently on the skies, as the fate of many communities will be determined largely by how much rain and snow falls over the next week.A mine accident killed at least nine miners in a coal mine in western Turkey.  A methane explosion collapsed a mine shaft about 150 meters below the town of Odakoy, in Balıkesir Province, near the border with Bursa Province.  Rescue work was slowed by the presence of gas, with rescue workers having to be hospitalized for methane poisoning.Turkey suffers relatively frequent mine accidents, especially due to methane pockets either igniting or poisoning miners.  Some observers fault old & untrustworthy equipment, or a disregard for safety regulations.Charlotte Harrison, from Beverly Hills, fell to her death while taking pictures at the edge of a steep canyon after she stepped over a low rock wall at a pull out on the Grand Loop Road in Yellowstone National Park.Rangers were called to the Calcite Springs area, just north of Tower Falls at about 6:30 p.m. on Friday. They could see a woman lying immobile on the canyon floor near the Yellowstone River.Yellowstone fire department and a technical rescue team responded. A ranger rappelled down the steep 500-foot embankment to reach the woman and confirmed that she was dead. Due to darkness, steep terrain, and the complex nature of this type of large scale operation, park staff had to wait until Saturday morning to remove the victim from the canyon floor.  An autopsy conducted over the weekend shows the cause of death was massive trauma caused by the fall.  32-year old Harrison and a 39-year-old male friend from Los Angeles were traveling through the park, and had stopped to take pictures at a pullout in the Calcite Springs area just north of Tower Falls when the incident occurred.This is the second fatal fall at this particular pullout in two years.  Harrison slipped off the edge only about four meters from where a woman fell to her death in April 2006.The incident remains under investigation.  Anyone with information they think might help investigators is asked to call the Park Tip Line at 307-344-2132.Last week's police helicopter accident in eastern Slovakia was caused by technical failure and not human error, said the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic on Friday.  The statement is based on preliminary flight recorder data analysis. Ministry spokesperson Petar Lazarov confirmed the flight recorder and remains of the helicopter will be sent to the United States for further analysis.  Helicopter crash occurred during a training exercise on May 10 shortly before 2:30 PM CEST at Prešov Air Base near Prešov, resulting in deaths of two crewmembers and serious injuries of both pilots.According to initial reports by the Slovak Police Force, the helicopter spiraled down from a height of about 100 metres and 200 metres away from the point of take-off. Slovak tabloid newspaper Plus Jeden Deň wrote that, according to a source from the forensic team that analysed flight recorders data, both rotors failed at the same time. The accident caused fatal injuries to two Fire and Rescue Corps firefighters, First Lieutenant ((sk))Slovak language: ‍nadporučík Peter Toďor, born 1974, and Lieutenant Colonel ((sk))Slovak language: ‍podplukovník Radoslav Lacko, born 1968.  According to reports, one died on the site, and one in the Louis Pasteur University Hospital in Košice. "The patient suffered serious head and chest injuries. Our doctors resuscitated him for about 50 minutes. Ultimately, he died of his injuries," said hospital spokesperson Ivana Stašková.  Both firefighters were buried on May 16. The helicopter pilots were hospitalized with serious injuries in the Ján Adam Reiman Teaching Hospital with Polyclinic in Prešov. While one of them was stabilized and conscious already on May 10, suffering from right femoral fracture, right rib and facial bone fracture, the second one is still in serious condition at the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Medicine, said hospital spokesperson Renáta Cenková. The Bell 429 GlobalRanger helicopter, registration OM-BYM, was made in 2014 and commissioned by the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Interior on August 17, 2015. The Aviation Department later commissioned another Bell 429 helicopter, registration OM-BYD. According to Bell Helicopter, the primary purpose of both these helicopters was to be "border protection, search and rescue, natural disaster relief missions and road traffic law enforcement". Bell Helicopter reacted on the incident, expressing condolences and willingness to assist with the investigation.  Members of the National Council started their late-afternoon session on May 10 with a minute of silence for the victims of the crash.  Other government officials expressed their condolences as well, including the President Andrej Kiska, the Prime Minister Robert Fico, and the Mayor of Prešov Andrea Turčanová.This accident was not the first Bell 429 helicopter crash in Slovakia. On September 7 of last year, an Air-Transport Europe rescue helicopter crashed near Banská Bystrica, killing all three crewmen and a patient aboard.  Investigation is still in progress and no preliminary results are known.Five people were killed by an 18 year-old man who opened fire inside the Trolley Square Mall on Monday evening, according to preliminary reports. Police say they have shot dead one suspect. The shootings started at 6:45 in The Old Spaghetti Factory on the second floor of the Trolley Square Mall.Two employees of the Williams-Sonoma store, near the southwest corner of Trolley Square, told KSL that they heard shots and breaking glass from the area of the west parking garage. They say they saw a gunman about 6'3”, wearing a dark trench coat, carrying a shotgun, probably in his 20's. He came into the mall from the parking garage. A witness at Trolley Square has said that there may have been a second shooter, a man dressed in normal clothing and carrying a young child. Multiple news outlets have reported an off-duty police officer from the nearby city of Ogden confronted and shot the suspect. This officer is likely the "second shooter" reported earlier.KTVX had reported that there may have been another shooter inside the facility, however this was later found to not be the case.The mall evacuation began at 7:00 and is progressing slowly. The shooter has been identified as Solejman Talovic, an eighteen year-old Bosnian refugee living in Salt Lake City.A fire on a train last night in Bedfordshire, England, may have been started deliberately in a suicide attempt. The  British Transport Police has told Wikinews the incident "is not being treated as an accident". One female passenger, who is believed to have started the fire in a lavatory cubicle, was killed.No-one else was injured in the accident, but it led to the closure of the critical West Coast Main Line after emergency services attended the scene. The train was approaching Leighton Buzzard when smoke was seen coming from the washroom. "A passenger reported the fire to a conductor," a spokesperson for London Midland said. "All the other passengers got off safely."Witnesses said the blaze broke out on a rush hour train travelling to London from Northampton. "The smoke was so thick it got onto your chest," one 68-year-old said. "The fire, police and ambulance service were here very quickly." The fire caused severe rail disruption as the line was closed while electric cables running along the track were turned off to protect emergency workers at the site of the incident. Passengers have criticised London Midland for how they handled the incident. "People would have been more understanding if we knew how bad the fire was [and] that the power was off," one passenger, giving his name as Wai, wrote on the the social networking site Twitter. Another, Ross Lankshear, wrote: "It's very frustrating when you are waiting 1 hour then told trains are running but the staff are in the wrong place."London Midland told Wikinews they were attempting to restore rail services on the West Coast Main Line. "We apologise to those passengers disrupted by this tragic incident," they said. "London Midland tickets were accepted by other operators and buses used as rail replacement services." They said service on the line was resumed at 7.30pm.A collision between two United States military helicopters in Iraq that killed four last month has been blamed on enemy fire. The two OH-58 Kiowa Warriors had been on a mission in Kirkuk when they were targeted and struck each other during evasive action, killing all those on board.The anouncement on the involvement of hostile fire, which had previously been ruled out, was made at Fort Drum shortly after a memorial service for the two crews, who had been based there. The Army said that forensic evidence revealed the presence of enemy fire."The two OH-58D helicopters were engaged and struck by hostile fire while conducting a reconnaissance mission," said a Fort Drum spokeswoman. The Agence France-Presse was told that the investigation "determined that the two OH-58 helicopters involved in the January 25 incident [sic] in Kirkuk province were engaged and struck by hostile fire," and that "While executing evasive manoeuvres in response to the hostile fire, the two OH-58s collided, resulting in the catastrophic loss of both aircraft and crews," by a US Army spokesman for northern Iraq. There is no indication as in to the precise nature of the attack.Sunni nationalist extremist group Nakshabandiya had handed out leaflets after the attack saying they had shot the aircraft down and "would soon show a video," later repeating this claim on their website. The group has ties to Saddam Hussein's fugitive deputy Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri.The death toll was the highest for US soldiers in a single event for four months in Iraq. The four men were Philip E. Windorski Jr., Matthew Kelley, Joshua Tillery and Benjamin Todd, all Warrant Officers with the 10th Mountain Division's 10th Combat Aviation Brigade. All are survived by their wives and children.A tornado tore through much of the town of Van, Texas late Sunday evening. Officials said over 40 people were transported to local hospitals for treatment and reportedly two people died during the storm — David Tapley, a retired Garland, Texas police officer, and his wife.The National Weather Service estimated winds over 130 miles per hour (210 kilometres per hour) during the tornado. Late Monday afternoon, debris was still scattered over much of the central portion of the town. An historic building which served as the town's first school suffered significant damage. Other school buildings were also damaged. All classes for students were cancelled for Monday.Work crews and numerous utility trucks were on site Monday and the city's main street remained closed to thru traffic. A residential area on the town's eastern side was littered with debris and downed trees could be seen along the streets. Fifteen fire departments across five Texas counties responded following the storm, according to the county fire marshal.A 35-year-old man had been charged with murdering his daughter after allegedly throwing her from the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne, Australia.The man, named as IT consultant Arthur Phillip Freeman, was arrested following an incident at 0910AEST (2210 UTC) where Darcey Iris Freeman, 4, fell 60m into a river. She was rescued from the water but had suffered severe injuries and died later in the city's Royal Children's Hospital.Two other children were in the car at the time of the incident. They are believed also to be the children of Arthur Freeman. Freeman and his wife, Peta, split in 2007.Shortly after the incident, Freeman was spotted in the Commonwealth Law Courts in William Street with the two other children. He appeared to be in a distressed or confused state. He was arrested immediately and his case brought to Melbourne Magistrates' Court this afternoon.The police say that Freeman is in an acute psychiatric state and cannot be questioned.Heavy rains in Indonesia yesterday triggered widespread flooding and landslides across the nation. It has emerged that last night a bridge was swept away by the swollen river it stretched across, leaving around 40 to 50 people missing in Madiun, East Java. Meanwhile, the total toll of those known or feared to be dead has reached 130.According to local police chief Supardi in a telephone conversation with Xinhua the flood waters weakened a foundation, resulting in the collapse. At least twenty motorcyclists, car drivers and passengers are thought to be dead, but as of midnight, no bodies had been recovered. However, three bikes have been retrieved. 100 rescuers have been dispatched to the scene. Continuing heavy rain forced the search to be abandoned temporarily. Java as a whole is the worst affected island; in addition to the bridge collapse most of the landslides occurred in two Central Java districts. Health ministry official Rustam Pakaya told reporters that at least 28,000 people have been forced to abandon their homes in central Java, although exact figures are not yet available. The Red Cross commented that 45,000 East Javanese people have been similarly displaced. Thousands are seeking shelter in mosques and other public buildings.Landslides buried houses and made roads impassable, while hundreds police officers, military personnel, local officials and volunteers have been digging with farm tools and even their hands to search for survivors. Heavy machinery is available but the road conditions have prevented it arriving at the areas where it is required. Jakarta has dispatched aid in the form of five tonnes of biscuits and instant meals, ten tonnes of baby food and multiple boats.Heru Aji Pratomo, head of the disaster management centre in the worst-hit district of Karanganyar has confirmed the recovery of twelve more bodies. This brings the total confirmed death toll in the area to 48. He said that most bodies were recovered from three metre deep mud and required heavy digging machinery to retrieve. 28 remain missing.Local resident Siswo told AFP "Suddenly I felt my house shaking, and I thought it was an earthquake. When I got outside, I saw that the houses next to mine were already covered by earth," and that it struck twelve neighbouring houses.In the next district, Wonogiri, disaster management centre head Sri Mubadi told reporters they had retrieved two more bodies, reaching a total of six, with eleven more missing. He also confirmed that they currently have no access to heavy equipment.In Tawangmangu about 1,000 rescuers were also searching for bodies and survivors without the aid of heavy machinery. Three more bodies were retrieved today.Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir toured a Karanganyar village, at which time he commented that he felt the disaster had been caused as a form of divine revenge, saying "This was likely caused by immoral acts going on here," and "This could be a lesson to be learned." The 69-year-old served two years after being linked to the 2002 Bali bombings, before having his conviction overturned last year.Chalid Muhammad, director of Walhi, an Indonesian environmental group, had a different opinion. "For five consecutive years landslides and floods have occurred in Java, claiming many lives. The main trigger is ecological destruction caused by deforestation, forest conversions and chaotic spatial planning," Chalid told Reuters."There have been no adequate efforts by the government to protect the people from disasters. When the landslides happened officials were on holiday and there was no access of heavy equipment to the affected areas."A Federal Air Marshal decided to exit a Southwest Airlines flight today after dropping ammunition on the aircraft floor.  The incident occurred at Chicago’s Midway Airport.After earlier arriving from Philadelphia, the Marshal was on board a Southwest Airlines jet bound for Kansas City, when his gun’s clip fell to the aircraft floor, spilling bullets.  According to Southwest Airlines spokeswomen Whitney Eichenger "He picked up the bullets immediately."  She also added, "Since he was no longer traveling incognito, he decided not to continue on the flight to Kansas City."Because of the incident, the flight was delayed 45 minutes.Onsite commentators are blasting the United States federal government, saying the response to Hurricane Katrina has been too slow and otherwise inadequate.Mayor Ray Nagin has repeatedly pleaded for more help.  The Washington Post reports that on the Friday after the storm, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco got a proposal from the federal government for her to request a federal takeover of the evacuation of New Orleans.  The state rejected that option hours later.  Blanco had declared a state of emergency on August 26.  Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has pointed out "our constitutional system really places the primary authority in each state with the governor." The city's police chief warned that storm victims were being raped and beaten on the streets.  Even in the Superdome stadium and the city convention center, where tens of thousands had awaited evacuation, fights had broken out, rubbish burned, and dead bodies have been left uncollected.  The Superdome evacuation was completed Saturday night.  The Superdome had been opened as a refuge of last resort for people who did not participate in the voluntary evacuation of the city before the storm. The head of New Orleans' emergency operations, Terry Ebbert, complained that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was not doing its job. "This is a national emergency. This is a national disgrace," he said. "FEMA has been here three days, yet there is no command and control. We can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims, but we can't bail out New Orleans."  Ebbert also said he hasn't seen "a single FEMA guy" at the Superdome Wednesday (the main staging area was 6 miles away along the adjoining I-10 at the Causeway intersection); the photo at right had been taken three days earlier by a FEMA worker before the storm.  FEMA estimated the damage in all states affected where 637,994 people usually live.Web pundits suggest that Mike Brown, the head of FEMA, will "be chosen to take the fall" for the poor response. [1]  A critic at the International Arabian Horse Association, which previously fired Mike Brown, said "He was an unmitigated, total...disaster.  I was shocked as hell when captain clueless (a reference to President G.W. Bush) put him in charge of FEMA a couple of years ago." [2]  It has also been suggested that the impact of the philosophy of privatization has damaged federal emergency response, but the validity of such claims has not been assessed. [3]Not all federal agencies are being blasted for their role in exacerbating the disaster.  In particular, the Coast Guard has been lauded for its rescue efforts, which began immediately.   There was been widespread criticism of the failure to mobilize National Guard units from other states.  Such units have now been deployed, but the debate over their slow deployment will rage for some time.  Sunday the Washington Post reported that Louisiana did not reach out to a multi-state mutual aid compact for assistance until Wednesday.A significant component of the criticism directed at federal and state governments has been the lack of access given to local volunteers and the Red Cross.[4]  Local officials, especially Mayor Nagin, have been harshly criticized for failing to follow existing evacuation plans.  In particular, aerial photographs show numerous unused city school buses, which were to have been used in the evacuation.Over twenty-five nations, some with assets in the area, have offered aid to the city of New Orleans, but the president has refused all material aid from foreign nations.  Such refusal of aid is not uncommon among nations with coldy hostile relationships, such as between the U.S. and Cuba or Venezuela, but it has created a stir among the European media.As of September 4th, the US has extended a "wish list" largely duplicating the offer from Germany.  German supplies, including an airborne hospital are expected to arrive September 5th.  The US has also asked the EU and NATO for assistance. [5]On Monday, a FedEx McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo jet flying from Guangzhou, China to Tokyo, Japan crash-landed at Tokyo's Narita International Airport at around 7 a.m. local time. The plane landed during high winds, and bounced twice upon landing before flipping over and bursting into flames. Firecrews were dispatched to the scene, and the airport was closed. The fire subsequently destroyed most of the aircraft. Incoming flights were diverted to other airports. Wind gusts around the time of the accident were 30 to 50 mph. The pilots, Kevin Mosley and Anthony Stephen-Pino, were taken to a local hospital where they were pronounced dead. A hospital official confirmed them as being American men. There were no others aboard the plane. The National Transportation Safety Board said it is deploying a team to Japan to assist with the investigation. The crash was the first fatal accident at Narita Airport, according to Japan's Ministry of Transport.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is being criticized for misallocation of personnel in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.  FEMA representatives said they requested volunteers from fire departments around the U.S., to handle its community relations campaign. However, a document FEMA sent to local fire departments asked for firefighters with very specific skills and who were capable of working in "austere conditions". Fire departments around the nation responded by sending crews to the FEMA staging ground in Atlanta.  Some of these crews were unaware that they were only going to be used for public relations work.  Others, however, merely hoped that FEMA would allocate them to rescue and damage control operations once it saw their qualifications.The firefighter's objections are particularly poignant as one of FEMA public relations training seminars coincided with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin plea for firefighters on national television, to relieve his own exhausted crews.  It is unclear if FEMA's request for firefighters prevented any municipalities from responding to Mayor Nagin's request.Some firefighters have objected to their use as FEMA public relations officers because their municipalities must bear the cost of their salaries, as well as endure reduced firefighting capacity.  FEMA has stated that it sought to use firefighters to avoid background checks required of federal employees.Firefighters began receiving their assignments Monday, September 5th.  Among these was a crew of 50 assigned to tour the devastated areas with President Bush and the press.The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is under fire after the agency held a fake press conference with fake news reporters in regards to individuals affected by the California wildfires and the assistance they could receive.The agency called a press conference on Tuesday, giving the press only 15 minutes to show up. When many did not, FEMA brought in agency officials to pose as fake reporters and ask questions. The option for reporters to call into the conference was also available, but the ones who did call in only got to listen to the press conference, and could not ask questions. No reporters were actually present during the conference, parts of which were carried live on Fox News and MSNBC.During the briefing, FEMA employees asked Deputy Administrator Harvey Johnson a series of what The New York Times called "decidedly friendly questions" such as "What type of commodities are you pledging to California?", "What lessons learned from Katrina have been applied?" and "Are you happy with FEMA's response so far?".  The briefing followed the format of a press conference, with FEMA's press secretary at one point cautioning that he would allow just "two more questions", then calling later for a "last question".  Officials who posed as fake reporters included the deputy director of public affairs Cindy Taylor and Director of External Affairs John "Pat" Philbin.  White House officials said that they do not condone FEMA's actions and also state that they had no idea that the conference was taking place."FEMA has issued an apology, saying that they had an error in judgment when they were attempting to get out a lot of information to reporters, who were asking for answers to a variety of questions in regard to the wildfires in California. It's not something I would have condoned. And they — I'm sure — will not do it again," said Dana Perino, the White House's press secretary in a statement.FEMA apologizes for the mishap and says that their intentions were only to get the information to the citizens of California."[The purpose was] to get information out as soon as possible, and in trying to do so we made an error in judgment. Our intent was to provide useful information and be responsive to the many questions we have received. We can and must do better," said Harvey E. Johnson, the agency's vice administrator.  "The real story -- how well the response and recovery elements are working in this disaster -- should not be lost because of how we tried to meet the needs of the media in distributing facts," a FEMA  statement said.FEMA is currently deciding whether or not any officials should face punishment for the incident. One of the officials responsible, Pat Philbin, is going on to be the new head of public relations for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. This is not the first time that the Bush administration has come under fire for planting reporters at press conferences. In February  of 2005, White House reporter Jeff Gannon was accused of being planted to ask softball questions to President Bush. FEMA itself had earlier undergone criticism during Hurricane Katrina for using disaster workers for public relations in 2005.Marty Bahamonde, the only FEMA emplyee in New Orleans during hurricane Katrina, testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, contradicts former FEMA director Michael Brown's testimony and says Brown ignored his pleas for help.In an August 31 Blackberry email:"Sir, I know you know that this situation is past critical. Here are some things you might not know.  Hotels are kicking people out, thousands gathering in the streets with no food or water. Hundreds still being rescued from homes" and "medical staff at the Dome expect to run out of oxygen in about 2 hours"In an email from one of Brown's aids:"Please schedule Joe Scarborough this evening... Also, it is very important that time is allowed for Mr. Brown to eat dinner. Gievn[sic] that Baton Rouge is back to normal, restaurants are getting busy"A suicide bombing in Iraq has killed at least 40 people and injured at least 72 more, according to local police. The suicide bomber, a woman wearing an abaya, a robe-like dress, struck near the entrance of a revered Shiite shrine Imam Moussa Al-kadhim Sunday morning in the Kadhimiya neighborhood. The attack comes during a Shia pilgrimage where many Iranians were celebrating the Shia holy Day of Ashura. Sunday's bombing came during Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, among the holiest months for all Shiites Muslims, who prepare to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, Prophet Muhammad's grandson, who was killed during a  680 battle in Karbala. A similar attack was perpetrated nine days after a December 26 car bomb exploded a minibus near the same holy shrine, which honors Khadim, considered the Seventh Imam, and killed at least 24 people and wounded 46 others.Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso won the first ever FIA 2010 Korean Grand Prix in Yeongam, South Korea. With two races to go, Alonso now leads the drivers' championship, closely followed by Mark Webber and Lewis Hamilton.As Typhoon Megi reached China, heavy rain hit Yeongam on Sunday afternoon and the race was red-flagged for about half an hour, before conditions improved. Both Red Bull drivers failed to finish despite starting first and second from the grid before and after race restarted. Webber ran wide and hit a wall, hitting Nico Rosberg's Mercedes, and Sebastian Vettel’s engine blew up during his spurt to the finish line leading the race. Hamilton changed places twice with Alonso behind Vettel, but finished second for McLaren. Alonso's teammamte Felipe Massa closing the podium on third place. Michael Schumacher drove his best race in this season for Mercedes overtaking Robert Kubica's Renault after the restart following the red flag. Schumacher finished fourth and Kubica fifth.Vitantonio Liuzzi placed his Force India on 6th place after his teammate, Adran Sutil, crashed in lap 47 after coming into contact with Kamui Kobayashi's {{w|BMW Sauber|Sauber}. Rubens Barrichello's Williams gets passes by both Kubica and Liuzzi to finish 7th ahead Kobayashi. The two German drivers of Sauber and Williams—Nick Heidfeld and Nico Hülkenberg closed the top ten.The situation in the season's standings has now changed in favour of Alonso—the Spaniard leads the driver's championship with 231 points, 11 more than Webber, who is in second place with 220 points. Hamilton and Vettel are third and fourth in the rankings with 210 and 206 respectively. Jenson Button has admitted he now has little hope of winning the title—he is in fifth with 189 points. The constructors' standings list is still dominated by Red Bull, who have 426 points, McLaren with 399 and Ferrari with 374. There are two races left until the end of the season, the first in Brazil, and the second a week later in Abu Dhabi.One hundred and thirty three people were injured, nineteen of them seriously, when two high-speed ferries travelling between Hong Kong and Macau collided in heavy fog on Friday. Ten crew members were also injured but no deaths have been reported.The two high-speed Boeing 929 - 100 Jetfoil hydrofoil ferries, Funchal and Santa Maria operated by Hong Kong-based ShunTak-China Travel Ship Management Limited (under the brand name TurboJet), collided five nautical miles away from Macau at around 8:30 p.m. local time. The incident has been confirmed by an official of the Maritime Administration of the Macau Special Administrative Region. In Shangai, a river ferry carrying twenty two people capsized in thick fog on Friday. Ten people are reported missing. Sixty six people were rescued after another ferry ran aground at Zhuhai near Macau.A ferry caught fire near Jakarta, Indonesia this morning. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said at least 23 had died and at least seventeen remain missing.The Zahro Express caught fire shortly after leaving Muara Angke port in Jakarta. It was heading to Tidung Island, in the Kepulauan Seribu chain. Police said the fire began in the engine area. A manifest listed 100 passengers, but officials estimated over 200 were on board. Sumarsono, acting governor of Jakarta, dismissed suggestions the vessel was overloaded. Its blackened wreckage was towed back to Muara Angke.Rescuers continue to search for bodies. As of earlier today, nine of the injured remained in hospital. Three bodies have been identified as Jaksen Wilhelmus, Masduki, and Alia. Jaksen and Masduki are both from West Java. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said ten ships continue to search for bodies or survivors."Fifteen minutes after the boat set sail, people at the back of the boat started making noise," one survivor said. "Then I saw smoke, there was more and more, the boat was crowded and people were fighting for life jackets." Another told Reuters passengers panicked when the fire broke out, and were met with a sudden conflagration when flames reached fuel.Boat accidents are common in the island nation. The National Transportation Safety Committee reported to The Jakarta Post today that shipping accidents were up from fifteen in 2015 to 28 in 2016. Lead marine investigator Aldrin Dalimunte told the paper some boats are well-maintained but run by poorly-trained crew who lack the motivation and knowledge to prevent accidents.A ferry has sunk in Bangladesh earlier today, killing at least five people, according to authorities. About fifty more people were missing after the incident.Police said that the accident occurred as the vessel, called the MV Coco-4, came near a river station at Bhola Island, located 300 kilometres from the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka. The ferry was reportedly overcrowded, and the boat tipped to one side as all its passengers moved to disembark."It was overcrowded with over 1,000 passengers. It tilted and part of it sank due to crowd pressure as it arrived near the Nazirpur river station," said a local police chief, Zakir Hossain, to the Agence France-Presse news agency. He also added that "many passengers have managed to land safely. But we believe some others who were staying in the cabins were trapped under water. We are trying to rescue them," Rescue teams and divers are reportedly searching underwater for bodies.Ferry accidents are not infrequent in the country; incidents have usually been due to overcrowding, or the use of old vessels. "At festival time it is really difficult to stop passengers and relevant ferry operators from flouting rules," said an officer for the Bangladesh water authority.The Sea Express One (formerly SeaCat Isle of Man) of the Isle of Man Steam Packet was hit twice, in heavy fog on the River Mersey at Liverpool by a tug towing the Alaska Rainbow cargo ship near the entrance to Alfred Dock, Birkenhead, at 11.20 on Saturday morning.None of the reported 294 passengers and crew were hurt, and the ferry is moored at Liverpool Pier Head while water is being pumped from the engine room. 80 cars remain on board, and passengers have been warned that some may have been damaged.While further north a plane was lost in the fog. Missing airplane may have been found.MV Suilven, a ferry in service in Fiji, capsized and sank in Suva Harbour today.Around thirty people, all crewmembers, were on board. Local media report all were rescued. The 41-year-old vessel previously saw service in Scotland and New Zealand.The ship capsized early this afternoon and sank within an hour. It had been converted from passenger to cargo use following its most recent sale, to Venu Shipping in 2012 or 2011. Local reports indicated police, the Navy, local tug boats, and volunteer rescuers all attended the accident.The converted ferry reportedly began to list on entering the harbour. It was working a route carrying cargo between Suva and the Northern Division.Built in Norway, in service from 1974, the ship served with Scottish ferry firm Caledonian MacBrayne until 1995, connecting the mainland town of Ullapool to Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis. It was ultimately replaced by a larger, faster vessel and was sold to Strait Shipping who used it until 2004 to ply New Zealand's seas, connecting Wellington to Picton and to Nelson.The name MV Suilven is in reference to the Suilven mountain in Scotland's Sutherland region.At least 28 people drowned and were confirmed dead, 46 were rescued, while 34 others remain missing on Sunday, after an overcrowded passenger motorboat capsized off waters in Ballesteros, a town of 17,000 people, the Cagayan police reported. 'M/B Mae Jan', a wooden-hulled ferry, was carrying 102 passengers, after an eight-hour voyage from Calayan Island in the Luzon Strait for Appari when it capsized less than 300 meters (984 feet) from its destination, at 8:30 p.m. Its bamboo outrigger broke due to strong waves, as it reached the mouth of the Cagayan River ('Bannag' Rio Grande de Cagayan, 'Ilog ng Kagayan'), along Barangay Linao, about 50 meters from the shoreline of Pallog village.Divers from the combined teams of the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard helped in the rescue operations. 11 of the fatalities, including the vessel owner, Arellano, and her daughter were identified. The police said  "there was a possibility that the boat was overloaded," saying that "there was also livestock on board."  Due to "trauma," the ferry's captain refused to talk to police.Meanwhile, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) formed a Special Board of Marine Inquiry (SBMI) to investigate the sea tragedy. It ordered the "immediate dispatch of SAR-003 and MCS-3005 vessels and the PCG Islander for aerial surveillance." PCG noted the  possible overloading of the vessel since the boat's franchise authorized it to carry only 40 passengers and 10 crew members.In November, a cargo vessel sank in rough seas north of Cagayan, and passing vessels rescued 16 of 20 passengers. Weeks earlier, separate storms sank two passenger vessels in the central Philippines, drowning more than 50 people.Prior to the ferry sinking, the Philippine weather bureau had issued Gale warnings to coastal towns, of approaching tropical storm "Ulysses" (international codename: Dolphin) from the Pacific with winds of up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour, centered off southeastern Catanduanes, eastern Philippines.Six applicants to join the Alabama Department of Corrections and their driver have been killed after the prison van they were traveling in collided with an 18-wheeled truck. Both vehicles burned at the scene.Andrew David Carter, who was driving the Lewis Trucking Company truck with a cargo of treated lumber, escaped the wreck without serious injury. He was briefly hospitalised and released. The deceased have been identified as driver Rodney Kelley, and applicants Julius Erving Douier, Lionel Michael Moore, John Henry Foye Jr., Brandon Jamaal Anglin, Henry Louis Simmons,  and Derrick Lamar Ivey. The oldest victim was 45 and the youngest nearly 19.The wreck occurred on Alabama's Route 82 near Bullock County, having left Bullock Correctional Facility to travel to Draper Correctional Facility in Elmore County for mental and physical fitness tests on the passengers before employment with the state.The road was closed for eight hours while bodies and wreckage were recovered. As well as the van and the truck cab, part of the trucks cargo and several hundred square feet of nearby timber land were consumed by the fire. An investigation is ongoing, but it appears that the truck crossed the center line and there are no skid marks present.The relatives of the victims will be offered counseling by the Department of Corrections.Nine people have died in a fiery tourist bus crash in Egypt on Thursday. The bus was carrying 40 North American and European passengers when it crashed in the Sinai peninsula.The bus left the road when it skidded off a tight bend and struck a concrete barrier, rolling over and catching fire. The bus ended the roll back the right way up and was completely destroyed by the fire. One wheel lay twelve metres from the main wreckage and skid marks were left on the road. The coach had been travelling from a resort at nearby Sharm el-Sheikh to the capital Cairo when it crashed at Abu Zenima, with some reports suggesting the cause was a blowout on a tyre.According to the Egyptian security official eight Russian nationals were killed, as was one of two drivers on board, both of whom were Egyptian. This was contradicted by Russian state owned service RIA Novosti, which stated just two Russians were among the dead. The Russian foreign ministry only said 16 Russians were injured and none killed, also contradicting the Egyptian security official who said only 14 people were injured in total. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said a Ukrainian woman had been killed and the Romanian foreign ministry said a 41-year-old Romanian woman was amongst the dead. The driver behind the wheel at the time survived the accident.The crash occurred at 6:00 am (0300 GMT) about 70km (45 miles) from Suez, and many of the injured were rushed to hospital there. Traffic officials, security personnel, civil defence soldiers and ambulances all responded to the crash. In addition, the Azure Travel coach, like all Egyptian tour buses, had at least one armed police officer travelling on board.Other injured passengers were taken to Sharm. Two Canadians and two British citizens are reported to be amongst the injured. The Brits are in a serious condition and one Canadian woman had her hand amputated. At least one person died in hospital. It is also reported that Italians were injured in the crash.Road accidents claim around 6,000 lives and injure 30,000 every year in Egypt. This high accident rate is fed by poor maintenance and regulatory enforcement and reckless driving, with many roads allowing high rates of speed to be achieved. A fog-triggered pile-up killed 29 in February, and 23 died in March in a head-on collision between two lorries.A seven story concrete apartment building in the Naniwanaka Naniwa Ward of Osaka, Japan was set ablaze, killing at least 15 people. The fire started early in the morning on October 1st in the Video DVD Cat sex shop on the first floor. At least eight people were rescued from the building, four of whom were seriously injured in the fire. Most of the injuries and deaths were caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. According to authorities, all of the fatalities were in private viewing rooms in a video shop that was located on the first floor of the building.The sex shop had 32 cubicles for watching videos, all of which were equipped with a bed, television, and video deck. Due to the beds, and a shower, shops like this are often used as cheap hotels. A customer, who fled to safety when the fire started, said to the media that the inside of shop was dark, and that he had difficulty seeing where he was going as he escaped.Witnesses said that they first noticed a burning smell at 2:30am local time, and that the fire was reported to Osaka Fire Department around 3am. 40 fire trucks and 120 firefighters took part in the efforts to bring the blaze under control. The fire was extinguished at around 4:30am, after burning for about one and a half hours. The cause of the fire is not yet known.Fifteen people were killed and twelve were injured after an eight hour hotel fire in Tuguegarao City, Northern Philippines, however police and firefighters managed to save many guests. Reports suggest the deceased sought cover in bathrooms where they were burnt beyond recognition.After entering the building firefighters were left in tears after finding the charred bodies of guests on the upper floors. "It's so close to Christmas, we wept when we saw their bodies," said fire investigator Daniel Abana. Nine of the deaths were confirmed to be nursing students from a nearby university. The students were in the city to take nursing exams. Nursing college instructor, Romeo Opido, told authorities that 36 nursing students from nearby provinces were at the hotel. Tuguegarao City counselor said, "It is very unfortunate that this happened just when they were about to take their exams." The other deaths were the hotel owner's and their family, including three children. The cause of the fire is still undetermined although it is known that the fire started on the ground floor and was energized by car tires and other combustible materials. It is also believed that paint cans were still in the building following a recent make over.A fifth child has died as a result of a police pursuit that ended in a crash in Dinuba, California on Sunday, August 9. Carlos Eric Salazar, aged 8, was the eighth victim to die as a result of the crash.On Sunday, four children were among seven that were killed when the pursued suspect who, after refusing to stop for police, slammed into the GMC Sierra pickup truck carrying a family, two adults and five children. The family was on their way to attend a football game for youths when the crash occurred. Four of the children were ejected from the truck and died at the scene. The two adults and one child were taken to Community Regional Medical Center located in Fresno.Both vehicles collided with lemon trees at an orchard near the intersection of Avenue 424 and Road 120 in Dinuba.  Three people, including the suspect, were in a stolen 2005 Dodge Neon and also died at the scene.  Their identities are not yet known as none of them were carrying identification.The other children were named Sienna Salazar aged 1, Michael aged 3, Monique aged 4 and Jocelyn aged 7. The two adults, Carlos Salazar Jr., 29, and Jennifer, 26, remain in the hospital where they are recovering from their injuries. None of the victims in the pickup were wearing seat belts, according to Fox News.Fifty people are feared to have drowned after a boat capsized in the Bagmati, an Indian river, on Tuesday, according to the government.75 people, mainly women and children, were aboard the vessel when it flipped over during a storm.  They had been returning from a fair that marked the end of the Durga Puja, an annual Hindu festival that celebrates the worship of the Hindu goddess Durga.Fifteen people were able to swim to safety, but it is unlikely the other passengers of the boat were able to survive, according to a report.An official from the district where the accident occurred said that "we have recovered 11 bodies so far and search is on for 40 other missing people. But their survival chances look very thin."A search operation was launched by the Indian National Disaster Response Force, but efforts were hampered by nightfall.Five people are thought to be seriously injured after a coach carrying elderly people overturned near Norwich International Airport, Norwich, Norfolk, England. 44 others have suffered minor injuries.Emergency services are reportedly at the scene, including at least seven ambulances. Norfolk Constabulary confirmed a "major incident" had occurred; it is thought only one vehicle, the single-decker coach, was involved. A statement released by the force said several people had become trapped in the vehicle in the incident, but all had been freed.A spokesperson for Norfolk County Council said: "A major incident has been declared. At this stage there is nobody left at the scene [...] As far as we can tell at the moment there have been no fatalities." The spokesperson added those with serious injuries have been transported to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital; others are being treated in a community centre near the site of the incident."I've seen four of five fire crews and at least seven ambulances going through to the scene of the crash, and they were still coming about an hour after the incident," reporter Cath Saunt, at the scene of the incident, said. "A couple of ambulances left the scene with blue flashing lights and people who do not need immediate treatment have been taken to a community centre."A Continental Connection flight from Newark to Buffalo crashed into a house about four to six miles from Buffalo Niagara International Airport on Thursday night, killing 50 people, officials said.Continental Airlines Flight 3407 is a daily commuter flight from Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey to Buffalo, New York, operated under the Continental Connection brand by Virginia-based regional airline Colgan Air.The Buffalo News has reported that the plane, a Bombardier Dash 8 turboprop with tail number N200WQ has crashed into a home located at 6038 Long Street, not far from the Clarence Center Fire Hall in the Buffalo suburb of Clarence Center approximately 10:17 p.m. EST (03:20 UTC), Thursday, February 12, 2009. Three people were inside the house.According to Becky Gibbons of New York State Police and Chris Collins County Executive in Erie County, New York, the total number of fatalities is 50, including 45 passengers, four crew members and a person on the ground, while a woman and daughter on the ground were injured, near the edge of farmland, about seven miles from Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Karen Wielinski, age 57, and her daughter, Jill, age 22 were brought to Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital in Williamsville where they are in stable condition in the emergency room. The father, Douglas C. Wielinski, 61 died from his injuries. Two volunteer firefighters are also being treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries. They are expected to be released later Friday morning.The crew member names have been released as of 8:20 AM EST, and are listed as: Captain Marvin Renslow, First Officer Rebecca Shaw, Flight Attendant Matilda Quintero, Flight Attendant Donna Prisco, and Captain Joseph Zuffoletto who was an off-duty crew member.One of the crash victims, Beverly Eckert, of Stamford, Connecticut and  widow of 9/11 terror attack victim, Buffalo native, Sean Rooney, was coming home for her husband's 58th birthday celebration. Her sister, Sue Bourque noted to The Buffalo News, "We know she was on that plane and now she's with him." Chris Kausner has said his sister Elise, age 24, a law student, was on board the plane. "I'm thinking about the fact that my mother has to fly home from Florida and what I'm going to tell my two sons," he said.The plane, which was carrying over 2.5 tonnes (5,000 pounds) of fuel, impacted a residence that was completely destroyed.  Amid rain and sleet, the ill-fated plane exploded into a huge orange fireball, sparking a large fire which emergency crews had to contain.  Twelve houses near the crash site were evacuated.The aircraft in question was on approach to land at the nearby Buffalo Niagara International Airport when it disappeared from radar.According to recordings from air traffic control, the pilot did not report any problem to approach control, and could not be contacted by the Buffalo tower after handoff.  "Can other planes see anything?" asked the traffic controller, but no one has responded.  The pilot's last comment was "Colgan Flight 3407," but there were no sounds of distress. The Buffalo News has reported that crew members aboard the flight from Newark Airport reported mechanical problems as they approached Buffalo. Weather conditions were reported to be a wintry mix in the area, with light snow, fog, and 17 mile per hour winds.In the 31-minute audio-recording there are conversations between the cockpit, air traffic control and other aircraft in the vicinity. Following take-off from Newark Airport, a female voice (pilot) in the 3407 plane's cockpit is heard informing air authorities that her aircraft was turning on approach to landing. The pilot stopped communicating at 2,300ft. "This aircraft was 5 miles out, all of a sudden we have no response from that aircraft," the controller declares. 21 minutes and 45 seconds into the recording, the control tower informs a JetBlue Airlines: "...apparently we have an emergency, I'll have to get back to you," reported The Daily Telegraph."It was cold, snowing and dark but these planes are designed to fly in icy conditions. However, those conditions can be very fickle and if ice builds up on a plane it can be very difficult. At this time of year, when a pilot crashes approaching an airport that they will know well, the first thing you look at is the weather,” said David Learmount, of Flight International.Continental Airlines Inc. said Colgan Air was in the process of collecting information. "Continental extends its deepest sympathy to the family members and loved ones of those involved in this accident. We are providing our full assistance to Colgan Air so that together we can provide as much support as possible for all concerned," said Larry Kellner, CEO of Continental Airlines since December 2004.The Bombardier Dash 8 a 74-seat is a twin-engined, medium range, turboprop airliner.According to the Ascend Online Fleets database, Colgan, a company of about 1,100 employees has a fleet of 15 Bombardier Dash 8's, along with 3 Hawker Beechcraft 1900D and 38 Saab 340B turboprops. Flight 3407's airplane was less than one year old and had flown for only about 1,500 hours, said Kieran Daly, of the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, saying that the doomed turboprop plane is one of the safest of its type.Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) has permanently grounded its Dash 8s fleet after three crash landings during a two-month period in 2007 caused by faulty landing gear. "Confidence in the Q400 has diminished considerably and our customers are becoming increasingly doubtful about flying in this type of aircraft," said Mats Jansson, SAS president and CEO. "I have decided to immediately remove Dash 8 Q400 aircraft from service," he added. "There is 'no indication of any security related event' that brought the plane down," said FBI spokesman Richard Kolko. Conditions of freezing drizzle, known as hard rime, were the most likely cause of the tragedy.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has announced that they would send a team to the crash site on Friday to begin the investigation. Lorenda Ward will serve as chief investigator with the assistance of NTSB Commissioner Steven Chealander and public affairs officer Keith Holloway. Ward has investigated several other plane crashes — including the 2006 New York City plane crash that claimed the life of New York Yankees pitcher Corey Lidle."We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic accident that occurred tonight in Clarence. Our focus right now is on supporting the first responders on the ground and their efforts to ensure the health and safety of people in the area," said Chris Lee, an Republican politician from Corning, New York, representing the 26th Congressional District of New York.The tragedy is the nation's deadliest disaster since the Comair Flight 191 crashed in Lexington, Kentucky in August 2006. Delta Air Lines Flight 5191 was a scheduled U.S. domestic passenger flight from Lexington, Kentucky, to Atlanta, Georgia. On the morning of August 27, 2006, the Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet 100ER that was being used for the flight crashed while attempting to take off from Blue Grass Airport in Fayette County, Kentucky, four miles (6 kilometers) west of the central business district of the City of Lexington. Financially, Continental is faced with volatile fuel prices amid a slowdown from the weak economy. It has posted losses of $585 million for 2008.A fighter jet crashed, killing the pilot, at Hat Yai International Airport, Songkhla​, Thailand this morning during an annual Children's Day airshow.The JAS 39C Gripen crashed onto a runway at around 9:30 am local time (0230 UTC) and exploded, closing the airport to commercial flights. The pilot was identified as Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee. Local media reports an airport fire vehicle rolled over while responding.Children screamed in video footage of the crash. The Royal Thai Air Force asked that images of the accident not be shared, but this has not deterred the press. Air Force spokesperson Pongsak Semachai said an investigatory commission would be formed. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha offered his sympathies to Pattavee's relatives.Thailand began purchasing the Swedish-built Gripen jets in 2008 and has twelve. None of its neighbours have similar aircraft, which cost the nation around 2.5 billion baht (US$70 million) each.Two Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets have collided in mid-air and at least one has crashed into houses near Moscow, Russia. One pilot has died and five people on the ground were injured in the accident near Zhukovsky Airfield.The jets were practising for the upcoming MAKS Airshow, which is set to start on Tuesday. Both were with the display team Russian Knights. Two pilots were able to eject safely and were rescued by emergency personnel; a third pilot, the Knights's commander, was killed.Reports are conflicting as to whether one or both of the aircraft subsequently crashed into nearby houses. Three houses were set alight and debris was spread over a large area. One woman is reported to have serious burns.The dead man has been identified as 45-year-old Col. Igor Tkachenko, a decorated officer in the air force.A final report released today by the Indonesian National Transport Safety Committee found that Adam Air Flight 574 crashed because the pilots were distracted by an instrument failure. The loss of the budget carrier's Boeing 737 into the sea near Sulawesi on New Year's Day 2007 left all 102 on board missing and presumed dead.The report found that the 737, registered PK-KKW, suffered a Inertial Reference System (IRS) failure. While pilots were troubleshooting for this navigational system they first unintentionally disconnected the autopilot, then failed to monitor other instruments informing them they were approaching the sea, crashing into it and destroying the aircraft.The flight had been a scheduled domestic passenger service between Djuanda Airport at Surabaya and Sam Ratulangi Airport at Manado, and disappeared from radar screens at 35,000 feet.National Transportation Safety Committee head Tatang Kurniadi told a press conference "This accident resulted from a combination of factors including the failure of the pilots to adequately monitor the flight instruments, especially in the last two minutes of the flight. Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System diverted both pilot's attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and bank angle to unnoticed..."The Cockpit Voice recorder revealed that both pilots were concerned about navigation problems and subsequently become engrossed with trouble shooting Inertial Reference System (IRS) anomalies for at least the last 13 minutes of the flight, with minimal regard to other flight requirements. This included identification and attempts at corrective actions."He also supplied a number of statistics concerning the final moments of the flight. Whilst in a right bank with sustained elevator input pushing up the nose the aircraft reached Mach 0.926 and 3.5g. The airspeed had reached 490 KCAS by the end of the recording. Investigator Santoso Sayogo said that the high speed impact caused the plane to disintegrate.Adam Air had suffered previous navigational problems. In 2006 another B737 suffered a navigational problem and flew into a radar blackspot, leaving it lost for several hours before performing an emergency landing hundreds of miles from the intended destination. Sayogo said today that in the three months preceding the accident the airline had registered 154 defects in PK-KKW's navigational equipment.The accident has had wide-ranging effects. The crash, coupled with Adam Air Flight 172, which snapped in half during a hard landing, and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which overshot the runway in Yogyakarta, killing 21, prompted the European Union to add all Indonesia's airlines to the list of air carriers banned in the EU. Earlier this month another Adam Air flight departed the end of a runway during landing, injuring five and damaging the plane. This prompted the authorities to ground Adam Air for three months after a regular evaluation, after which they may be permanently shut down. The airline is also in financial difficulty. All the accidents involved Boeing 737s.The United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Board (AAIB) yesterday blamed a release of ice in the fuel system of a British Airways passenger jet as the cause of a crash two years ago at London's Heathrow Airport. Flight 38 from China was attempting to land when both engines lost almost all power – a condition called "rollback".The exact phenomenon had never been previously identified, but it not only affected the British Airways jet two years ago but also a Delta Airlines jet above the United States later the same year. Both were Boeing 777 aircraft. That incident prompted the AAIB to collaborate with the US National Transportation Safety Board. BA 38 was approximately 43 seconds from touchdown when it experienced a dual engine rollback that was beyond the control of the flight crew. Captain Peter Burkill and co-pilot John Coward were later hailed as heroes for performing a successful crash landing 330 metres from the runway. The plane avoided nearby buildings and a road, leaving the landing gear deployed to act as shock absorbers. The jet slid 372 metres after the crash, but all 136 passengers evacuated alive. 36 passengers and twelve crewmembers were injured, mostly suffering whiplash and one incurring a broken leg. The report concluded there was no time to alert the cabin crew or passengers to the situation developing in the cockpit.The engine rollback was caused by ice forming in the fuel system; the ice came from water molecules existing as impurities in the fuel, and lined the fuel system. When extra fuel was pumped through to supply the engines for landing manoeuvres, the ice was dislodged. It is believed to have then settled on a component called the fuel-oil heat exchanger, a dual-purpose component that runs oil pipes through the fuel system. The idea is to cool down hot oil and keep fuel warm to prevent freezing. As the result of previous safety recommendations from both the UK and US investigators Boeing and engine company Rolls-Royce have worked to redesign the part.Every component of the aircraft complied with all relevant airworthiness standards, and the fuel also complied with the standards applying to it. Although ice problems have been known since the 1950s, sudden release problems were unheard of before the crash. The testing conducted as part of the investigation is thought to be unique and the aircraft experienced unusually low temperatures during the flight.A total of eighteen safety recommendations have been issued, of which nine came from an interim report and nine are new. Some of these apply to aircraft "crashworthiness" – the ability to withstand impact forces.Finland is considering toughening gun legislation in light of this week's Jokela school shooting. Nine people, including the gunman, were killed when Pekka-Eric Auvinen, 18, went on a shooting spree at his local school.Until now, Finland has actively resisted plans for all European Union member states to limit gun ownership to persons aged 18 and over. Currently, the law stipulates that Finns may apply for a gun permit at age 15.However, Anne Holmlund, Finnish interior minister, told reporters today that "Finland has changed its position to the EU firearms directive." Holmlund told the press that the intention is now to raise the age for ownership to 18, and require those aged 15-18 to be under parental supervision when carrying or using a firearm.Prime minister of Finland Matti Vanhanen had earlier commented that the shooting would likely cause a change in Finnish gun control policy, but Holmlund denied a direct connection. "There is no direct link (to the school shooting). ... It is important that our new position is clear," Holmlund said."We were the only EU member country that was willing to keep its regulations untouched and it was obvious we would be left alone." She added."As all other EU countries are ready to accept the age limit of 18 years for the acquisition of firearms ... Finland does not want to oppose the said amendment to the directive under the circumstances.""The cabinet is ready to agree on a proposal which says that those under 18 years old can use a gun only under parental or adult guidance," commented cabinet spokeswoman Sanna Kangasharju.Ministry spokesman Ilkka Salmi agreed that a potential change in legislation was being considered months beforehand, but added that, "It's obvious that this kind of tragic incident has probably sped up the decision."Auvinen had obtained a license for his .22 caliber handgun via a local shooting club just weeks prior to the attack, on October 19. He opened fire on students and staff shortly before lunch break was due to start, killing five students and two staff members with the gun, which he called 'Catherine' in internet discussions, before turning it on himself. He later died in hospital. There is also evidence he attempted to set the building on fire.Police have commented that he had apparently acted with intent to kill as many as possible, but selected his victims at random. The day prior to the incident, he posted a video on YouTube announcing his intentions. Police have also recovered a suicide note that said that he hated society.In related news, police are investigating after an internet posting claimed Kirkkoharju middle school in Kirkkonummi was going to be the subject of another attack. Police say they are treating the incident as a "bad joke".Finnish gun ownership per capita is the third highest in the world, due largely to a long tradition of hunting sports in the country, but fatal attacks are exceedingly rare. Around 13% of the 5.2 million inhabitants own a gun, with only the United States and Yemen having higher levels of gun ownership.The government of Finland has announced it will offer to send three specialist firefighting helicopters, 25 firefighters and 2-3 forest fire experts to Greece via the European Union to assist with the forest fire emergency Greece is currently experiencing.Greece is currently in urgent need of fixed-wing aircraft with water-bombing capabilities, assets which Finland does not posses. If the Greek authorities deem Finland's offers to be suitable, they will be dispatched with immediate effect, within six hours of Greece requesting the rotorcraft and personnel.It is thought that the men would most likely be put to use protecting built-up areas in an attempt to prevent the death toll, already over 60, from rising any higher.The helicopters have been sourced via a private company. Finland said that the country could not commit to send the aircraft any sooner without arrangements being made to cover their removal from service, as otherwise safety in Finland would be severely jeopardised, with emergency aircraft unavailable should Finland experience any fires of its own.The helicopters Finland have available can each carry up to 800 litres of water or foam retardant, whereas large firefighting planes can carry tens of thousands of litres.Finland had previously thought they would be unable to spare any help for Greece, and it was only after much sourcing of aircraft from the private sector that Finland was able to make the offer. Finland are also looking into whether they may be of assistance in reforestation efforts after the fires have been extinguished.A fire and string of explosions at a chemical factory in Iran have killed at least 30 people. State news agency IRNA says at least 38 more are injured at the facility near Shazand in the industrial province of Markazi.IRNA reports that a 60,000 litre chemical reservoir exploded to trigger the disaster, which may have been caused by nearby welding work.23 of the injured people are reported to have sustained burns across 70-100% of their body. It is unclear what was manufactured at the factory, with RTE reporting that it was a pharmaceutical plant, and Agence France-Presse saying the site was used to produce cosmetics and detergent.Local officials say the property has been almost completely destroyed, but the fire has been brought under control. The fire had rapidly spread from the building of origin to the rest of the complex, leaving roofs caving in and many vehicles burnt out. Some of the dead are charred beyond recognition.A fire broke out in the WABC-TV studios at 66th Street and Columbus Avenue in New York, New York. It started at around 11pm EDT Sunday evening, and caused programming to be suspended for over two hours. The New York Fire Department has put out the fire, which is described as minor.A witness says that a light bulb had set a curtain on fire just before the 11 o'clock news. News anchor Joe Torres said he heard "a light bulb blow with a loud bang". Moments later, the studio was evacuated.There were no injuries reported, but there was significant smoke and water damage to the studio.A fire at a drug treatment hospital near Almaty, Kazakhstan, killed it least 38 people on Saturday, authorities have said.Ten more people have been hospitalised, two of them in critical condition.The blaze started at approximately 05.30 local time (23.30 UTC) in Taldykorgan. The fire spread quickly, consuming almost 650 square metres of land."According to  tentative data, 38 people were killed, of which 36 were patients and two were medical personnel," the national emergency situation ministry stated. The ministry says that emergency crews managed to rescue up to forty people and medical personnel from the burning building.Emergency Situations Minister Vladimir Bozhko said that the inhabitants of the building may have been hampered in their escape by locked doors and barred windows.There was apparently no fire alarm on the premises, and firefighters had not been alerted to the fire quickly enough to contain it.In a statement on the Internet, Kazakh prime minister Karim Masimov called for a commission to investigate the cause of the fire: "The country's prime minister has entrusted the commission with carefully investigating the cause of this tragedy, and taking exhaustive measures to render assistance to the victims."A fire on Tuesday night at Southland Hospital, Invercargill has destroyed a two-storey building which was used for laundry and cleaning by the cleaning company Alsco. Junior doctors and interns were evacuated from the nearby hospital campus. A dangerous goods store nearby nearby was saved from the fire. The building was not close enough to the new main hospital building to cause any damage to it. Morris Robertson, Fire Chief, said: "We managed to save a dangerous goods store near the fire but the laundry is a total loss."Fire crews arrived at the scene at 9.30 p.m. (NZST) and Morris Robertson said that the building was well ablaze when they arrived. The first was so severe that they had to call in other firefighters to help, including volunteers. In total there was eight fire engines and 35 firefighters.The fire was under control by 11.30 p.m. but the fire crews stayed overnight, just in case.The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.A fire occurred on Saturday at Chester Zoo in Cheshire, UK, in a building the zoo says is the largest indoor zoological exhibit in the UK, at 11:30 a.m. local time (UTC). The only injury reported was a case of smoke inhalation. Some of the animals living there died.Chester Zoo opened in the early 1930s. It is now home to around 21 thousand animals from 500 species. Nearly two million people annually visit Chester Zoo, reportedly the largest annual draw of any zoo in the UK not in London. However, the fire caused it to shut down on Saturday.The monsoon forest habitat, where the fire occurred, housed, amongst other creatures, crocodiles, orangutans, macaques, and birds. In an attempt to replicate the conditions of South East Asia, it was kept at a temperature of 26.6°C (about 80°F). Reports passed on by witnesses indicated zoo personnel evaluated at least 40 animals from the area. The zoo reopened on Sunday.Although all the mammals reportedly survived, some of the frogs, insects, and small birds housed there died. The fire spread very quickly and strong winds helped the fire spread so fast. Reports suggested the fire was caused by an electrical fault.A fire broke out at a high-rise hotel in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) last night, apparently involving a large portion of the hotel. A crowd had gathered around The Address Hotel for the New Year’s celebration, but they were evacuated due to the fire. The cause of the fire was unclear, and there were conflicting reports on the number of people injured. A thick column of smoke rose up from the hotel, and two large explosions occurred during the fire. The smoke obscured the nearby Burj Khalifa tower, the tallest building in the world, according to Nadia Huraimi, a BBC correspondent in Dubai at the time, even though the tower was brightly illuminated.  Witness reports said the fire caused people to run away in panic. Firetrucks were dispatched to the hotel, and according to what officials said at 11 p.m., the fire had mostly been controlled. Despite this, the fire continued past midnight. Officials said guests at The Address would be given accommodation at other hotels.Reports on the number of people injured were conflicting. While officials said the fire injured sixteen people, lightly for the most part, an anonymous medic told Reuters the fire injured at least 60. Despite the fire, a fireworks show for New Year's continued as planned at the Burj Khalifa even as the hotel burned.Three buildings in Galveston, Texas, have gone up in flames as Hurricane Rita approaches. Winds in Galveston are currently around 60 to 70 mph as firefighters try to control the blaze from a distance. Most of Galveston has already been evacuated in anticipation of the hurricane. The cause of the fire is unknown.Fire broke out in the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, on the outskirts of Sydney, Australia, at approximately 5pm on Sunday 21st January 2007.  The site of the fire is inaccessible terrain in the Bobbin Head/Apple Tree Bay area.For a time properties were threatened in Mount Ku-ring-gai, but this danger has now passed.  The F3 freeway and northern train line were closed, causing freeway traffic to be banked up.  The morning saw delayed traffic on the F3, which was briefly opened, but for the most part traffic was diverted onto the Pacific Highway at the Berowra Exit.Around midday the F3 Freeway and Pacific Highway were closed until further notice, severing Sydney's northern vehicular links.  During Monday afternoon the railway line was closed. Traffic for the north was being routed inland via Wisemans Ferry Road, though Windsor.  The Pacific Highway, F3 and railway line reopened at 6pm.  Welfare centres have been opened for commuters who cannot get home.  They are located at Berowra Community Centre (north of the fire) and Thornleigh Baptist Community Centre (south of the fire).Overnight backburning along with a direct attack has seen the main threat dissipate with the southern fire front under control.  On Monday morning spot fires continue to move north towards Cowan Creek.  The wind has been picking up in the local area during Monday afternoon.  The fire is proving difficult to contain due to spot fires and flying embers.There has continuous helicopter activity over the area during Monday.The NSW Rural Fire Service will be holding Community briefings at the Berowra Oval and Samuel King Park Bobbin Head Road Turramurra at 5.30pm today (Monday).Tuesday saw continuing helicopter activity.  Steady rain has been falling throughout Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  The Rural fire service has stated that it is now confident that the fire will be contained.A fire broke out at the Trinity Cathedral in St. Petersburg, causing the main dome and another dome to collapse, early in the evening of August 25.Firefighters fought the blaze, and a helicopter was pressed into service. Staff, emergency service workers and passers by rescued treasured items from the cathedral.Four hours later, St. Petersburg emergency department spokeswoman Lyudmila Rubasova said the fires were contained but the remaining domes were damaged. Later a departmental spokesmen said that the fire was extinguished. "The main dome has been destroyed but we could not stop the fire because it was so high and now other domes are in flames," said a spokesman for Russia's emergencies ministry.The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but acting St. Petersburg emergency department chief Leonid Belyayev said the blaze seems to have started on scaffolding on the outside of the church, which was undergoing restoration.He also said that the most valuable icons and other items had been saved, and that structural damage beneath the roof area was minor.There are no reported injuries.A large fire has started at the Barangaroo construction site overlooking Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia. The construction company said fire broke out at about 2:10pm local time (0310 UTC) and appeared to have been caused by a welding accident in the basement of a building.All site workers were evacuated without injury, according to Fire and Rescue NSW Superintendent Ian Krimmer. Large clouds of smoke were continuing to pour out of the building, casting a thick pall of smoke over the city skyline. Some nearby buildings have also been evacuated, including the KPMG building and offices of the Macquarie Bank.Firefighters reported concern about a tower crane overhanging the building basement site. There were fears that the crane could buckle due to the heat and collapse. Firefighters were working to keep the base of the crane cool, and the stability of the structure was being monitored with lasers.The Western Distributor motorway was closed to traffic, and Sydney Harbour Bridge partly closed. There had been major disruptions in traffic and multiple roads in the Sydney CBD (Central Business District) were gridlocked. People catching buses were advised to expect long delays.A fast-moving fire engulfed the home of late singer Johnny Cash on Tuesday. The lake-side home, located in Hendersonville, Tennessee, was the home of the late singer and his wife, June Carter, from the late 1960s until their deaths in 2003.The home was purchased by former Bee Gees singer Barry Gibb in 2006, and was undergoing renovations at the time. The cause of the fire is unknown at this time, but it is believed that a flammable wood preservative that construction workers had applied contributed to the speed in which the flames spread. Firefighters responded within 5 minutes of the fire breaking out. No workers were killed in the fire, but one firefighter suffered minor injuries."Maybe it's the good Lord's way to make sure that it was only Johnny's house," said Richard Sterban of The Oak Ridge Boys, who lived down the road from Cash. Neighbor Marty Stewart said "So many prominent things and prominent people in American history took place in that house—everyone from Billy Graham to Bob Dylan went into that house." The home was where Cash wrote many of his hit songs, and appeared in the Cash music video for "Hurt".Fire crews in the Australian state of New South Wales are racing to contain two fires burning out of control in the Blue Mountains West of Sydney before an expected worsening of conditions on Tuesday.The fires which have been burning in the Mount Victoria and Blackheath since last Sunday have burnt around 2500 hectares of bushland. So far no homes have been under direct threat.The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has forecast strong North-Westerly winds in the area on Tuesday. These winds could fan the fire directly into the towns of Mount Victoria and Blackheath.In an attempt to contain the fires, fire personnel from the NSW Fire Brigade, Rural Fire Service and the National Parks and Wildlife Service have been undertaking backburning operations over the weekend. The backburning operations have been supported by fourteen aircraft, which have been carrying out waterbombing operations.As a result of the fire crew's operations, the Bell's Line of Road has been closed, with traffic advised to use the Great Western Highway.At least 170 firefighters in Berlin, Germany battled a fire on Tuesday at the Berliner Philharmonie, the building that is home to the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra.The fire broke out around 2:00 p.m. local time, while the orchestra was rehearsing, but all the members of the audience and orchestra made it out of the building without injury. Much of the instruments were also saved before the fire grew out of control.Firefighters had to take off large portions of the metal roof in order to battle the blaze which took almost five hours to bring under control and burned for almost 12. It is believed that welding on the roof may have caused the fire to start, but an investigation is ongoing. Officials have yet to determine the total extent of the damage, but do say that nearly 17,000 square feet of the roof is burned.The building, designed by Hans Scharoun,  was built in 1963 to replace the previous concert hall which was destroyed in 1944 during World War II. The orchestra was first formed by 54 individuals in 1882.All future concerts that have been scheduled to take place at the Philharmonie are canceled until further notice.Brasília, Brazil - An building of the Social Security Ministry (INSS)  in Brasilia was struck by fire Tuesday morning.Firemen report that the blaze was started by an electrical short-circuit.The INSS building was old and contained a large collection of state documents.At the time of the fire, the building was unoccupied except for security personnel. No one was injured during the blaze.Guests at a hotel in Northern England were evacuated in the early hours of this morning as a fire broke out, destroying the fourth floor and the roof. The upper floor of the King's Head Hotel in Darlington, County Durham was, at the height of the fire, engulfed by flames resulting in a large plume of smoke rising above the town. Sixty-three guests were evacuated from the building whilst two where rescued by the fire service but it is not thought that anyone was injured.Around sixty firefighters were involved in trying to bring the fire under control. Due to the danger of parts of the building collapsing they weren't able to fight the fire from within the hotel and instead broke holes in the roof and used a turntable ladder.Several roads surrounding the hotel were closed and the adjacent Cornmill shopping centre was for a time threatened by the blaze.Chief Inspector Paul Unsworth, of Durham Police praised the actions of the hotel staff: "I'd like to congratulate the hotel staff - they did a marvellous job during the night. There were no casualties and they managed to account for everyone in the hotel."A joint investigation between the local police and fire services has been launched but the cause of the fire is not expected to be known for several weeks.A fire on Thursday engulfed at least 140 buildings in Itoigawa, Japan. The inferno injured, by varying reports, at least eight people.The coastal town in the northern prefecture of Niigata's many traditional wooden buildings burned easily, fanned by winds of 56kph (35mph). Narrow streets hampered firefighters. "Sparks of fire flew around," one local resident recounted to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. "That's why far away buildings unexpectedly caught fire and it became large-scale.

"The first fire in the kitchen area was followed by three other separate fires within the complex," an MFS spokesman said.Refugee rights advocate Pamela Curr said she had concerns about the safety of detainees in the event of a fire because of the electronic doors. She said detainees at a detention centre at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport had been killed during a fire last month because authorities had been unable to manually open the electronic doors. "Thank heavens nobody seems to have been hurt today," she said. "We're always on the alert that Baxter is not a safe detention centre".Bernadette Wauchope from Rural Australians for Refugees says the destruction will continue until something is done. "They become so desperate that they attempt self-harm or attempt suicide or maybe resort to lighting fires," she said. "After being locked up for years and years the feeling that they're isolated and that nobody's listening to what their stories are, often that, well it does contribute to these kinds of acts," she said.Despite earlier cooler weather, heatwave conditions are expected to resume in New South Wales, Australia. Local weather service forecasts expect temperatures to rise above 40°C (104°F), as-experienced earlier in the week. The percentage of uncontained fires jumped as high as 20%. On Friday, local fire authorities have declared total fire bans across Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Fire crews at the east coast of Australia are readying to battle an increased rate of bushfires during the weekend.Uncontrolled fires have also been burning across the states of Tasmania, Victoria, and Queensland.Extremely hot weather and strong winds played havoc with the fires early in the week. A minor change in the weather assisted crews on Thursday but the high temperatures are set to return on Friday and through the weekend.Thirty devastating fires in Tasmania are now being controlled after burning 130 properties and 110,000 hectares of land throughout the past week.In Victoria there are two significant fires being fought with several others now under control but concerns remain for the weekend with the temperature forecast to rise to 42°C in the north of the state.Queensland firefighters continued to battle fires north of of the capital Brisbane on Bribie Island, with at least 22 fires still burning throughout the state.New South Wales has 120 fires burning as of Friday with 370,000 hectares of land, 10,000 livestock and one property already destroyed.Deputy Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, Rob Rogers briefed reporters on the bushfires at the Rural Fire Service Headquarters on Friday."They are very large, all either in excess or very close to 10,000 hectares (and) in some cases 100 kilometres of fireline.That's an awful lot of fireline for firefighters to monitor and obviously that's going to be troubling over today and particularly tomorrow when it will be even hotter."One fire at Dean's Gap in New South Wales had authorities concerned due to its proximity to an old military range that contains unexploded ordinances at Tianjara plateau. Firefighters have used earth moving equipment to create containment lines and specialised gel to protect the range.After two days, the 2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire has finally been extinguished. The fires began after a series of explosions early on the morning of 11 December 2005. The terminal, known locally as the Buncefield Depot, is an oil storage facility located near Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. These were some of the largest explosions ever to occur in the country and the incident has been described as the biggest of its kind in peacetime Europe. The Hertfordshire Fire Service chief Roy Wilsher said: "There are still some small bund (concrete container) fires, but the tanks are out." Fire crews would remain at the scene over the next few days cooling the area to ensure fires did not break out again, he said. A few residents are being allowed to return to their homes within an exclusion zone set up around the site.A 67-year-old man, Thomas Ouellette, of Bonita Springs, Florida was questioned by the FBI Monday after he brought fireworks onto an airliner. Piedmont Airlines flight 4126, a Bombardier Dash 8, from Baltimore, Maryland landed safely and without complications in New York's LaGuardia Airport. No suspicions were raised until cleaning crews found the pyrotechnics on the airplane.The fireworks are currently being held as evidence by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police, owner of LaGuardia Airport. Ouellette has been issued a summons to appear in federal court. Pyrotechnics are banned on American flights and individuals face a $10,000 civil penalty for bringing them on board.This case comes after an incident on December 25 when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian national, attempted to bomb an airliner with explosives concealed in his underpants.Pichilemu, Chile — Pichileminian fishermen found the body of a child on Sunday evening on the beach of Pichilemu. It is another victim of the earthquake and tsunami combo that hit Pichilemu, and many other areas of Chile, in February 27, and later, the March 11 Pichilemu earthquake.The fishermen were roaming around the coastline, in Chorrillos, when at the 1:00 PM (17:00 UTC) they found the body of a person. They immediately called the police. The Fiscal of Pichilemu, Pablo Muñoz, asked for the presence of the Investigations Police.The cadaver was moved to the Morgue of the Pichilemu Hospital, where it is being examined. It is known that the child was between three and six years old. The body will be taken to the Servicio Médico Legal in Rancagua, where it will can be identified.The police believe that the body might belong to one of the persons that disappeared in the tsunami of the rural area of Chorrillos, when two children and an adult were missing.At least five people have been killed after an arson attack on Monday in Zahedan, a city in southeastern Iran. Tens more people were injured at a local subsidiary of the Mehr Financial and Credit Institute.The casualties were all reported to have been employees of the subsidiary."Security has been restored to the city and we have everything under control," said Ahmad Reza Radan, the Iranian deputy chief of police.The Mehr News Agency quoted a senior police official as stating that the attack comes from rebels who want to shake Sunni-Shiite relations in the country, in the time before the national presidential elections, which are due on June 12.The incident comes only five days after an attack on a Shiite mosque in the same city killed 25 and injured 125.File:GMC Safari.jpgFive people are dead and ten more are in a critical condition after a minivan packed with children rolled over on Louisiana's Interstate 10 highway yesterday.  The vehicle's driver lost control after a blowout near Baton Rouge.The vehicle's driver, who was among the dead, and a front-seat passenger were the only ones wearing seatbelts. There were thirteen children travelling in the back although there were not enough seatbelts and the van likely only had enough rear seats for ten, according to the Louisiana State Police.The front driver's side tire on the GMC Safari blew out as the vehicle moved west. The driver lost control of the swerving van, which sideswiped a delivery truck travelling alongside before bouncing across to the center median, where it flipped. It rolled around 200 feet (75 yards) across the median before landing upright in the opposite lanes. Most of the occupants were ejected and four dead children were found lying in the median. No other vehicles were involved and the trucker pulled over uninjured.Several of the victims were members of the same family from Harvey, 75 miles from the wreck. A three-year-old was amongst the dead. The survivors have been taken to two Baton Rouge hospitals and all are in a critical condition. A CNN photograph showed debris strewn around the scene. "I just saw the vehicle flip about three or four times and kids flying everywhere. It looked to be about 10 to 11 kids out of the car," said eyewitness Tammy Hall.Although drugs and alcohol are not believed to have been involved police have confirmed samples will be taken from the driver to check. The road was closed for two-three hours in both directions. None of the victims have yet been publicly identified.A small plane has crashed at a New Mexico airport killing five people. The Cessna U206F (tail number 	 N2905Q) had just taken off when it crashed at the Santa Rosa Route 66 Airport.The plane caught fire after the crash. It was a single-engined private aircraft headed for Chicago and Federal Aviation Administration records show it was registered in Gilbert.The deceased have been taken to the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator in Albuquerque. Their names have not been released until they are formally identified.Investigations are ongoing.The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Monday about 500 migrants may have been killed in a deliberate sinking in the Mediterranean Sea last week. The unverified claim comes after IOM debriefed two Palestinian survivors.In a statement, IOM said, "If this story, which police are investigating, is true, it would be the worst shipwreck in years". The organization added, if the story would be revealed as true it would be "not an accident but a mass murder, perpetrated by criminals without scruples or any respect for human life". IOM Spokesperson in Italy Flavio Di Giacomo told AFP, "Two survivors brought to Sicily told us that there had been at least 500 people on board. Nine other survivors were rescued by Greek and Maltese ships, but all the rest appear to have perished".According to the two survivors, the boat, which departed on September 6 from Damietta, Egypt bound for Malta, sank in the Mediterranean Sea last Wednesday when people smugglers rammed it; drowning the vast majority of its 500 plus passengers, including refugees from Egypt, Sudan, Syria and Palestine. They said the smugglers had become angry when the passengers refused transfer to a smaller vessel that they doubted could carry them. The Palestinian ambassador to Malta, Jubran Tawil, said three Palestinians who had been on board the boat have been rescued with aid from Panamanian ships and flown to Malta by a Maltese helicopter together with some of the dead.According to UN data, this year the number of migrants by sea to Europe exceeds 130,000, up by 50,000 from last year. Many people from North Africa and the Middle East attempt to reach Europe on overcrowded, unsafe boats. Over 2,500 people on this journey have drowned or disappeared this year, 2,200 of them since June.Five people have been injured in an explosion at a pub in Leeds, United Kingdom. The pub is situated in the Burmantoffs area outside St James's Hospital. One of the injured said that she "heard a bang and when I got to the main entrance the whole pub was gone." The pub was reportedly not in use at the time of the explosion.A spokesperson from St James's Hospital commented on the incident. "I believe there has been damage to a pub which has closed down and is boarded up," she commented. Another eyewitness said that "It was really loud and lots of people were screaming," when talking to the BBC.Further eyewitness statements said that "it is lucky there are not more injuries. It could have been a lot worse," and  "we [local residents] are being kept well away from the scene as I think there are fears of a second explosion."On Monday, five people were injured after a Boeing 737-400, operated by Adam Air, overshot the runway today while landing at Hang Nadim Airport on the island of Batam in Indonesia.The aircraft skidded 75 metres (245 feet) into a grassy field after touching down in rainy conditions. Damage was done to the right wing, hydraulics and main landing gear. The plane came to rest with the nose in the air and leaning towards the right.Of the 176 passengers (one source says 174) and crew on board, five passengers required treatment for neck and head injuries.Adam Suherman, president of the airline, said the plane had skidded 10 metres beyond the extreme end of the runway. He also gave the time of the crash as 10:40 and noted that the plane was currently resting on soft ground.Suherman gave the registration of the aircraft as PK-KKT. This would make the aircraft the one Boeing gave the serial number 24353 and owned by CIT Group Incorporated.Adam Air spokesman Danke Drajat described the plane as having been in "good condition" at its last major inspection in December. He suggested the weather condition may be to blame for the crash, the third to strike the budjet carrier in just over a year. On New Year's Day in 2007 Flight 574 crashed into the sea, leaving 102 missing, presumed dead. The following month the fuselage of Flight 172 cracked in half during a hard landing. Both involved Boeing 737 aircraft.Pantun Banjarnahor, Hang Nadim Airport's chief of operations, said that visibility was adequate for a safe landing. The airport was closed for over two hours. It is unclear how many flights were affected.The National Transportation Safety Committee is investigating.A Mandala Airlines Boeing 737-200 overshot the runway at Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport, East Java, Indonesia after a domestic flight from Jakarta. Five passengers were injured in the incident, none seriously.The aircraft's nose landing gear is understood to have separated in the incident, in which the aircraft skidded 260 feet from the end of the runway. Five of the 89 passengers and seven crew on board received cuts and bruises during the emergency evacuation that followed. It was raining heavily at the time, although it is not known if this is considered to have played a factor.Airport official Suradi described the scene to Reuters via telephone: "The plane now lies abandoned on the runway ... Its head is slightly tilted down because the front wheel broke off."The accident is currently under investigation. One potential cause being looked at is the fact that the forward landing gear axle is believed to have snapped upon landing, setting off the chain of events.The Indonesian aviation industry has been the subject of much criticism this year over safety concerns, sparked by a string of accidents including Adam Air 574, which crashed into the ocean, killing 102, Adam Air Flight 172, a nonfatal accident where a plane snapped in half, and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which overshot a runway at extreme speed, killing 21. All Indonesian airlines are on the list of air carriers banned in the EU, and the United States Federal Aviation Administration has downgraded Indonesia to its lowest safety rating.Mandala's only fatal accident was the crash of Mandala Airlines Flight 091 in 2005, which killed 112 people.Five schoolgirls, all between thirteen and sixteen, have died in a bus crash in County Meath, Ireland. The three vehicle crash, involving a school bus carrying fifty-one teenagers and two cars, occurred at 4.30pm on a straight section of the Navan to Kentstown road.Apart from the five fatalities, six children in a critical state and nineteen others with less serious injuries have been admitted to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. Six more teenagers, also in a critical state, and twenty others with lesser injuries have been admitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, County Louth.The bus was carrying secondary school students from four schools home when the accident occurred. At present it is unknown what caused the accident - but it is suspected that the two cars collided head on and the bus then attempted to swerve in order to avoid them, causing it to topple over. Several investigations have begun; including one by the Gardaí and one by Bus Eireann.The accident was quickly responded to by an emergency plan which lead to fourteen ambulances, several fire engines, squad cars and a few helicopters arriving on the scene within minutes.Five people have been killed when two light aircraft collided near to Coventry Airport in Warwickshire, England. One of the aircraft, a Cessna 402 carrying four people, crashed near Brandon Woods whilst the other, a smaller single engine aircraft with only the pilot on board crashed a mile away near to Coombe Abbey, Brinklow.The crash occurred shortly after 11:30 BST this morning as both aircraft were returning to land at the airport.The Cessna aircraft is owned by the RVL Group and was based at Coventry. All of those on-board were employed by the company and were carrying out survey work for a private agency. Colin Dennis, managing director of RVL Group, said, "Of the four people on board the aircraft, there were two males and two females. Three of them were highly-experienced full commercial pilots. Two people were operating the flight, and the third pilot was assisting in the back with survey work, with a highly skilled survey engineer." "It’s a very difficult time because we are a very small company, a family kind of company. It’s an absolute tragedy that they should have been killed while doing this routine work."Spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service, Murray MacGregor, said that the ambulance crews met "quite a scene of devastation". "Sadly there was nothing that could be done other than the grim task of confirming the deaths of the five people", he said.Warwickshire Police, Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service, and the Air Accident Investigation Branch have launched a joint investigation. The police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.Five men out of six accused of involvement in the September 11 attacks have been referred to trial by the Guantanamo military commission. The war crimes tribunal also dropped charges against Mohammed Qahtani, who is alleged to have been the '20th hijacker', although they were dropped "without prejudice" so the Saudi Arabian can still be re-charged.All six men are currently being held in maximum security at the United States naval base at Cuba's Guantanamo Bay. Under the 2006 Military Commissions Act those charged must be arraigned within 30 days and have their trial commenced within four months.The men are accused of plotting the attacks, in which four passenger airliners were hijacked in US airspace. One was flown into each tower of the World Trade Center, one was flown into the Pentagon and the fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field. Almost 3,000 people were killed. 19 hijackers were involved, with one aircraft having four hijackers compared to five on the others, triggering theories concerning a 20th hijacker. It is alleged that Qahtani missed out on this role because he was unable to get past anti-immigration measures to upon arrival in Florida, where head hijacker Mohammed Atta is said to have been waiting.Those who are set to go to trial are alleged members of Al-Qaeda, who were found to be responsible for the attacks. They are Walid bin Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi and alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.They have all been charged with conspiracy, murder in violation of the laws of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property, terrorism and material support for terrorism while all but Hawsawi are charged with hijacking aircraft as well.Some concern has been made over alleged human rights abuses. Officials have said themselves that Qahtani was harshly treated in imprisonment and Khalid was subjected to waterboarding.Qahtani also withdrew an earlier confession saying it was obtained from him under torture. He submitted a detailed written account describing abuse he alleges against him including beatings, being forced into uncomfortable positions for long periods, threats with dogs, exposure to music at high volume, being subjected to freezing temperatures and being forced to appear naked in front of female personnel.The arraignments will take place at the high security Guantanamo war crimes tribunal, and will mark the first public appearances of the men since their capture. The trial will mark the first in front of a US war crimes tribunal since World War Two, and the first capital one at this tribunal as prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for all of the men.Five of the six defendants accused of manslaughter over the 2006 fire on board Egyptian ferry al-Salam Boccaccio 98 have been cleared of all charges. The February 3 fire and subsequent sinking killed 1,034 of around 1,400 passengers.Mamdouh Ismail, owner of the al-Salam company, his son and three company executives were all cleared of manslaughter. Ismail is a member of parliament directly appointed by the president, and both he, his son and another of the executives were tried in absentia as they have left the country. They had all been charged with manslaughter stemming from safety violations on the ship.Convicted was Salaheddin Gomaa, captain of nearby ferry Saint Catherine. He was jailed for six months after the court found he did not come to the stricken al-Salam 98's aid. It found he "did not do his duty by failing to go to the rescue of victims," and that he failed to show any compassion.The ship went down in the Red Sea near Egyptian port Safaga, where the trial was held, having departed earlier from Saudi Arabia's Dhaba port. A parliamentary report balmed the disaster's scale on the owners, as well as the government and Panama, the state where the ship was registered. The report said al-Salam had kept operating the ship "despite serious defects" with her, and that the government had "failed to manage the crisis adequately" in the following days.It was found that the 36-year-old al-Salam 98's safety documents were forged, that the ship's extuinguishers and life rafts were not fit for purpose and that there were an inadequate number of winches to lower the rafts into the sea. However, the elder Ismail had put the blame on his ferry's captain, who he claimed wrongly believed the crew could deal with the fire when it broke out. The captain was amongst the dead.Ismail's assets were frozen and a travel ban was imposed on him following the disaster, but both were lifted later that year after he paid E£300,000,000 (US$57,000,000) into a victim's compensation fund. Many victims were poor Egyptian migrant workers, and some were bringing home savings accumulated over months or years.The Misdemeanor Court's acquittal of all except Gomaa — who was fined E£10,000 (US$1,887) — met with anger from relatives, who turned out en masse to hear the verdicts. One man told al-Jazeera "The day of the accident everybody saw that the ship was in bad shape and two years later they say the boat was in good shape. It doesn't make sense. This is awful. My wife and children died and after two years everyone responsible is found to be innocent."Public prosecutor Abdel Meguid Mahmud was also unhappy with the result. In a statement he said he intends to appeal the verdict and demand a retrial. He alleges serious "violations in documented records, corruption in investigation, shortcomings in validatings and arbitrary conclusions," and cites these as his reasons for a retrial.Five tourists including a child, have been killed in a car accident in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Four of the tourists were from Austria and one was from Germany. The driver survived the crash with minor injuries.On Thursday November 29, the tourists were traveling in a Mercedes-Benz 4x4, near a gate to the park when the driver "miscalculated" the turn onto a bridge crossing the Letaba river, causing the car to plunge over the edge, flip over and fall into the river below with the roof in the river's water.No names have been released as authorities are attempting to contact the family members of those killed. It is not known if the driver will be charged.A large explosion rocked an industrial area in the largely Christian area of Bawshriyeh, east of the Lebanese capital of Beirut. The blast occurred at approximately 21:30 local time on Saturday. It is believed that five people have been wounded, two have died, and that three buildings were set ablaze.An unnamed Lebanese security source stated that a car rigged with explosives was the cause of the explosion. No group has of yet claimed responsibility.This is the third blast to have targeted Lebanese Christians in a little over a week, and the anti-Syrian opposition representatives were quick to blame Syrian-backed elements. Opposition leader Walid Jumblatt told Lebanese television channel LBC, "They will use all means to try to destroy national accord. It is true that today they are targeting Christian areas but before that they targeted Hariri."Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated in February after a car-bomb attacked his convoy. Hariri had been a vocal critic of the Syrian presence in Lebanon. The attack intensified internal and international pressure on Damascus for a withdrawal of Syrian forces. There had been around 14,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon.West Mercia Police have made the announcement that a five-year-old girl that was physically involved in a crash involving a car going into a river has died in Birmingham Children's Hospital, United Kingdom. The child has been identified as Gabrielle Grady. She was also known as Gabby.Gabrielle was involved in a vehicle crash on Thursday when the car she was in crashed into the River Avon in the town of Evesham in Worcestershire, England.  There were three occupants in the Vauxhall Vectra, including Gabrielle, her six-year-old brother Ryan, and her 41-year-old father Chris Grady, who was driving the vehicle.  It took 12 minutes for divers to free Gabrielle from the car, which was partially underwater.West Mercia Police announced on Sunday that Gabby had died in Birmingham Children's Hospital at approximately 1330 (1:30 pm) GMT that day. From the time of her entry into the hospital, she was considered to be in a critical condition. Her family was with her at the time of her death. West Mercia Police also commented that Ryan was still recovering in the hospital.This incident is currently being treated as suspicious, with Chris Grady being remanded in custody for offences of attempted murder. The police have stated that this incident is currently being handled as a murder investigation.The New Zealand Department of Conservation (DoC) has blamed a flaming possum for causing a big fire yesterday at the skifield in The Remarkables, Queenstown, New Zealand.The possum attempted to run across two power lines and caught alight and then fell into some dry tussock. Nick Edwards, spokesman for Wakatipu DoC, said that it was not the first time a possum on fire has started a fire, even though it does sound unusual. Mr Edwards said that the possum never stood a chance of surviving.The fire burnt 50-hectares in the Rastus Burn Recreation Reserve. It took crews of firefighters and three helicopters twelve hours to bring the fire under control.A crew of firefighters and one helicopter will stay to prevent any flare-ups.A state of emergency was declared on the island of Evvoia in Greece on Saturday after flash flooding resulting from heavy rains flooded dozens of homes and businesses and killed at least one person.The single casualty from the flooding was a 39-year-old policeman in the city of Kymi, whose car was overtaken by a flash flood and swept into a river.The mayor of one of the island's town told local news that water depth had reached 1.5 metres (5 feet).According to local officials, tens of buildings were flooded, and considerable damage was done to main roads, some of which were cut off. A bridge also collapsed due to the torrential rains.14 people have died after heavy rain and flash flooding hit a gorge near the south western city of Chongqing, China. It is reported that a group of hikers entered a forbidden area of the Tanzhangxia Gorge along with a guide. 16 members of the group of 35 were rescued but 14 died and 5 are still missing. The flooding was caused by a heavy rainstorm on Saturday which caused a wall of water to trigger down the gorge. One survivor said the water was “several meters high”. Deng Ke survived by grapping a bamboo shoot. Around 400 rescue workers are helping the rescue effort and looking for any possible survivors. Several homes and streets were flooded during the rainstorm despite the effort of the villagers who built temporary flood guards. Rescue efforts are ongoing.Search and rescue workers in Arkansas continue to search the Little Missouri and Caddo Rivers for survivors of Friday's flash flood. At least nineteen people were killed when the flood swept through the Albert Pike Recreation Area campground in the Ouachita National Forest in the southwestern portion of the state.Initially, Arkansas governor Mike Beebe said twenty people were killed when the flash flood reached its peak at about 5:30 a.m. local time on Friday morning, but as of Monday the death toll stands at nineteen. Amongst the dead are at least six children under seven who died when what has been described as a "wall of water" swept away campers while they slept.With no record of who and how many people were at the camp site, rescue workers initially thought up to 40 people were missing, estimating numbers from vehicles and camping equipment remaining. Temporary cell phone towers have been erected in the area, in the hope that survivors would be able to call for help.Speaking to CNN on Saturday, Bill Sadler, an Arkansas State Police spokesman, said: "We believe there are still individuals trapped in the area." He added that "The primary mission of the Arkansas state police working with the local authorities right now is to get the living out of that area and locate the dead." Most of those who had thought to be missing have now been accounted for.Survivors describe having to cling to trees to avoid being swept away. Others escaped by climbing into higher ground. Rescuers hope that those missing can still be found alive on these higher grounds. The flood swept away everything from automobiles to RVs and, though it pales in comparison to floods like to much bigger flash floods like the Big Thompson Canyon flood in Colorado of 1976 that killed 144, many people at the site of the disaster said they "had never heard of anything like this."Surrounded by mountains, the camp site "filled up like a bowl", according to Chad Stover, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. The area where the flooding happened is known as a "flash flood alley". This is due to the hilly topography, which creates a bowl like effect that drains rainfall into smaller streams. That means if there's a lot of rainfall, it will all go into the streams that can flood very easily.Before the actual torrent of water came, the waters of the Little Missouri river increased at a very rapid rate. At 2:00 a.m Friday, the waters of the Little Missouri river were just 3.8 feet, according to US Geological Survey river gauge logs. However, it surged to 10 feet over the next hour and peaked at 23.4 feet, which is almost 20 feet above the river's norm. It also exceeded the river's previous record by 10 feet. After the peak, the river dropped back to 8 feet by noon. Raymond Slade, a Texas-based U.S Geological Survey hydrologist and an expert on floods, said that the amount of rainfall could have exceeded seven inches in an hour, a phenomenon so rare that scientists call that a "100-year rainfall". Slade says that "This was much greater than a 100-year rainfall. That flood that occurred was much bigger than a 100-year flood, where those people were camped."Five hundred people are missing and as many as 150 are reported to have been killed by flash floods in India, caused by a sudden cloudburst that hit Indian-controlled Kashmir on Friday. The downpour struck the town of Leh and several surrounding villages, and reportedly caused a mud slide that hit the refugee-populated village of Choglamsar.Associated Press reported that at least five foreign tourists were among those killed. Their nationalities are not known but New Delhi Television (NDTV) reported that 110 tourists, half of them foreigners, were being looked after at an Army transit camp on the Leh-Manali road. NDTV also said that the tourists had been given food, medicine and phone connections to their embassies. Flights have been arranged by the Indian government to bring affected foreign tourists back home. Massive relief efforts are continuing; Farooq Ahmad, who is Inspector General of Police in Kashmir reported on Sunday today that "63 bodies had been identified so far and that rescue teams were fanning out to six villages near Leh that had not yet been reached during relief operations." Believed to contain 5000 people, Choglamsar, on Leh's outskirts, is one of the villages that rescuers have been clearing roads to reach. The army has been called in to assist in rescue work. Thousands of troops, police and paramilitary soldiers were clearing roads in order to reach isolated villages. Those living in the upper reaches, whose housing was not adequate to provide protection, will have borne the full impact of the mud slides caused by the 12 mm of rain that fell on Friday in just a few minutes. Officials said that rescuers were digging through crushed homes and piles of mud to search for survivors. The hundreds of reported injured are being treated at an army hospital and several makeshift clinics. Mohammed Deen Khan, a social activist who has been assisting in rescue work, said the mud was 15 feet high in some places. Heavy earth-moving equipment has been brought in to move the tonnes of mud and boulders blocking roads.The rescue officials have faced a serious problem due to the severe damage of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) office, a telecommunication enterprise, leading to the complete disruption of communication in the Leh region. The general manager of BSNL reports that the damage has caused a loss of 120 million INR. Another telecommunication enterprise, Airtel, has provided SIM cards to local administration for setting up hotlines that people can call for assistance.Pashi Tsetan, a local administration development wing (deputy director) said, "The major problem is due to the communication breakdown. If communication is restored it will help in co-ordination of rescue operations in a better way." Other institutions like Defence Institute of High Altitude Research (DIHAR), the ITBP camp, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and others have also been affected.1,314 people, mostly tourists, have been airlifted from Leh to Delhi. Three additional Indian Airlines flights from Jammu and Delhi have been planned. Three IL-76 and four AN-32 aircraft carried relief material to Leh this morning, and four more by Jet Airways and Air India and three by Kingfisher Airlines will carry relief material and doctors to Leh.The ITBP has sent water tankers containing drinking water to affected areas. Medical camps have been set up in villages like Saboo. The bodies of eleven persons were transported to Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Rajasthan this morning.India's crisis comes as Pakistan is experiencing the worst floods in the country's history.File:Thailand Phuket.pngThe flight data recorder from One-Two-GO Airlines Flight 269 was recovered today after the MD-82 jet crashed yesterday on landing during a storm at Phuket International Airport in Thailand. At least 89 people are confirmed to have been killed in the crash, as rescue crews continued to recover bodies from the wreckage.The cause of the crash was "probably weather related", Vutichai Singhamanee, director of the Civil Aviation Authority's flight standards bureau, was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. There was a strong wind and heavy rain at the time.Flying from Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok, the plane landed at Phuket at around 3:40 p.m. local time (0840 GMT), skidded off the runway, ran into some trees and an earth embankment, broke in two and burst into flames.The plane was carrying 130 people – 123 passengers, two pilots and five crew members. At least 79 of the people aboard were foreigners. Phuket is an island on the Andaman Sea, on the west coast of southern Thailand and is a popular destination for tourists. Survivors from Australia, Austria, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom were being treated at local hospitals, The Nation reported.The flight data recorder, or "black box", is to be sent to the United States for analysis. The US National Transportation Safety Board is assisting with the investigation in Thailand, which is routine for the NTSB because the crash involves a US-made aircraft.Phuket International Airport was closed for the remainder of yesterday and most of today while the recovery of the wreckage continued.The crash is the first major incident for Thailand's fledgling low-cost aviation sector, and the first fatal commercial aviation incident in Thailand since the crash of Thai Airways Flight 261 in 1998 in Surat Thani.Founded in 2003, One-Two-GO is the domestic, low-cost subsidiary of Orient Thai Airlines, a small Thailand-based carrier that does mostly charter flights with a fleet of older Boeing 747s. The MD-82 involved in yesterday's crash is thought to be at least 24 years old.An  Armavia Airbus 320 passenger plane flying from Armenia's capital, Yerevan, to the city of Sochi in southern Russia has crashed into the Black Sea. The jet was found 6 km from the coast and carried a total of 113 people. Among the passengers were 8 crew and 6 children. Controllers lost contact with the plane at 0215 local time (Tuesday 2215 UTC).Rescuers have found the corpses of a woman and a girl and another 12 body parts at the site of Wednesday's crash of Armenia's Airbus A-320 plane off Russia's Black Sea coast, a spokesman for the Russian Prosecutor General's Office told Interfax. Other reports say that at least 25 bodies have been found.There were 77 Armenian citizens, 26 Russian citizens, 1 Ukrainian and 1 Georgian citizen on board of the Armenian air liner, Armenian Civil Aviation Department head Artyom Movsisian told on a news conference."Most of the Russian citizens are of Armenian origin," Movsisian said. "Rescue efforts are being hampered by deteriorating weather conditions, heavy rain and rough seas," a spokesman for the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said. "The fragments were found six km (3.7 miles) from the shore near the airport of Adler. The search operation continues," said Beltsov. The location of the crash site has been ascertained by a numerous fragments and life vests, and a large oil slick."The only thing [we] know is that when the crew asked for permission to land, the air controller in Sochi responded that bad weather meant this was not yet possible," Gayane Davtyan, head of Armenia's civilian aviation authority said. "Contact with the crew was lost at 600 meters, when the plane went to circle for a second time."The cause of the tragedy remains unclear, but the investigators are pursuing two main versions: bad weather conditions and poor maintenance.The Russian Prosecutor General's Office believes terrorism can be ruled out as a factor in the A-320 plane crash near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Wednesday morning."We don't have any information that could indicate a possible terrorist attack on board the plane," Russian Deputy Prosecutor General Nikolai Shepel told Interfax on Wednesday. An official from the regional department of the Emergency Situations Ministry in southern Russia said "apparently there were malfunctions on board, as the pilots were making another attempt to land at the Adler airport.""The plane was in an ideal technical condition, the crew was well qualified," said the airline's deputy commercial director, Andrei Aghajanov. The cause of the crash is under investigation.In the area where the plane crashed, more rain is expected in the next hours and the water temperature is currently between 8 to 10 degrees celsius.The Russian and Armenian presidents have announced on Wednesday that Friday, May 5th, would be a day of mourning in remembrance of the 113 people that died in the crash. The worst crash involving an two-engine A-320, which was first built in 1984 and remains the most popular Airbus on the market, occurred in August 2000, when a Gulf Air plane crashed off Bahrain on a flight from Cairo, killing all 143 people on board. The Airbus A320 is a short-to-medium range commercial passenger aircraft and a total of 328 people have been killed in earlier A320 accidents.About 20 boats and a Be-200 amphibious aircraft are involved in the recovery operation, emergency services said, adding that two more Be-200s would fly to the scene if necessary. A group of rescuers from the Russian emergency ministry is expected to fly to the crash site in the next few hours.In November 2007, a twin-engine 30-year-old Piper aircraft lost all electrical power on board shortly after departing from Kerry airport in Ireland for a flight to Jersey. Without any electrical power, the pilot was unable to use his radio to contact air traffic control. He was briefly able to re-establish contact with the tower using his cell phone, but that was also disrupted.  The report into the incident published on August 6 revealed how a quick-thinking air traffic controller in Cork started sending directions to the pilot by text message. With this assistance, the plane, with five people on board, landed safely after the undercarriage was lowered manually and air traffic control visually confirmed that it was down. Prior to lowering the undercarriage, the first officer noticed that the nose wheel had failed to retract fully and was actually at half its travel."In this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the ATC controller, who, on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent, quickly switched to texting his instructions instead", said John Hughes, an air accident investigator who reported on the incident. "This contributed to the safe resolution of the incident and, for such, the controller should be commended for his actions."The pilot, aged 39 and with 1,900 hours of flying experience, succeeded in climbing to an altitude of 6,500 feet without any problems, but needed to communicate to ensure a safe landing. He originally attempted to contact Kerry airport, and after that failed he made attempts to contact Cork. The report found that the loss of electrical power was due to the aircraft's alternators failing to maintain the required voltage, probably due to the battery voltage being insufficient to excite the alternator's windings. The relay may have been in poor condition after having been subjected to a heavy load following take-off, possibly contributing to the incident.Officials from France's aviation accident investigation agency, the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), announced on Tuesday that they had recovered the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of Air France Flight 447. It was located and brought to the surface by a Remora 6000 unmanned submarine, then taken aboard the Île de Sein, one of the vessels taking part in the recovery and salvage efforts.This came two days after an announcement on Sunday that the crash-survivable memory unit of the flight data recorder (FDR) of the aircraft had been located and brought to the surface. The chassis of the FDR was located on April 27, with the memory unit missing. It was found a short distance from the chassis. It was also brought to the surface by the Remora 6000.With the recovery of both recorders, which are reported to be "in good condition", French officials hope to determine what caused the Airbus A330-200 to crash into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, when it departed Rio de Janeiro's Galeão International Airport before it was lost 600 miles (965 km) off the coast of Brazil en route to Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport with 228 passengers and crew on board.The leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's pitot tubes, devices which measure how fast the aircraft is traveling. Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash. The plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down.However, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, Phil Seymour, speaking to CNN, believes the memory unit will not be of much use to investigators saying because of the depth it was located at,  "If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split and you have the corrosive effects of seawater and the depths involved." Seymour believes the wreckage will help reveal what happened as more is recovered."It may be that the more wreckage they find will help them to piece it all together, which bit by bit could help them build a picture of what caused the plane to come down," he added.A BEA spokesperson had agreed with that possibility a few days earlier when speaking to the Associated Press about the recovery of the flight data recorder. "We can't say in advance that we're going to be able to read it until it's been opened," the spokesperson said. AsThe wreckage of the Airbus A330-200, was found back on April 8 at a depth of 3,800 and 4,000 meters (2,070 to 2,190 fathoms or 12,467 feet and 13,123 feet), by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, using a Remus robotic submarine and its side-scan sonar. After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage. The location of the recorders were localized within 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) of the flight's last position last year.In March, a French judge placed the European aircraft maker Airbus and Air France under investigation for possible involuntary manslaughter charges in the 2009 crash. Both are paying the cost of the search which is estimated to be $12.7 million (nine million euro). The crash is the deadliest in Air France's history.Floating wreckage has been retrieved from a Brazilian Cessna 310 that disapeared on Friday with two local pilots and four businessmen from the United Kingdom. The debris was recovered from a beach in the North-East of the country.The aircraft had been chartered by the businessmen from Aero Star to carry them as part of a trip to evaluate a potential luxury housing development. They have been identified as Nigel Hodges, 52, Alan Kempson, 46, Sean Woodhall, 43, and Ricky Every, 41. Nothing has been heard from them or their pilots since the plane lost radio contact on Friday evening and vanished.The beach where the debris was recovered is about 90 to 95 kilometres (55 to 60 miles) North of the aircraft's last known position. The items retrieved are said to be a piece of one of the seats and a fragment of the cargo stowage area.A naval boat, two C-95s from the air force and a helicopter are amongst the resources deployed to try and locate the aircraft and its missing occupants. One airforce spokeswoman said "Hopefully [they're alive], but we don't know." The property the men were planning is an "eco-development" proposed by Worldwide Destinations, which is presided by Woodhall, who is a resident of Switzerland. The company employs Every in Brazil, and Kempson and Hadges are from finance company Diamond Lifestyle Holdings. Kempson is reported to be a friend of former UK Prime Minister Sir John Major. Hodges' wife and son have flown to Brazil to be present during the rescue operation.In the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, floods have left 84 people dead and another 54,000 homeless. Heavy rainfall in recent days caused landslides that have blocked roads and destroyed homes in the region. Eight towns have been cut off by flood waters, and some 160,000 people were left without electricity. Emergency workers have been using boats and helicopters to try and reach those that have been stranded. Heavy rains have affected a large portion of southern Brazil, but Santa Catarina has seen the worst of the bad weather."Almost all the deaths were caused by landslides that left people buried in their own homes," said Luiz Henrique da Silveira, Santa Catarina's governor.The death toll was the highest in the town of Ilhota, located along the banks of the Itajai River. 15 people died there when waters rose 9 meters (30 feet) above normal levels. The nearby city of Blumenau also took a hard blow, where 13 people died after being buried by mudslides. Rain is still falling in Blumenau as of today, and meteorologists say that it is unlikely to stop until Wednesday.Seventeen highways were blocked by mudslides. According to officials, it could take several days to reopen several that were heaped high with earth and trees from hillsides as a result of them.Shortages of cooking gas and fuel for cars were caused as the result of a pipeline rupture, which cut off natural gas from the state's sole source located in Bolivia. Gas was also cut off to the neighbouring state of Rio Grande do Sul, which borders both Argentina and Uruguay.In total, about one and a half million people are said to have been affected by the flooding.The flood in northern Serbian province Vojvodina worsens as the river Tamiš rises further. The river flooded 10 days ago, covering the Јaša Tomić village. More then 200 houses were destroyed and around 800 are flooded, forcing 3235 people to evacuate. The flood was caused by heavy rain in Serbia and Romania. Meteorologists say that Tamiš level will get lower in the following days.Serbian army and volunteers are helping local residents, building a dike and saving the animals, but the villagers are short on drinking water and other supplies. There are no human casualties. The People's Office of the President of Serbia has started an aid drive to help Јaša Tomić.Interstate 80 is closed in Cedar County, Iowa, east of the Iowa City area, due to flooding from the Iowa River and Coralville Lake. The flooding that has devastated cities in eastern Iowa has travelled downstream and is now threatening Iowa City and Coralville, both of which have issued evacuations for low-lying areas. Flooding on the Cedar River earlier filled Waterloo, Cedar Falls, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with record-breaking water levels. Interstate 80 is closed between mile markers 266 and 267, with a 281-mile long detour to get around it: Eastbound through traffic must leave I-80 at Des Moines and travel north along Interstate 35 then east to Dubuque via U.S. Route 20, where it can move south along U.S. Route 61 to return to Interstate 80 at the Quad Cities, with westbound through traffic following the opposite route. Local traffic is being allowed, since this shuts off a 150-mile stretch of highway.Interstate 380 has also been closed, between mile markers 4 and 10, due to flooding from the Iowa River and Lake Coralville. This, combined with the flooding of the bridges across the Cedar River at Cedar Rapids, effectively cuts Cedar Rapids off from Iowa City; the only way between the two cities, normally 30 miles apart, is a 281-mile long detour that takes drivers through Des Moines.The Cedar River at Cedar Rapids crested today at a record-breaking 31.1 feet, nearly 20 feet above flood stage. The Iowa River is expected to crest at Iowa City at 33 feet, 11 feet over flood stage and 4.5 feet over the record, on the morning of June 17.The Danube River, running from Germany to the Black Sea in Romania, is currently at 859 cm (28 ft 2 in) higher than its normal level in Budapest, Hungary.  Climatologists are predicting that the river will crest as high as 865 cm (28' 5").  This places the crest higher than in 2002, when floods swept across all Europe.  The Danube crested at 860 cm (28' 3") high then. According to officials, 11,000 buildings are in danger of flood damage, and 172 hectares (475 acres) of land are currently under water.  Officials also placed the country under a Level 3 Alert (on a 3 level scale).Margit Island is completely under water, with 3500 sandbags giving it protection. The riverside is no less under water, and the underground number 2 (M2) is currently in danger of being closed since one of its stations, Battyány tér, is flooded.  According to Hungarian Water engineers, a flood of this magnitude hasn't occurred since 1838 when ice coming down the river blocked the Danube, creating a natural dam which caused the water to flood everything behind it.General elections are on Sunday in Hungary.  The election is heated with MSZP and FIDESZ in a virtual dead heat with polls rating both at 45%.  Other smaller parties are voicing concern about gaining a 5% toe-hold to gain a seat in Parliament.  It is not yet clear how the flood will impact the final campaign.Torrential rains pounded Honolulu and the eastern part of the island of Oahu on Friday during the midday, causing flooding along streams and major highways and closing a major shopping mall.Between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. HST (2030 to 2300 UTC), rain fell at the rate of about one to two inches (2.5 to 5.0 cm) an hour in Honolulu and up to three inches (7.5 cm) an hour in Waimanalo on the southeast coast.Makiki Stream overflowed its banks at several points along its route, especially in the Pawaa district where homes and businesses near Kalakaua Avenue were inundated by up to a foot of water.  Several houses in Manoa were also reported flooded as Manoa Stream overtopped its banks.Kahala Mall, a major shopping mall in the upscale district of Kahala, was closed due to flooding that left 80% of the stores under as much as a foot and a half of water.  According to eyewitness reports, the flooding started when rushing water breached a wall in the mall's movie theatres.  The mall remains closed today and tomorrow while officials assess damage and clean up.The rainstorm capped one and a half months of heavy rain and thunderstorms in the state of Hawaii, and arguably its rainiest March in recent memory.Moderate flooding has hit the province of Nakhon Sri Thammarat in southern Thailand. Moderate to heavy rain persists in the area, further exacerbating the flooding conditions. The northeast monsoon has intensified the flow of rainfall-laden air from the Gulf of Thailand.  Torrential rains have been plaguing the nine southernmost provinces of the country for nearly two weeks and further downpours are forecast for later this week.Thung Song District in Nakhon Sri Thammarat province is experiencing waist-high floodwaters in downtown shopping areas. Transportation has ground to a halt in affected areas.  In Songkhla Province, the government has called for steps to be taken to prevent further flooding of the commerial district of Hat Yai.  Rail tracks have been lifted in some areas to permit flood waters to leave the city, and the Thai Navy has been ordered to take part in relief efforts.In Muang District of Nakhon Sri Thammarat, many roads have been closed and sandbags are being deployed to help affected businesses. Schools throughout the province have been closed because of flooding conditions.  Other provinces, including Phattalung, Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, Trang, Sukhothai and Satun have experienced similar problems with high tides and heavy rain paralysing much of the region.The Meteorological Department of the Thailand Ministry of Information and Communication Technology issued a weather advisory concerning the flooding, "People in the lower South and navigators in the Gulf of Thailand should exercise caution and small boats should stay from December 15 until December 18."  It is reported that this has left some tourists stranded on smaller resort islands in the Gulf of Thailand.Across the border in Malaysia, three are reported to have died and over 10,000 been evacuated as a result of the flooding.There has been flooding in and around Adelaide in the state of South Australia today. Some areas have received 100mm of rain in less than 24 hours. In some suburbs phone and mobile services seem to be having a lack of connectivity. Around 60 houses have been damaged due to the flooding and some metropolitan roads have been closed off and motorists have also been advised to adviod these areas. Flood waters also submerged Christmas decorations along the Torrens River put out by the South Australian Brewing company. The Christmas decorations were on display as of the coming Christmas pageant. Local residents report that the light from Christmas decorations were again visible around 7:00pm.Sandbags have been supplied to the worst areas and some relief for flood water victims has already been suggested. The rain has also filled Adelaide's water reservoirs to capacity and caused them to overflow, as stated by water authorities.Houses have also been evacuated near the banks of the Gawler River, and many other residents have been advised by the South Australian State Emergency Service to leave their homes earlier rather than later.Flooding due to heavy rains has devastated North Korea (DPRK), leaving over 100 dead and thousands homeless. The United Nations' official figures give the death toll at 154, with 127 more missing. North Korean officials have said that hundreds have been killed.However, The South Korean aid organisation Good Friends estimates that around 10,000 are dead or missing, with 1.5 million people homeless. While these figures have not been confirmed, the group's information has been found accurate in the past. In response, the Red Cross of South Korea has offered aid which was turned down by Pyongyang, whose North Korean counterpart responded with "thanks for Seoul's offer" but said "it will handle the recovery efforts from recent floods by itself." North Korea has also refused other international offers of help, including from the World Food Programme.The Red Cross has reported that over 7,000 homes were completely destroyed, with almost 13,000 families left homeless. Flooding has also affected almost a quarter of a million acres of farmland, further exacerbating food shortages. North Korea earlier refused a South Korean food aid package conditioned on a return to talks over North Korea's nuclear programme. Later, following DPRK's missile tests, South Korea had announced a suspension of the aid programme. Private groups in South Korea have announced plans to send aid shipments, which are expected to be accepted by DPRK.The powerful storm system that flooded parts of the Midwest and the Plains moved through Ohio today. Six people were killed in Oklahoma, eight were killed in Texas, and one person was killed in Missouri due to the storms.The flooding was a result of a powerful storm system combined with the remnants of Tropical Storm Erin.Some parts of the U.S. saw eleven inches of rain in the matter of a few hours on Monday. The storms moved into Ohio on Tuesday, flooding a seven-mile (11 km) stretch of Interstate 75 in northwestern Ohio.Sheriff's Lt. Neil Riedlinger said, water was over 3 feet (1 m) deep in some areas of downtown Carey, Ohio, and a local nursing home had to be evacuated. Firefighters had to use boats to rescue numerous people.And, about 200 people were evacuated in the Akron, Ohio area due to severe flooding.Southwestern Wisconsin was under another flash flood watch Tuesday night and Wednesday, with a chance of rain through Friday.On Monday, the heavy rain flooded street, streams, and a sewage treatment plant in Iowa.Wind gusts of up to 82 mph (132 km/h) and golf-ball sized hail were reported in Nebraska from these storms.In Minnesota, a dive team and a National Guard helicopter were called in to search for Jered Lorenz, 37, whose car was found overturned lodged in between rocks along a creek. Numerous mud slides were reported all across Minnesota, an area believed to be among the hardest hit areas according to meteorologists. Ben Tracy of WCCO-TV in Rushford, Minnesota reported, "It's the worst flooding anyone here has seen in 30 years." Orange X's in the area mark buildings that have already been searched for survivors.Torrential rains and floods in the North West and Gauteng provinces of South Africa have caused disruption, government bodies said earlier today.The Greater Taung Local Municipality said a disaster area was declared, after 150 homes were affected and one person was confirmed dead from flooding.Residents were warned to keep away from bridges and rivers, and to drive carefully in the inclement weather. Water Affairs spokesperson Mava Scott commented that "people in the low lying areas should be alerted."The Vaal Dam, meanwhile, was at 105% full, after six sluice gates were opened. Three more are expected to be opened soon, according to the South African Press Association. The Bloemhof Dam in North West province is 112% full, with flood gates having been opened there earlier today.Officials encouraged people to remove their boats and pumps, as water flow would not be predictable. "It will also be rather dangerous for people to go too near to the river's embankments during this time," Superintendent Eugene Opperman noted.Meanwhile, roads to places such as Manokwane, Lokaleng, Khibitswane, Mokgareng, and Pudimoe, were also inundated with water. 800 mine workers from East Rand Mines were evacuated as well.Floods have affected over a million people in the Mexican State of Tabasco, mainly in the capital of the state, Villahermosa. This has escalated in the last days into becoming the state's worst catastrophe in its history.Eighty percent of the state's territory is underwater due to the Grijalva river flooding and heavy rains, which are expected to continue over the next few days.Mexican president Felipe Calderón defined the situation as critical and urged all Mexicans to give their support.Helicopters and boats are being used to move people from rooftops and hospital patients are being flown to neighbouring states.Industry has also been affected as mentioned by Tabasco governor Andres Granier, who said that 100% of the tabasco pepper crops had been lost.He also compared the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina on the US Gulf Coast two years ago, saying that New Orleans was "small compared to this".American preservationists breathed a sigh of relief in August as the Farnsworth House, a Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed house widely considered a masterpiece of modern architecture, was spared by flooding along the Fox River in Plano.Storms deluged much of the Midwest, causing rivers throughout the region to overflow their banks. At the Fox River in Plano flood waters spilled over four acres of the 58-acre Farnsworth House site. Waters continued to rise through August 24, until they were just 18 inches from the front door.According to the reporting of the Chicago Tribune preservationists developed a disaster management plan on the spot. Staff used boats to access the house and once inside raised the vulnerable furnishings to higher levels atop crates.Flooding along the Fox River in 1996 caused a large plate glass window in the steel and glass home to break, resulting in $250,000 damage and preservationists feared a repeat of that incident."We really lucked out and can look at this as a drill," Barbara Campagna, architect for National National Trust for Historic Preservation, told Preservation Online.The Farnsworth House was completed in 1951 and designed by internationally famous architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for Chicago doctor Edith Farnsworth. The house is a National Historic Landmark and a nationally significant example of modern architecture. As one of the most famous examples of such architecture, the Farnsworth House was unprecedented at the time of its completion.In the United States, the Cedar River continues to break records today as it floods Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The river is approaching its expected crest of over 30 feet, over 18 feet over flood stage and more than ten feet over the previous record high. The downtown area is underwater, as well as several residential neighborhoods against the river. All road bridges over the river in the area except for the Interstate 380 bridge are closed and covered with water, and one of the two railroad bridges has swept away. For a short time, the Linn County Sheriff's Department had closed I-380 to allow emergency services to use it, but later re-opened it, allowing traffic in the rightmost lane.The river is expected to crest around 7:00 a.m. Friday morning (June 13).Florida braces for the arrival of Hurricane Dennis as governor Jeb Bush announced a state of emergency on a televised press conference Friday afternoon at 2:00 EST.  Dennis weakened slightly after making landfall in Cuba and now packs sustained winds of 145 miles per hour. Thousands have fled the Florida Keys under a mandatory evacuation order where the storm is expected to strike sometime this evening.The storm wobbled slightly after arriving in Cuba where it claimed up to three lives. Ham radio operators reported that most power lines are down in the province of Cienfuegos, where a major seaport is located on Cuba's southern coast. According to Reuters, 18 lives were claimed by the storm in Haiti yesterday when it passed over that island nation.The storm is expected to continue on a north-westerly path that will brush the southern tip of Florida and head up the state's Gulf of Mexico coastline, where warm gulf waters could fuel the storm and raise it to a Category 5 storm.Speculation has begun on the possibility of higher gas prices as gulf oil refineries are threatened.Hurricane Dennis comes quickly on the heels of 3-day ago Tropical Storm Cindy, in what is noted as record storm activity for this early in the hurricane season.A road accident followed by a fire on a Florida highway near Gainesville on Thursday killed five children in a church bus and two truck drivers. One semi truck and a car broke through the center guardrail before colliding with other vehicles; around 50 gallons of diesel fuel, officials said, spilled and ignited.The children were all from Marksville, Louisiana. The Avoyelles House of Mercy, a Pentecostal church, had been travelling 700 miles from Louisiana to Walt Disney World and was within an hour of its destination. One truck driver was from West Palm Beach, Florida, the other from Albuquerque, New Mexico. The deceased were aged nine, ten, thirteen, two aged fourteen, 49, and 59. At least eight more people were hospitalized.The accident sequence began, Florida Highway Patrol described, in the northbound lanes of Interstate 75 close to Alachua when the initial collision between the car and truck occurred. After crossing the center divider, the out-of-control vehicles collided with the church bus and a second semi truck in the southbound lanes. The bus overturned, with occupants ejected; a southbound fifth vehicle was unable to prevent itself running through the debris. Reports indicate this vehicle may have struck victims lying on the roadway.According to eyewitness Vinnie DeVita, "within probably 15 to 20 seconds of it all, it exploded. I mean, just a ball of flames." DeVita narrowly avoided being caught up in the accident. The Alachua Sheriff's Office tweeted the response "required all hands on deck." Authorities stated the road was damaged by the fire's ferocity. Emergency workers have indicated a homicide probe is ongoing.Another eyewitness, Nicole Towarek, described extensive tire marks and "insane" heat. Florida Department of Transportation official Troy Roberts said yesterday morning the road itself, which is straight in the vicinity, will be examined as part of investigations. He said "Guardrails can only take so much." The guardrail would be examined, Roberts said, to determine if it had performed as designed. The state had lanes closed last night as it worked to repair the damaged surface.Also investigating is the Florida Highway Patrol, which is attempting to ascertain who, if anyone, is to blame. Meanwhile the National Transportation Safety Board, commonly involved in major highway accident probes, was absent. It is presently unable to operate due to a shutdown of much of the Federal government in a budget dispute; however, its website notes that its operations center is still accepting accident notifications without specifying if this resource is operating 24/7 as it usually does.Hurricane Rita prompted local Florida Keys officials to evacuate the area.  Evacuation ended as remaining people sought shelter. The storm is threatening to cause a 16+ foot storm surge, and has become a Category 5 hurricane.[1]The storm may hit Southern Florida, then the US Gulf Coast; preliminary maps suggest landfall in Texas. Fear has caused crude oil prices to rise by $4 per barrel on Monday, in anticipation that Rita would cause more damage to the oil refineries around the Gulf of Mexico. This was the largest single day price increase for crude oil in history. Prices dropped by $1 to $66 per barrel on Tuesday, eased partly by news that OPEC would supply 2 million barrels of oil per day in extra capacity to ease supply shortages.Phil Flynn, an analyst, stated that "We really can't afford to lose more production," as Katrina left many oil facilities inoperable.40,000 residents are affected by the evacuation plans, which include everyone in the southern portions of the Keys. Voluntary evacuations were issued to 134,000 coastal residents. Five Cuban provinces were set on alert, as well as certain areas in the Bahamas and the remainder of Florida.Rita could affect New Orleans and other places recovering from Hurricane Katrina — it may cause a great deal of water to be dumped on the region — worrying officials. Daniel Brown, a hurricane meteorologist, said "This is something everyone should be paying attention to." President Bush adds: "There is deep concern about this storm causing more flooding in New Orleans."From a Sunday, September 11 broadcast of MSNBC's Meet The Press, Mr. Russert received the following answer to a question about the vulnerability of New Orleans to flooding. Dr. Ivor van Heerden is the deputy director of Louisiana State University Hurricane Center:MR. RUSSERT: ...Doctor, you're an expert on this. We're still in the hurricane season. What are the chances, the likelihood that a tropical storm or, God forbid, another hurricane could hit this same area?DR. VAN HEERDEN: You know, there is a high probability it could happen. The unfortunate thing is, because the levee system is so weakened, just a tropical storm could reflood New Orleans. So it's a very, very vulnerable situation right now. We don't need another Katrina to flood New Orleans. A tropical storm that puts maybe five feet or six feet of water in Lake Pontchartrain, which is not rare, would reflood the city.MR. RUSSERT: Do you think the local, state and federal governments are prepared for an event like that in the coming weeks?DR. VAN HEERDEN: I don't think so, because right now they're really battling just to try and shore up the levees. You know, there were seven major levee breaks and it's going to take quite a lot of time to repair those, to have them engineeringly sound so they won't give way again.The hurricane season is in full swing, ending on November 30.A Flydubai passenger jet has crashed in Russia, killing everyone aboard, 62 people including a crew of seven. The aircraft was making its second attempt to land early yesterday morning in Rostov-on-Don, a city in southern Russia, when it crashed.Flydubai confirmed the crash on landing of flight FZ981. Four passengers were children. "We are doing all we can to gather information as quickly as possible. At this moment our thoughts and prayers are with our passengers and our crew who were on board the aircraft," the airline said in a statement.The flight was scheduled to land at 1:20 a.m. local time, according to Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov, however went down at about 3:40 a.m. Investigations are ongoing. CEO of Flydubai Ghaith al-Ghaith said, "We will have information about the circumstances of the incident and the black box in the future, and an investigation is being conducted in cooperation with the Russian authorities and we are waiting to see the results".Budget airline FlyDubai has been flying since 2009, based in the United Arab Emirates. This is the first crash in the airline's history.Mr. Ghaith said the pilot and co-pilot each had more than 5,000 hours' flight experience. Russian officials said the international crew was made up of one Russian, one Cypriot, two Spaniards, a Colombian, and one each from Seychelles and Kyrgyzstan.Security footage from a camera pointed in the direction of the airport shows the blast as the plane crash-landed.Sealed Air Corporation, a packaging company based in Elmwood Park, New Jersey has agreed to settle legal action over the Station nightclub fire on Rhode Island in February 2003. The disaster killed 100 people with more than twice as many injured and this settlement is one of a series over the blaze.The fire was triggered by pyrotechnics in use by hard rock band Great White who were performing at the West Warwick venue at the time. They ignited flammable soundproofing foam on the walls.The latest settlement brings the total amount of settlements to $148.815 million, although all of these settlements are still tentative and subject to approval by families and a judge. Other companies that have already settled include Clear Channel Broadcasting, whose rock radio station was the show's promoter, Anheuser-Busch Inc., The Home Depot Inc., a pyrotechnics manufacturer and several other foam companies.Others still defending in the case, which names dozens of groups and individuals, include Rhode Island state, the fire inspector that did not enforce regulations at the club, and American Foam Corporation, who sold more foam to the Derderian brothers. The Derderians bought the club in 2000, whereas the foam allegedly manufactured by Sealed Air was installed in 1996. Sealed Air deny any wrongdoing, saying it was never proven that they indeed manufactured the foam and that the foam was being misused as soundproofing in any event.Regardless of the origin of the foam, it was argued that it burned too easily and produced toxic fumes when it did.The criminal case around the fire was resolved in 2006, with the Derderians and Great White tour manager Daniel Biechele - who ignited the pyrotechnics - charged with involuntary manslaughter. The Derderians pleaded no contest and Biechele pleaded guilty.Biechele was released on parole and Michael Derderian is due for parole next year. His brother was sentenced only to probation and community service.Sealed Air's insurance will pay the settlement.The Football Association (FA) charged English Premier League side Chelsea on Tuesday for "failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion" in the league game against QPR on Sunday, October 23.The match, which Chelsea lost 1–0, saw both defender José Bosingwa and striker Didier Drogba receive straight red cards for reckless challenges before half-time. Seven other players were cautioned through the course of the game. The charge relates to the players' reaction to the decision to send off Bosingwa.The FA have also requested to approach Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas regarding criticisms made of referee Chris Foy in post-match media interviews; if found guilty he faces a touchline ban or personal fine. Villas-Boas said Foy's decisions were "very poor" and that he felt these influenced the result of the game.Speaking to the BBC, he expressed no remorse for his words: "Of course the FA want to speak to me regarding things I said after the game, but I will reiterate once again that the same criteria was not applied for both teams. [...] If you take one rule you have to stick to it for the rest of the game to show that you have a pattern in what you are doing, and I have full evidence now that wasn't the case. It is a game refereed by humans and human mistakes were present."After the same game, Chelsea captain John Terry was accused of racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand after videos of the two arguing circulated on sharing site YouTube in which Terry appears to use slurs. The incident is being investigated by both QPR themselves and the Metropolitan Police.After facing criticism for being slow to act and initially giving too little after the December 26 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the United States government was quick to act when a massive earthquake hit Indonesia again March 28. U.S. State Department Adam Ereli said under orders of President George W. Bush, American embassy officials have been in contact with both Indonesia officials and the International Red Cross to coordinate international relief efforts and other foreign aid.The two former U.S. presidents, Bill Clinton and the current president's father, George H.W. Bush, already are heading up U.S. aid efforts in the region as the result of the last major temblor. "We still have people over there assisting from the first one, and they will be our first line of defense, once we know what kind of damage there is," Pat McCrummen, spokesman for the American Red Cross told the Associated Press.Although relief officials have been in contact with various governments, no specific pledge amount has been announced (as of 20:51, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)).A large forest fire in Kassandra on the Chalkidiki peninsula, close to Greece's second biggest city, Thessalonika, in Central Macedonia region, has resulted in one dead German tourist and injury to hundreds of locals and other tourists.  The fire, which broke out Monday afternoon, had a front of some 20km in length as it burned through pine forest in Polychrono, Hanioti, Pefkohori and Kryopigi.  Approximately 4,000 hectares (8,500 acres) of forest have been destroyed along with about 20 buildings.The Hellenic Ministry of Mercantile Marine had sent five coastguard ships to the coasts of Kassandra to help tourists evacuate the beaches - sending them to the opposite coasts of  Sithonia to escape the fires. According to the British Foreign Office and UK tourist operators, more than 1,500 British tourists were in the area of Chalkidiki when the fire started. Local authorities report that a German tourist was found dead during his efforts to save his family in the coast. According to AFP reports, in the western point of the peninsula more than 260 firemen, along with troops of the Greek army and volunteers, are struggling to extinguish the fires that continue to burn. Referring to the fire on the Chalkidiki peninsula, PASOK president George Papandreou criticised the Greek government for what he called its inability to coordinate and promptly address the problem. The response from the Greek government to the major fire that broke out in northern Greece was not at all slow, the governmental spokesman told media on Tuesday. However, the fire in Kassandra, Chalkidiki has provoked criticism from most of the Greek media against the government, which is blamed for not being ready to tackle such a situation. MPs of the opposition announced to the media that they are ready to officially question the ability of the government to prevent such disasters in popular tourist destinations of Greece like Chalkidiki.In southern Greece today, huge forest fires continue to burn on destroying homes and causing severe damage to the region. Local fire departments put the current death toll at at least 37, nine of which were children.Since Friday morning, around 170 fires have been burning, many of which are believed to be caused by arson. Authorities are calling the fires "criminal acts." Fire department spokesman Nikos Diamandis said most of the fires were started in entirely different areas, and were started after dark. Some fires reportedly broke out in "lush greenery."27 deaths have been confirmed in Peloponnese, one of the hardest hit areas. Today, however, fires broke out near Athens.Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was to for an emergency meeting of the senior ministers in the country's capital, Athens. Karamanlis said, "This is a day of national mourning...I wish to express my deep grief over the lost lives...We are fighting against heavy odds, on many fronts and under particularly tough conditions."Greece's government yesterday asked its European Union allies for help. About 30 countries are offering support, according to an EU statement.New fires were reportedly still breaking out this morning.Some helicopters and airplanes, which were to drop water on the fires, continued to be delayed by strong winds.Several forest fires which have ruined well over ten thousand hectares of land are continuing to burn in the Spanish region of Galicia today.Four people have perished so far in the blazes which the government says were started intentionally by arsonists over a week ago. Police have arrested twenty-four people on suspicion of starting the fires. Among those being detained is a ninety-four year-old man."Those arrested are people who knew exactly what they were doing, knew they were committing crimes and went up into the hills to start fires, sometimes more than one," said the president of Galicia’s regional government, Emilio Perez Tourino.Four hundred troops are currently in the northwestern county guarding densely-populated areas, airports and power stations. Spain’s President of Government, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, said earlier this week that an additional 1,200 army personnel would be sent to the area to assist the fire service.Yesterday, flames continued to threaten Galicia, but the number of fires said to be out of control reportedly dropped thanks to the vigorous efforts of firefighters, soldiers and volunteers. Alfredo Canal, a Galician rural agency chief, told Reuters yesterday: "We have a situation that is noticeably better than in recent days."The former premier of the Canadian province of Alberta, Jim Prentice, was killed on Thursday night along with three other people after the plane they were traveling in crashed shortly after takeoff near Kelowna, British Columbia, en route to Calgary, Alberta.The plane, a Cessna Citation, departed Kelowna at 9:32 p.m. before quickly disappearing from radar sight, according to a Transportation Safety Board official, Bill Yearwood. The National Post reported RCMP detachments in Kelowna and Lake Country were alerted to the loss of contact at 10:07 p.m. by Surrey Air Traffic Control Centre. According to tracking site FlightAware, the plane's last recorded data point showed it descending from an altitude of 4,800 feet at 2,200 feet per minute. The plane crashed 18 km (11 miles) north of Kelowna in a wooded are, where its wreckage was subsequently found by search crews. Local residents noted it was raining at the time, though without heavy storms.On the accident, Bill Yearwood stated to CTV News, "It was during climb out from Kelowna that something went wrong obviously to cause the aircraft to descend and collide with terrain."Officials and family identified the other passengers on the plane as optometrist Ken Gellatly, father-in-law to one of Prentice's daughters, and businessman Sheldon Dunphy Reid, who owned stock in the plane's operator Norjet. Both men were from Calgary. The plane's pilot was Jim Kruk, a friend of Prentice.The Prentice family stated, "Words cannot begin to express our profound shock and heartbreak at the news that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, Jim, has died in this tragic event".  The statement also mentioned Gellatly, "also a very special man."  They noted, "To lose two family members at once is unbelievably painful and we are certain you will appreciate and respect our wishes for privacy at this time and the coming weeks".Prentice, 60, led Alberta as premier and leader of the Progressive Conservative Party from September 2014 to May 2015, until his government was toppled in a provincial election. Before ascending to the position, he served under the federal Conservative Party as a cabinet minister, first for Indian and Northern Affairs, then Industry, and finally the Environment. As news broke of his death, the country's political leaders issued tributes to Prentice.In a press conference in Lethbridge, Alberta, Justin Trudeau, the country's Prime Minister, described Prentice as "a strong voice for the people of Alberta and for the people of Canada", adding Prentice's work used an "intelligent, honest and straightforward approach".  "I greatly enjoyed my interactions with Jim, time I spent working beside him, across from him in the House. And while we didn't always share the same views, he was always incredibly kind and respectful to me, and I will miss him profoundly".Stephen Harper, Trudeau's predecessor, under whose administration Prentice served, issued a statement on Twitter, "Laureen [Harper's wife] and I were shocked and saddened to learn of the death of our friend and colleague Jim Prentice [...] Jim was a family man, friend, leader, and most importantly, a proud Canadian. His legacy will live on through his loving family and decades of public service."Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party of Canada, highlighted Prentice's term of office as environment minister and his "genuine concern" for environmental protection: "My heart goes out to Jim's wife, Karen, three daughters and grandchildren as they mourn this tragic loss", saying the news of Prentice's death left her "heartbroken".Tom Mulcair, leader of the federal NDP Party, noted that Prentice's service to his country and province was carried out with "honour and respect".  "He possessed a love for politics and deep sense of public service that was universally admired. [...] Today we all mourn this tragic loss.""He was deeply loved Alberta," said Prentice's successor Rachel Notley, who defeated Prentice in the previous election, following which Prentice resigned as leader of the Progressive Conservative party and as a member of Alberta's Legislative Assembly. "I benefited from his advice".  "For Alberta, today is a day of sorrow in the face of terrible tragedy." Notley's father died in a plane crash.Prentice's death came months after another former Canadian cabinet minister died in a plane crash, Jean Lapierre. Lapierre, of the federal Liberal Party, died after his plane crashed on March 29 in Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec.Wim Duisenberg, the former head of the European Central Bank, has been found dead in his swimming pool at his house in south-east France, the French police say. No details were given about the cause of 70-year-old Mr Duisenberg's death. However this was disputed by his wife, Gretta Duisenberg. She says she found her husband just outside the study in their villa and not in their swimming pool. The former Dutch finance minister was the ECB's first president, and oversaw the introduction of the single European currency, the euro.Former Irish politician Liam Lawlor died Saturday in a car crash outside Moscow, Russia. Lawlor's Mercedes crashed into a lamp post at approximately 1:00 AM MSKS (Friday, 2100 UTC).Lawlor was on a trip in the Russian capital and was making his way to the airport with his driver and a Ukrainian interpreter. The woman, who sustained serious injuries, survived the crash. The driver of the automobile was also killed.Lawlor resigned from poltics and his position as a Teachta Dála in the Irish house of parliament (the Dáil) after he admitted receiving sums of money from the lobbyist Frank Dunlop.  After Fianna Fáil conducted its own internal investigation, Lawlor resigned from the Party, however he continued to support the government in the Dáil. Lawlor appeared at the Tribunal on several occasions and was imprisoned in Mountjoy Prison for non-compliance with the investigation.Previous untrue allegations that the Ukrainian woman was a call girl have led to the Irish Independent newspaper issuing a formal apology to Mr Lawlor's Family.  Reports that Lawlor was in possession of the drug PCP were likewise proved to be false.Ena Kadić, an Austrian woman who won the 2013 Miss Austria crown, died early this week in hospital. She was 26 and fell whilst jogging in the Austrian Alps on Friday.Kadić fell roughly 30m down the Bergisel mountain in Tyrol, near Innsbruck where she worked. She was taken to Innsbruck University Hospital with injuries to her head, pelvis, and lung. Remaining conscious after the fall, she had alerted her family via telephone who in turn contacted emergency services.She was found near the Drachenfelsen platform, which overlooks the River Sill. Police said she knew the area and enjoyed running; a profile on the Miss Austria website said she was into sports and nature.The brown-haired, green-eyed beauty's looks took her to compete in Bali, Indonesia in 2013. Thereafter she shunned publicity and worked in a fashion store. "The media, the events, the parties — that life made me so unhappy," she said this year in a Seitenblicke interview.Former US Senator Ted Stevens, 86, and former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe, 54, were on an airplane that crashed in southwest Alaska, the Associated Press reports. A family spokesperson later confirmed that Stevens died in the crash, following earlier conflicting reports about his status. Both O'Keefe and his teenage son survived, according to a former NASA spokesperson.In addition to the former Senator and former NASA chief, there were seven other passengers, The New York Times reports. Of those, five were reported to have died. The plane was heading to a fishing lodge near Lake Aleknagik when it crashed. Senator Stevens' body has been recovered.The Alaska National Guard was called in at 7:00 p.m. AKDT (0300 UTC) Monday, and arrived at the crash site about 7:30 a.m. AKDT (1530 UTC) Tuesday. Severe weather has made finding the crash site difficult for rescue personnel. The National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, said it was sending a team of investigators to the crash site, which is unusual for crashes of private aircraft.As of 10:00 a.m. AKDT (1800 UTC), three of the survivors have been airlifted from the site by the United States Coast Guard.Ted Stevens was born on November 18, 1923 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He began serving as a US Senator for Alaska in 1968, and held the postition until 2009, when he was defeated in a reelection bid by Mark Begich. He was also facing corruption charges at the time, which were later dropped after an initial conviction when it was found that prosecutors had withheld evidence from Stevens' defense attorneys. In 1978, Stevens survived a plane crash in Anchorage, although the incident claimed the life of his first wife, Ann.Sean O'Keefe was nominated as a NASA administrator in 2001 by then-president George W. Bush, and led the space organization through shaky times, such as the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. He resigned in 2005 to become the chancellor of Louisiana State University.About 140 mostly weak or ailing victims of the hurricane ravaged city of New Orleans were flown here Saturday by a volunteer crew on a flight chartered by former United States Vice President Albert Gore.The victims were greeted by Knoxville's mayor, many medical professionals, and other volunteers helping them board buses destined to area hospitals.  There they were to be assessed and sent to a local Red Cross shelter.Although Gore was present on the flight and assisted moving the passengers to the waiting buses, he "declined to take credit for the airlift, fearing it would be 'politicized.'"[1]  An associate of Gore who assisted in the project, Dr. Anderson Spickard, said that although Gore chartered the flight, "we'll decide who pays for it later."Spickard also remarked that originally the plane was to take two flights that day, but flight delays forestalled that plan.  The plane will leave Knoxville Saturday evening, he said, to make another aid flight on Sunday.Four civilians driving southwest of Kabul were killed after a landmine exploded underneath their car. The head of criminal investigation in the Kabul police force, Ali Shah Paktiawal issued the following statement on the matter: "It was an old landmine that exploded in the Char Asiab District this morning and killed four people. It was not a roadside bomb or a recently planted mine."There are over 100,000 unexploded landmines in Afghanistan, planted in recent and older conflicts by the Soviet military and the Taliban. An average of sixty people a month are killed by mines.Fire destroyed a building that hosted the Five Spot night club in Philadelphia’s historic Old City section. No one was injured in the blaze,Firefighters battled for two hours to control the flames and people were evacuated from nearly buildings. Reports indicate that at least one wall inside the group of buildings that make the Five Spot collapsed, causing major structural damage. The fire was contained to three buildings, authorities say.The Five Spot brought an eclectic mix to Philadelphia’s Old City section where the business had thrived for 11 years. During an interview the owner said, "It was just time. We were looking to sell ... to somebody who would carry on the tradition." Lovett Hines, a longtime guru of the Philadelphia Jazz music scene said the club was a creative caldron of sorts for the neo-jazz genre. Cohen of Gloucester City said, “It was heart-wrenching; A lot of us were in tears.”Bushfires are burning across Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania assisted by very hot conditions.Victoria is the hardest hit with a single blaze burning out over 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) and destroying 20 homes.There are around a dozen fires burning in Victoria, with others in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania.Police are investigating whether or not two people found dead in their car near Moyston in South-West Victoria died as a result of the fire or died when their vehicle struck a tree.Firefighters in the south of New South Wales have been placed on high alert as the hot weather moves North.Firefighters across the affected states are hoping to take advantage of a cool change expected today. Earlier this month bushfires damaged property in New South Wales and Victoria.The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has tightened the deadline imposed earlier for inspection of all Boeing 737 Next Generation worldwide.The mandatory inspections were imposed after it was discovered that the China Airlines 737 that exploded in Japan had a hole in it's right wing fuel tank, which had been caused by a loose bolt from the wing slat assembly.The wing slats are panels mounted to the leading edge of a wing. They are moved forward during final approach for landing to increase lift from the wing, allowing the plane to fly slower than it can when the aircraft is configured for cruise without entering a stall. The bolt in question is mounted to the main slat tracks, on which the slats slide back and forth. As they are extended for landing, they can cause the bolt to be pushed through the adjacent wing fuel tank, rupturing it in the way it is believed the China Airlines plane's tank was.Thus far, the inspections have discovered four airliners in which the bolt was loose. These discoveries give the authorities cause to believe that loose wing slat track bolts may be more widespread than originally considered, and accordingly reduced the inspection deadline from 24 days to 10 days. After that, inspections must be made every 3,000 operational hours, an unchanged schedule from the original set out at the same time as the 24-day deadline.The Emergency Airworthiness Directive that the inspections are laid out in is believed to affect a total of 2,287 aircraft sold by Boeing around the world, although the FAA only has the authority to make the inspections compulsory for the 783 aircraft currently being operated in the U.S.Although the FAA refused to release any details on which aircraft were found to have loose bolts, CNN and Agence France-Presse both reported that a fifth plane also exhibited the fault, belonging to Air Nippon and in operation in Japan. Although the fault was located elsewhere in the assembly, it is believed to have an identically high chance of causing a rupture to the fuel tank. All 22 other 737 NextGens in Japan have been checked, with no problems being identified.Meanwhile, Norwegian Air Shuttle demonstrated it's faith in the aircraft by placing a US$3.1bn (UK£1.5bn) order for 42 Boeing 737-800 passenger jets with an option to buy 42 more, having already ordered 11 in May this year.Four bombings in two days have left over 130 dead in Iraq, with at least as many injured. Al Jazeera reports that at least 60 were killed in the two explosions at a tomb in Baghdad today. Unlike yesterday's attacks, one of which was also in Baghdad, today's attacks happened in rapid succession. Two gates of the Shia tomb were targeted shortly before the Friday prayer - a time at which it would be crowded. The BBC states the suicide bombers were two women.According to police reports yesterday, at least 76 people were killed in the two separate suicide bombings that happened Thursday. A further 63 people were reported injured that day. Five children were among the casualties.48 people were killed by a suicide bomber in a restaurant in the northeastern Iraqi town of Baquba. The other blast had occurred in Baghdad, when a suicide bomber detonated a belt full of explosives near a group of police officers giving supplies to Iraqis displaced by sectarian violence."It is a suicide bomber. Obviously that has the fingerprints of al-Qaeda," said a Baghdad security spokesman, Major-General Qassim Moussawi, commenting yesterdays attack.Abdulnasir al-Muntasirbillah, the governor of Diyala, condemned the attacks. "Words can't express it. It is a dirty, cowardly terrorist act," he said yesterday.Issam Salim, a witness to Thursday's Baghdad attack, described his experiences to the Associated Press: "I turned around as I fell to the ground and saw a big fire break out with black smoke. Women and children are crying from pain beside me in the hospital. Some of them suffered burns."A major storm suspected to be a tornado has reportedly killed four Boy Scouts camping at the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa. Roughly ninety-five Scouts aged thirteen to eighteen and twenty-five adult staff members were believed to be camping at the time the alarm was raised. Most of the scouts were from Omaha-Metro Area, including Omaha and Bellevue, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, Iowa. It is believed that the scouts had as little as twelve minutes to seek shelter from the time the alarm began to the time the storm hit. Early reports stated that thirty to forty scouts had been injured, that number was later reduced to twenty. A spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America's Mid American Council, the region in which the camp was situated, has stated that the storm activated sirens but she couldn't confirm whether the scouts were staying in tents or buildings.The Scouts were participating in a training exercise at the 1,800 acre ranch roughly 40 miles northeast of Omaha. Julie Tack, a spokesperson for Iowa Homeland Security, stated that the camp was littered with debris and downed tree branches after being struck by a tornado at or around 7:00 PM Central Daylight Time. Tack went on to say that a search and rescue team had been deployed to the area. Camp counselors have stated that they were aware of the possibilities that storm was coming and they had heard the tornado sirens going off. There was no underground shelter for the scouts, however they had shelters designated and emergency plans had been discussed the first day of camp. Officials said most of the boys were on a hike when storms moved in.A camp staff member said that many scouts were injured when a fireplace in one of the shelters collapsed. Most of the injured scouts were treated at hospitals in Sioux City and Missouri Valley, Iowa. Six scouts were brought to the Missouri Valley hospital, most treated for minor injuries and broken bones. One scout suffered a broken hip and was transferred to Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha. Mercy Medical Center, in Sioux City, have reported two patients arriving by helicopter at 8:13 PM with a third arriving by ambulance. A fourth patient arrived later, again by helicopter. A spokesman for the hospital said the victims are all juveniles and all have serious injuries. Mercy does not expect to receive more camp victims. The names of the victims have not been released.At least four children are among seven killed in Dinuba, California after a police chase ended in a crash.Reports say the crash happened around 2:45 p.m. (PDT) on Saturday in a rural area of Tulare County. Police were pursuing a suspect who, after refusing to stop, slammed into a GMC Sierra pickup truck carrying two adults and five children. Four of the children were ejected from the truck and died at the scene. The two adults and one child were taken to Community Regional Medical Center located in Fresno where they are being treated for minor to severe injuries.According to KFSN-TV, after the suspect slammed into the car, both vehicles landed against trees in a lemon tree orchard at the intersection of Avenue 424 and Road 120. Three people, including the suspect, were in the pursued car and died at the scene.Police are continuing to investigate the incident.File:Australian SF Afghanistan Oct 2009.jpgLess than two weeks after two Australian soldiers (Diggers) died in the explosion of a roadside bomb, three more Diggers and a US soldier were killed early yesterday morning in a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan, while seven other soldiers are being treated for injuries.Australian Defence Force Chief Angus Houston said in a statement this afternoon that two of the crash survivors are in a serious condition and will be moved with the other survivors to the US military hospital in Begram.The crash occurred at 03:39 yesterday local time (23:09 on Sunday, UTC) in the north of Kandahar province. Although the cause is still unknown, Houston said "the terrain is rugged, the helicopters are often heavily loaded, it’s at high altitude and it was three o’clock in the morning. All of these factors will no doubt be considered". Houston confirmed that enemy fire was not to blame for the crash.These new casualties in the Afghan War brings Australia's death toll to sixteen, while that of the US comes to 1128 since the war began in 2001.Despite this, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, remains firm on the issue: "We work beside our allies [...] to avoid Afghanistan once again becoming a breeding ground for terrorists who can then strike at innocent Australians both at home and abroad" and continued by saying that all Australians owe the soldiers a debt of gratitude for making the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.Although the names of the soldiers have yet to be released, the tragedy follows last week's casualties where Australian combat engineers Darren Smith, age 26, and Jacob Moerland, age 21, were killed along side their bomb sniffer dog, Herbie in a roadside blast.At least four people have been killed and another 26 wounded after a suspected suicide bomb attack near Peshawar, Pakistan killed four people today, according to police.The explosion occurred at a police station in Badaber, located about twelve kilomtres from Peshawar. The blast damaged the station and a mosque, and completely destroyed several shops and other buildings located nearby."The death toll is four and there are 26 injured," commented a doctor for the Lady Reading Hospital, Zafar Iqbal. Liaqat Ali Khan, a local police official said to the Associated Press news agency that security officials started shooting at a vehicle as it drove up to a checkpoint near the police station. The driver, however, managed to set off the explosives."We have beefed up checks at entry and exit points to and from the tribal areas and that's why these blasts are taking place at our checkposts and our men are laying down their lives," Khan told the Associated Press.According to reports, three US soldiers and a civilian contractor have been killed in southern Afghanistan, when a US helicopter crashed. Other passengers aboard the aircraft were hurt, and were transferred to a medical base close by.According to a statement by the International Security Assistance Force, the crash happened about eleven kilometres west of the city of Qalat in the Zabul province late on Thursday. The helicopter that went down was a CV-22 Osprey.The cause of the crash is currently unclear, although a spokesman for the Taliban claimed responsibility for shooting it down. The Associated Press, however, says that the group frequently exaggerates claims.Marine Major Shawn Turner commented that this was the first time an Osprey went down in a war zone during operations.With this crash, a total of 151 foreign soldiers have been killed this year in Afghanistan.An overnight explosion and fire at a Washington State oil refinery in Anacortes, Washington, United States, a city about 80 miles south of Vancouver, Canada, yesterday killed four people and critically injured three others.A Tesoro Corp. refinery caught fire at about 0030 local time (0830 GMT) while maintenance work was being performed in preparation for returning a part of the plant to operation in a dangerous procedure involving increasing heat and pressure in the unit involved. Some people reportedly felt the explosion, which sent flames as high as the tower in the refinery, from as far as five miles away.  The fire, whose cause is not yet known, burned for around an hour and a half before being extinguished.Initially, Tesoro announced that three people had died in the fire. According to a spokesperson from Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, a fourth person, a 29-year-old woman, later died from her injuries at the hospital, while three other people, a woman and two men, all remain in critical condition with major burns. Three of the dead were named as Matthew Bowen, Darren Hoines and Daniel Aldridge, while the person who died in the hospital has not been identified. According to CNN, three workers are still missing, and a search has begun for them. The incident was the first fire at an oil refinery in Anacortes since 2007, when a fire at the Shell Puget Sound Refinery damaged a storage, resulting in three minor injuries. A Tesoro-owned refinery was involved in another fire in 2002, also with no reported injuries.In Mexico, gunmen opened fire on the occupants of an ambulance Wednesday, resulting in the deaths of the ambulance driver, two kidney patients, and a female fourth individual travelling in the vehicle. The incident occurred in Ciudad Juárez, close to the Mexico–United States border.Witnesses recalled sighting a pick up truck carrying the gunmen deliberately colliding with the ambulance and forcing it to stop, then the gunmen getting out of the truck and shooting the victims. The ambulance driver, who was impacted in the head by a bullet, seemed to be the gunmen's intended target, according to Mexican authorities.No specific reason has been suggested for the killings at this stage. However, it is understood that Ciudad Juárez, adjacent to El Paso, Texas on the United States side of the border, has drug-related businesses currently in a dispute with each other.Over 1800 people have been killed in Ciudad Juárez this year compared to over three thousand murders last year, according to Voice of America. Ciudad Juárez is one of the most significant locations in the Mexican Drug War, which was launched by Felipe Calderón, the current President of Mexico, in 2006. Since then, about thirty thousand deaths have been recorded as Calderón has proceeded against the drug cartels.High winds and heavy rains have left 4 people dead, and much of the Seattle, Washington area is without electrical power.  A number of large trees have been downed and heavy rains have caused minor flooding in many areas of the city.  According to first-hand reports as many as 1 million people and several large organizations such as Microsoft are without power this morning.Flood, storm, and strong wind watches were in effect last night as a rare thunderstorm system moved into the Pacific Northwest region, hitting areas from Seattle to Portland with high winds and heavy rains. Interstate 5 through Seattle was closed at its intersection with Mercer Street due to standing water. The State Route 520 floating bridge, a major conduit across Lake Washington to the technology-rich Eastside was closed and its drawspan opened to protect it from storm damage well into Friday. Local roads throughout the region were strewn with debris, especially evergreen branches and leaves. Authorities advised people to stay off the roads.Four deaths were reported in connection with the storm as of Friday. A Seattle woman died in the basement of her home after floodwaters caused the basement door to close and jam shut. Two others died in outlying areas after tall Northwest evergreens fell on their vehicles, and a man in Grays Harbor, near the Pacific coast, died in his sleep after a tree fell on his mobile home. KOMO news reported a caller saying a 100-foot evergreen had fallen into his house. Downed trees and high winds also brought down powerlines throughout Western Washington. Seattle City Light, the municipal electric utility for the city, reported a peak of 175,000 customers without power, most in the north and south ends of the city, as well as the east edge of town and the Green Lake area. Puget Sound Energy, the electric utility for much of the Seattle metro area, reported 700,000 customers (over 66%) without power, with the area around Seattle the worst hit. PSE, which had already enlisted additional powerline workers from neighboring states, did not send crews out until mid Friday morning due to continued high winds. Estimates for power restoration were anywhere from a few days to over a week. Island County, at the mouth of Puget Sound, was completely without power.Schools in Seattle and throughout its suburbs were closed Friday, many due to power outages. The city of Mercer Island, connected to the mainland only by Interstate 90, is reportedly inaccessible.The Seattle Post-Intelligencer failed to print due to power failures at the printing facility, which had redundant power feeds from both the Seattle utility as well as PSE. It is the first time in 70 years that the paper has not been printed. The Seattle Times, a competing paper under a joint operating agreement, managed to print only 13,000 copies of its regular circulation of over 200,000. The papers located alternate facilities to print a reduced version of their Saturday editions, and their joint Sunday issue was also expected to be reduced.At Sea-Tac Airport, three terminals were shut down overnight due to the storm.

A resident in the area, Yolly Andrias told Xinhua that "they were still sleeping when the strong quake awoke them."An 8.0 earthquake struck the region in 1976, generating a tsunami which devastated 700 kilometers of coastline in the Sulu Archipelago and southern Mindanao island. The region includes faults in the Sulu Trench in the Sulu Sea and the Cotabato Trench, a subduction zone crossing the Celebes Sea and the Moro Gulf.At least four families have been left homeless after a fire ripped through an apartment in a four-apartment building at 630-632 Plymouth Avenue in Buffalo, New York. One person had to jump out of a second floor window to get to safety and one firefighter was injured while fighting the blaze.At approximately 4:30 p.m. (Eastern time) firefighters were called to the building after initial calls reported that an oven had caught on fire after grease had spilled in Apt. #4. When firefighters arrived, Apt. #4 was completely engulfed in flames."When [the firefighters] arrived, one person was trapped on the second floor, but jumped out of a window to the neighbors second floor porch. The fire started in a kitchen oven, maybe by grease, but an investigation is being conducted," said Buffalo Fire Department Chief Joe Fahey."One firefighter was injured," added Fahey. Catalano, the injured firefighter, and whose first name is not known, received a small cut under his left eye, but did not require hospitalization and was treated at the scene by paramedics.It is estimated that there is at least "US$100,000 in damage. $60,000 damage to the building and $40,000 to the contents," said Fahey. At least three floors and two apartments were severely damaged by the fire.All of the building's occupants made it out safely, and none were injured. Arson is not believed to be the cause.A helicopter crash in the Mourne Mountains is believed to have killed four people in Northern Ireland.Just before 4 pm local time (1500 UTC) the police received reports of a "plane in distress" from residents. The helicopter is believed to have crashed in an area called Leitrim Lodge located between Hilltown and Rostrevor. The Democratic Unionist representative for the region has said "the local community was shocked and now feared the worst."The local fire services, police and the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team are currently combing the area from the wreckage. The Air Accident Investigation Branch has been notified about the incident.Four dead bodies have been discovered in two separate locations within the town of Leicester, in Leicestershire, England, United Kingdom. All four individuals are thought to be from the same family unit, with one man, one woman and two children among the dead.On Friday night, Aram Abdul Razaq Aziz, who was male and aged 32, was discovered deceased in Watermead Country Park. On Saturday afternoon, the body of 24-year-old Joy Small was discovered in an apartment on Jersey Road. Her son, three-year-old Aubarr Aziz and her daughter Chanarra, aged two, were discovered alongside her and were also found to be dead.Post-mortem examinations are anticipated to occur on Monday. A spokesperson for Leicestershire Constabulary stated that "[n]o causes of death have been established at present, but the deaths of the woman and children are being treated as suspicious. Inquiries are at an early stage, but officers are not looking for anyone else at this time."According to BBC News, police have been involved in previous incidents with the family.The European Union (EU) has allowed four Indonesian airlines back into their airspace. A blanket ban had been placed on Indonesian air carriers in 2007. The EU has now added every Zambian airline and all but one from Kazakhstan to their blacklist.The four airlines allowed to fly into Europe are state-owned flag carrier Garuda Indonesia, privately owned scheduled carrier Mandala Airlines and two private chartered airlines dealing mainly with western clients, Airfast Indonesia and Premiair.The decision to place the nation's fleet on the list of air carriers banned in the European Union followed a string of accidents, as well as a safety audit by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The accidents included the Adam Air Flight 574 disaster, where an airliner vanished from radar and crashed, Adam Air Flight 172, a nonfatal accident in which a plane cracked in half after landing and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, a runway overrun that killed 21.The ICAO had issued 600 safety recommendations to Indonesia. According to foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda, there are 69 requirements issued to the airlines by the EU, of which 62 have been met. Indonesia has also made improvements to its safety infrastructure, introducing better inspections. Earlier this year, five airlines had their operating certificates revoked for failing inspections.The EU said the decision was made as a result of "significant improvements and accomplishments of the Indonesian civil aviation authority" which "are recognised in the area of safety." Garuda plans to launch services to Europe next year.The EU list now also contains all Zambian airlines and every airline from Kazakhstan except Air Astana. Astana has had restrictions put upon its flights to Europe.European Commissioner for Transport Antonio Tajani used these additions as an opportunity to repeat a call for the list to be made global, which he had first suggested after the crash of Yeminia Flight 626 earlier this month."We cannot afford any compromise in air safety," he said. "Citizens have the right to fly safely anywhere in the world. It is high time that the international community rethinks safety policy. Those airlines which are unsafe should not be allowed to fly anywhere."The only other modification to the list was to Angolan flag carrier TAAG. Previously banned completely, they will now be allowed to fly some of their aircraft into Portugal, with operating restrictions. The move comes after the Portuguese and Angolan civil aviation bodies signed a deal to co-operate to improve safety.Four people have been injured after a series of earthquakes struck West Sumatra in Indonesia. They were wounded by falling masonry while fleeing Padang.Sudirman Gani, head of the local administration's politics and national unity division, stated that "the first quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale was recorded at 2:48 p.m. It was followed by a 5.2-magnitude quake at 3:13 p.m., before the last one, measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale, hit 10 minutes later."The wounded were taken to Yos Sudarso public hospital with minor injuries. The first earthquake occurred 38 miles (45 kilometres) under the Indian Ocean according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Indonesia's meteorological and geophysics agency did not issue a tsunami warning.No-one else was injured by the earthquakes. Ade Edward, West Sumatra's disaster mitigation coordinator, said that "We have told all residents to stay alert and not to worry too much since we will guard the city [Padang]."At least four people have died after one of three military escort helicopters accompanying Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf crashed in Kashmir.The medium-lift Super Puma helicopter was shadowing one carrying the president when the rear of the rotorcraft burst into flame, forcing an emergency crash landing. An army brigadier, two soldiers and a PTV cameraman were killed, and four more were injured, including presidential spokesman Major General Rashid Qureshi. The injured are being treated at a hospital in Muzaffarabad. The pilot walked away unharmed.It is thought to be an accident caused by a technical fault.The helicopters were visiting the scene of a devastating 2005 earthquake to mark the anniversary of the disaster. The president ultimately reached his destination.The Prime Minister of the Ivory Coast, Guillaume Soro, has escaped uninjured after a missile struck his aircraft upon landing at Bouaké Airport, Ivory Coast, killing four others, according to eyewitnesses.According to a United Nations (UN) employee who saw the attack, a total of three missiles were fired. One struck and rebounded off the fuselage and failed to explode, one flew over the top of the aircraft and exploded nearby and one burst through the fuselage and exploded inside the cabin. There were also some gunshots fired.Shortly after the attack, the Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire (New Forces of the Ivory Coast) announced several arrests had been made in connection to the failed assassination attempt.One male New Forces administrative assistant from on board the plane who refused to be identified spoke to the media via telephone from a local hospital where he was being treated for an injury to his arm, and gave the following account of the attack: "There was an explosion and it was panic. The plane had just landed and we waited until the plane came to a stop. We tried to calm people down until the plane stopped...Those who fired must have been in the bush. I didn't see anyone. I don't know if anyone saw them." Allan Aliali, a journalist on board to cover the arrival of Soro, described seeing three dead bodies in the plane, but was unable to identify them. This was later confirmed by New Forces spokesman Sidiki Konate, who said a fourth victim died later from his injuries.A planned ceremony to mark the official return of magistrates to the north under an Ivory Cost peace deal went ahead as scheduled, after which Konate told reporters "Be assured, the most important thing for us is to advance in this peace process and nothing can stop us. This process cannot be assassinated,". Currently, there is a military buffer zone splitting the country in two and policed by the UN, but a new peace deal in March is leading to progress in dismantling it.The UN security council condemned the attack, and urged all involved in the current power conflict to respect the peace deal there. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also gave his personal condemnation of the attack, saying that the peace deal "represents a unique opportunity for a peaceful solution to the protracted Ivorian crisis." The UN security council said it condemned and any attempt to destabilize the peace process by force" and that "The perpetrators of this criminal act must be brought to justice...(it is) critical that all parties continue to work within the framework of the March 4 peace agreement."Security was stepped up in Bouaké after the attack, with a security cordon set up around the New Forces headquarters, troops deployed at the airport and roadblocks set up at various points across the city. Meanwhile, in London and New York prices for cocoa, which the Ivory Coast is the biggest supplier of, rose to their highest levels in four years as news of the attack came through.International Crisis Group analyst Gilles Yabi said of the attack "It's too soon to know who was responsible, but clearly we're thinking about people in Soro's own movement who are not happy with the way things have turned out...The agreement was a real step forward in the peace process, but it was still fragile because the (citizen) identification process had not yet begun...and of course because of tensions in the rebel [New Forces] camp".Four people were killed and another four wounded in an early-morning shooting at a Buffalo, New York restaurant yesterday. The shooting occurred as a party held in the restaurant was coming to a close.At about 2:30 a.m. EDT (06:30 UTC), shots were fired outside the City Grill in downtown Buffalo. The victims were leaving a party in the restaurant, said authorities.

A formal anniversary event was scheduled for a later date, officials said. The couple had married in Texas one year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives. The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of the four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not hurt.Police have not yet released the identities of the victims. Of the three others killed, one was a 26-year-old man and two others were women. Those two were identified as 27-year-old Shawntia McNeil by McNeil's mother, Ruby Martin, and 32-year-old Tiffany Wilhite by Martin and Tiffany Wilhite's father, Raymond Wilhite. Three of the four were pronounced dead at the crime scene, while the fourth died in a hospital. The four injured in the shooting were all men, said authorities. As of Saturday afternoon local time, one was in critical condition at an area hospital, two were in stable condition, and one was in good condition.Latoya Nuness, who witnessed the shooting as she was leaving the restaurant with friends, said, "I’ve never been through anything so crazy." She and her companions then ran into the kitchen for cover. "They were just shooting whoever they could shoot," she said.Police arrested 25-year-old Buffalo resident Keith Johnson in connection with the shooting on Saturday afternoon. Johnson was charged with four counts of second-degree murder. Police do not know if he was a part of the fight that happened inside the City Grill, and have asked witnesses to step forward.An explosion occurred in a bus in the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, in Makati City, Philippines on Tuesday.  The blast occurred in shortly before 2 p.m.  Four are dead with fourteen more wounded.After the explosion, the National Capital Region Police Office's Director, Nicanor Bartolome, said that he formed a special investigation team and the city has formed a crisis management committee. President Benigno Aquino III condoled the grieving families of the dead. The Metro Manila police are now on full alert following the blast. The bus was an air-conditioned model, plate number TXJ-710.After news reached the Malacañang Palace spokesman Eduardo Lacierda said that the cause of the blast was "some sort of explosive device placed in the vicinity of the middle of the bus." Many passengers had already got off before the explosion; almost half disembarked at Ayala.A survivor said that they did not notice the explosion because they were all busy watching television. The bus driver noticed an abnormal smell, namely gunpowder. He stated that mechanical failure could not possibly be the cause. The police are yet to establish what type of explosive was used.Four foreign men have today gone before a court in Hungary on suspicion of people smuggling. Their detention relates to Thursday's discovery of a lorry full of corpses in Austria. The death toll was yesterday finalised at 71.The lorry had been abandoned since Wednesday on the hard shoulder of the "Eastern Motorway", near the Hungarian border. Roadworkers became suspicious of dark liquid seeping from the vehicle, and responding police found the bodies. Initial police estimates were that 20–50 were suffocated in the back of the lorry which was near Parndorf.The arrested men are thought to include the vehicle's owner and at least two drivers. Three are Bulgarian and one is from Afghanistan. Criminal suspects in Hungary can generally be held for 72 hours before charge but prosecutors, citing the seriousness of the case, want the period extended. Extradition to Austria is possible.Of the 71 dead, 59 are men, eight are women, and four are children. The children are thought to be aged three, eight, and ten years, alongside an eighteen-month-old baby. "There was also a Syrian travel document found" police spokesman Hans Peter Doskozil told journalists "so of course our first assumption is that these people were migrants, and likely a group of Syrian migrants. We can rule out that they were Africans".The four accused were escorted into court in Kecskemet, central Hungary, by a police convoy. Reportedly the lorry traveled from Kecskemet. Hungary is presently building a border fence across the Serbian frontier, as migrants from war-torn Syria and other regions seek access to the Schengen Area of free movement, which covers most of the EU.Slovak chicken meat company Hyza, a previous owner, previously told Wikinews the lorry has changed hands several times in roughly the last year. After they sold it they say it was exported to Hungary; it now bears Hungarian plates but still features Hyza branding including pictures of meat.On the day of the discovery Hyza quickly removed a graphic from their homepage featuring cartoon chicken stowaways in a car being inspected at a customs post. The stowaways also appeared with a line through them alongside the word "imigranti" and the site www.imigranti.sk in one corner. On the other side was Hyza's logo. Imigranti.sk is also unavailable.Police today found 26 migrants in a lorry near Braunau am Inn, Austria. The driver, from Romania, refused to stop for police and was arrested following a chase.

The miners have been trapped since 03:00 (08:00 UTC) local time.According to the Under-Secretary of Mining Development, Jorge Espinoza, the men are trapped 500 feet (150 meters) below the surface. Rescuers are currently on the scene and they expect to reach the men within 24 hours.According to a Government Official, the men are believed to be alive "because they were far enough away from the site of the collapse," however their condition is unknown and rescuers have not been able to make contact with them. It is estimated that there is five to six days of breathable air left in the mine. The mine is suspected to have collapsed due to a build up of underground water which caused the mine's supports to buckle and collapse, blocking all exits.According to a confirmed report by police, four officers in the Oakland, California police department have been shot and are in critical condition.

In July of last year, three people were killed when another four-storey building came down in Abuja, the capital of the country.It is still uncertain what caused the incident, although collapses such as these have in the past been blamed on poor building standards and low construction material quality.Fourteen people are presumed dead after a passenger helicopter of the Finnish company Copterline crashed into the Baltic Sea, 5 km off the coast of Estonia.After hours of search, the wreck was found with a sonar at a depth of approximately 60 meters. The cabin is damaged but has remained in one piece, and passengers were found dead inside the cabin. Lifting of the wreckage is being planned at the moment.The Sikorsky S-76 was on a scheduled passenger flight to Helsinki from Tallinn, the Estonian capital. The craft came down just three minutes after take-off at 12:43 pm (GMT+3). According to an eyewitness, two loud bangs were heard before the craft crashed down. No smoke or fire were seen after the bangs.On board were six Finnish, four Estonian and two American passengers as well as two Finnish crew members.Both of the pilots were experienced, with over 10 years of flight experience in the company.Estonian rescue helicopters and boats have been sent, a Finnish rescue helicopter and mini submarines also at the scene.Investigation of the causes of the accident is underway, but one possible reason is the bad weather as the area has been suffering from severe storms recently, the winds at the time are believed to have been 17-20 metres a second. "Many of the helicopters safety measures failed", said the spokesman from Copterline. The safety measures include the ability of the craft to glide down in case of engine failure and the ability to float on water, both of which seemed to have failed. Copterline, one of the largest helicopter airlines in Europe, has cancelled all upcoming flights today, but are continuing as scheduled tomorrow morning.An overview in Estonian (some pics & timeline)French police have today confirmed that they are holding five suspects in the December 11 Algiers bombings.

The vessel split in two and is leaking fuel oil.The Luno had 120–160 cubic metres of fuel aboard when it broke down and high winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater. Helicopters rescued the twelve crewmembers and the only injury was a broken nose. The 100-metre ship was en route to pick up its usual fertiliser cargo and initially officials feared the vessel could spill a load.The ship has split around the breakwater, one part remaining on the rocks at one side and the other pushed almost to the beach on the other. Junior transport, seas, and fishing minister Frederic Cuvillier is heading to Anglet. Anglet is near the Spanish border, with the ship registered in Spain.One eyewitness, commenting to BBC News, called the rescuers "brave considering the state of the sea".

Video from the scene showed the coach, which was owned by an English company, had rolled onto its side.Experts in Frankfurt, Germany defused a World War II-era bomb yesterday, after more than 60,000 people, the most since World War II, evacuated from the area.The HC 4000 blockbuster bomb, dropped by the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force, was discovered days ago near the Goethe University Frankfurt campus in a construction site. Fire chiefs warned its reportedly 1.4 tons of explosives could have destroyed an entire city block.Residents of the Westend neighborhood, including those of two nearby hospitals, were asked to evacuate by 8 a.m. local time (0600 UTC), though the bomb removal process only began around 2:30 p.m., as the evacuation drew on. Just after 8 a.m., Markus Röck, a spokesman for the Frankfurt fire brigade, said: "The situation is relaxed which is a good sign and everything so far is going according to plan. We will now assess if everybody has left voluntarily and go from house to house and remove people if necessary." About 1,100 workers assisted with the evacuation, according to the fire brigade, and helicopters and heat-detection technology were used to check everyone within 1.5 kilometers, about 1 mile, had left. A convention center and concert hall opened to house people, and at museums and the airport, other activities were offered for free.When the area near the bomb was evaluated, other parts of the city became more populated. Peter Cachola Schmal, director of the German Architecture Museum, remarked, "It's a different atmosphere here today, because people are settling for a longer time[...] People are coming here to sit with their laptop and work, for example, or read the newspaper for hours."Fire brigade director Reinhard Ries said, "the scale of this bomb is overwhelming. I have never seen anything like it."Likely thousands of unexploded bombs from the era remain across Germany, and reportedly eleven bomb defusal technicians have been killed there since 2000. Devices may become more unstable as time wears on and their fuses age.Two brothers were swept away and a woman was pulled to safety on Sunday after a wave, said to be 5-6 metres (17-20 feet) high, washed over their funeral service in Spain’s Canary Islands.The massive wave struck while a party of 15 was spreading the ashes of a 16 year old boy in the sea, according to Manuel Sosa, one of the rescuers. The boy’s father, age 36, and a paternal uncle, age 23, were swept away and are presumed dead. The mother, age 34, was caught in the wave, but rescued.The tragedy occurred near the village of Arucas on Gran Canaria Island.The Norwegian Dawn, a 965-foot-long luxury vessel, was struck by “a freak wave that caused two windows to break in two different cabins,” the owners, Norwegian Cruise Line, said in a statement. It changed course, docking in Charleston late Saturday afternoon instead of completing its planned travel to New York.The wave, estimated at 7-stories-high, flooded 62 cabins and injured 4 passengers with cuts and bruises. Company spokeswoman Susan Robison said the wave reached to deck 10.The hull was damaged but the vessel was not in any trouble, according to the Coast Guard, and the safety of the ship “was in no way compromised by this incident.” Passengers were told to don their flotation jackets anyway.The ship left New York last Sunday on a week-long round-trip cruise to and from the Bahamas.American freesolo rock climber John Bachar was injured in a car crash in Nevada, in which a co-passenger was killed. At approxiamately 7:25 p.m. on Sunday, August 13, Forty-nine year-old Bachar of Mammoth Lakes, California, 49, was driving southbound on U.S. Route 93, about 33 miles north of Ely, Nevada, when he allowed his Toyota 4Runner to drift off the west edge of the road and struck a mile-marker post. Bachar overcorrected to the left, causing the Toyota to rotate counterclockwise and travel across both lanes to the east side of the road.The vehicle began to rollover towards its right side at this point, and a passenger was ejected. Steve Karafa of El Sobrante, California, 40, who had been sleeping in the back seat when the accident occurred, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. Bachar suffered numerous injuries in the crash, including four fractured vertibrae, and was transported to the William B. Ririe Hospital in Ely. A third passenger, Anastasia Frangos of Santa Paula, California, 33, was not seriously injured.The trio was travelling home from the Outdoor Retailer Trade Show in Salt Lake City, Utah, where they had been represententing Acopa International LLC. Nevada Highway Patrol trooper Rocky Gonzalez said driver inattention and speed contributed to this accident, as well as two other crashes in the nearby area over the same weekend.A freighter hit a fishing boat around midnight on Sunday morning in the Gulf of Suez in the Red Sea. Of the 40 Egyptian fisherman on board, thirteen are dead and thirteen more missing.Survivor Al Sayyed Mohamed Arafat told local media he jumped from the fishing boat, named Badr al-Islam, as the container ship approached. He says he hung onto a wooden crate for four hours before rescue. Local authorities have promised compensation to each survivor.A vessel, flagged in Panama, suspected to be involved in the collision has been detained by the military.  The army said yesterday one victim raised the alarm by phone and the military sent four boats and a helicopter to commence search and rescue off the Gabal al-Zayt coastline. A plane has since joined the search. The military say the fishing boat lacked safety equipment for emergency communications.The detained ship was found south of the Gulf, near the port of Safaga. It was carrying 220 tonnes of cargo according to the General Authority for the Red Sea Ports.An appeals court in Eastern France has confirmed the Swedish car manufacturer Volvo is guilty over the deaths of two schoolchildren aged nine and ten and the serious injury of a third after a brakes failure caused an accident in 1999.The Volvo 850 TDI was being driven by a local teacher when it struck the children, who had been on their way to school. Driver Catherine Kohtz later asserted that the brake pedal had become stiff and the brakes themselves unresponsive as she traveled along the steep road.Expert examination of the vehicle after the crash confirmed that the braking system was flawed. Volvo had known there was a potential issue with the brakes but had not issued a recall of the affected cars for modifications.The court confirmed Volvo should pay a 200,000 euro fine. The court also confirmed that Kohtz should pay a 300 euro fine and receive a six-month suspended sentence and temporary revocation of her driving license for failure to control the Volvo.The ruling also said that two French national papers should cover the decision.Multiple passengers were injured and five were killed when their tour bus crashed and rolled on the Highway 101 overpass near Soledad, Monterey County, California. There were 34 French tourists, an American driver and a French Canadian tour guide on board the bus when it overturned.On Tuesday afternoon about 3:30 P.M., at the Camphora Gloria Road overpass, the bus rolled, and three or four passengers flew from the bus, over the freeway guardrail to the railway tracks.Wednesday morning, Maia Carroll, communications coordinator for Monterey County, confirmed that five people had died due to the accident.First reports indicated it was a multiple vehicle accident, however the reason that the bus went out of control is still under investigation. Three people were declared dead at the scene of the accident and two others died in hospital.  "At this time, it appears to just be a solo-vehicle incident, meaning just the tour bus itself was involved," said California Highway Patrol (CHP) spokesman Brian Wiest, "It's a tragedy. It's certainly one of worst I've seen in a long time."The three patients who were the first to arrive at the Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital were all in a critical condition. Some of the injured were taken to the Lee Memorial Hospital in King City, other critically injured were being sent to the Bay area. So far eight people have been reported in critical condition. At least fifteen ambulances, and seven helicopter ambulances were dispatched to the scene.  A thirteen year old is being treated in Fesno Community Regional Medical Center. Patients are being treated at over eight hospitals in the area.The CHP closed all lanes of the highway in both directions and reported multiple fatalities.The tour bus was operated by Orion Pacific Charter Bus Co. and was traveling from San Francisco to Santa Maria. The French tourists involved in the accident arrived on April the 19th to tour California. They were returning to Los Angeles from where they were to continue to France when the accident happened.  The tour bus was bought this year and was made for 56 passengers in total.This accident occurred just four days after twenty were killed and 21 injured when a tourist bus collided with a truck in south west China on Saturday.Floods in the eastern state of  Orissa in  India have left 16 dead. Over 180,000 people have been evacuated to safer places, while hundreds of others have taken shelter on national highway and cyclone shelters. The flood, described as the worst since 1982 by officials, has marooned 191 villages. The rising  Mahanadi river over flowed at Mundali along 28 breaches to inundate and cut off several villages. A total of 1.5 million people living in 17 out of 30 districts of Orissa have been affected. Crop areas of over 2,470 square kilometers have been inundated.  Cuttack,  Kendrapara,  Puri  and  Jagatsinghpur  districts are worst affected. All major state rivers and their tributaries are flowing above the danger level due to the heavy  monsoon rains.The new flooding comes just weeks after  Kosi river that flows from  Nepal to India, burst its embankment and submerged nearly 1,000 villages in the neighboring state of  Bihar in the north, killing at least 48 people and driving more than a million others from their homes. "The worst is yet to come," said Benudhar Dash, Additional Relief Commissioner of Orissa.Extreme drought conditions this summer have reduced many of Texas' freshwater lakes to a fraction of their usual water levels. Central Texas, home to Lake Buchanan and Lake Travis, has seen severe effects of the drought. Those two lakes are currently 45 percent full and further drops in water levels are anticipated.  Austin, the state's capital, has recorded 70 days of 100-degree heat already this summer.The state saw less than an inch of rainfall in July alone. Residents of Henderson county are concerned that Lake Palestine has reached levels which haven't been seen since the 1980's. Some report that fishing in general has been hard-hit. Residents also report excessive sightings of snakes in and around residential areas near the lake, an effect believed to be caused by drought conditions.Collectively, estimates recently showed the state's reservoirs to be at 68% capacity. Chris Ransom of Houston told Wikinews on August 21 that Sheldon Reservoir is "all dried up now." He went on to state that Lake Houston water levels have dropped significantly this summer. He also stated that, while an avid fisherman, he's ceased almost all such activities within the past few weeks. Meteorologist Bob Rose told news sources that heat conditions are likely to continue into September.Friendly fire between two groups of police officers killed five on Saturday night in Knyazhychi, Ukraine.Police had aimed to arrest suspects accused of robbery in Kiev and the surrounding area. A surveillance unit staking out a building placed two undercover officers in an empty, partially-constructed building next door. When an alarm in the empty building summoned regular police, the two undercover officers were mistaken for burglars and detained.Surveillance officers saw their colleagues being loaded into a van and, evidently fearing the robbery gang was taking them hostage, attempted to rescue them by force.  Shots were exchanged. The three nearby robbery suspects heard the gun battle and fled; they were arrested in Kiev. The trio were armed and face charges.The dead are two undercover officers, two regular officers of the state security force, and one member of the special-forces surveillance unit. President Petro Poroshenko has been briefed by a senior police officer. Khatia Dekanoidze, ex-head of the nation's police, said it was a "heartbreaking tragedy".Fires broke out at the Fukushima Daiichi plant's No. 4 reactor in Japan on Tuesday, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company. The first fire caused a leak of concentrated radioactive material, according to the Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan.The first fire broke out at 9:40 a.m. local time on Tuesday, and was thought to have been put out, but another fire was discovered early on Wednesday, believed to have started because the earlier one had not been fully extinguished.In a televised statement, the prime minister told residents near the plant that "I sincerely ask all citizens within the 20 km distance from the reactor to leave this zone." He went on to say that "[t]he radiation level has risen substantially. The risk that radiation will leak from now on has risen."Kan warned residents to remain indoors and to shut windows and doors to avoid radiation poisoning.The French Embassy in Japan reports that the radiation will reach Tokyo in 10 hours, with current wind speeds.Police have arrested three more men in connection with the failed terror attacks of the past few days on London and Glasgow bringing the total number of arrests to eight.Sky News has revealed the identity of one of the practising doctors arrested yesterday as Dr Mohammed Asha, who trained in Jordan before coming to the UK to practise. Police are continuing house raids throughout the country, in Paisley, Merseyside and Staffordshire. One suspect, badly burned after the attack on Glasgow airport, is currently receiving treatment at the Royal Alexandra Hospital.The eighth suspect was arrested abroad this evening, but police are refusing to reveal details of the country in which the arrest took place. It has been revealed that five of those arrested are qualified doctors, practising in the UK, three of those in the Royal Alexandra Hospital.  The UK's terror threat warning level remains "critical", meaning that an attack could be imminent. Heavy security is in evidence at airports and public transport centres, with many airports asking passengers not to bring vehicles close to the terminal buildings. This evening, at around 1900 BST, Stansted Airport, Essex. was closed for a short time following the discovery of a suspicious bag.  The owner of the bag was arrested while the airport closed its doors, not allowing passengers into or out of it. The BBC reports that, by 2035, the airport had been fully re-opened. The owner of the bag remains under arrest, but not for terrorism related offences.Strathclyde Police is continuing its appeal for any details of earlier movements of the green Jeep Cherokee with registration L808 RDT, which was driven into the terminal building at Glasgow International Airport.The Metropolitan Police has now taken over the inquiry, with suspects held in Scotland to be moved to London.The pilot of the Boeing 737 which crashed on March 7 upon landing at Yogyakarta Airport after a domestic Indonesian flight, has been forced by his airline to resign. The crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 killed twenty-one people, most being Indonesian nationals and five being Australians, following a visit by then Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.Garuda sent the pilot, Marwoto Komar, an ultimatum requesting his resignation with which he complied. Had he failed to do so, his employment would have been terminated. The news coincides with police officials forwarding to prosecutors some documents recommending that Komar be charged with negligent manslaughter over the crash, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment.The final report into the disaster found that Mr Komar ignored fifteen activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System informing him he was attempting to land too fast. After touching down at double the maximum safe speed, the aircraft overshot the runway and caught fire.Kamal Firdaus, legal representative of Mr Komar, said "We regret Garuda so soon giving Marwoto the option of being fired or resigning." Mr Komar was arrested early this month, but was subsequently released on bail on February 15. He is thought to be the first pilot to face prosecution for an aviation accident or incident in Indonesia.Indonesian national Marwoto Komar has been released on bail having earlier been arrested over the March 7 crash of a Boeing 737 he was piloting. Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 overshot the runway at Yogyakarta Airport whilst landing after a scheduled domestic passenger flight, leaving 21 Indonesian and Australian passengers dead, out of 140 on board.The subsequent investigation by the National Transport Safety Committee concluded with report released in November that found the aircraft had approached at far in excess of safe landing speeds, with Komar ignoring 15 activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) as well as his co-pilot requesting an emergency go-around as the plane touched down.Muchtar Yudhi, legal representative of Mr Komar, told El Shinta radio today that authorities had accepted a request to release Komar on bail, he having been arrested nearly two weeks ago in Yogyakarta. He said Komar remains a suspect of manslaugher, but that he will continue to co-operate with police.He also said that under global aviation law "if a plane crash occurred, the pilot cannot face criminal investigation".The police say they intend to prosecute him for negligence and will now charge him when he returns to court. He is thought to be the first pilot to be prosecuted over a crash in Indonesian history, which also contains a poor aviation safety record.The Indonesian Pilot's Association has also said that the criminal prosecution should be avoided, arguing that the only people who can judge whether mistakes were made in aviation are those professionally involved and not the police. There were protests in Jakarta demanding his release and dozens of pilots across the nation also campaigned. Two survivors, Adrianus Meliala and Retno Gunowati, went to the House of Representatives (DPR) on Wednesday to challenge those opposed to legal processes against the pilot.The London-based International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA) commented that they were "saddened" to hear the news. IFALPA contends that further investigations are needed into the crash, and that criminal proceedings could prevent an accurate version of events from ever being known. A statement was released that read as follows: "The Federation expects that Capt. Komar will be released ... as he has agreed to fully cooperate with the police investigation and clearly poses no danger to society. He remains a professional who was involved in an unfortunate tragedy." Alexander Downer, Australian foreign minister at the time of the crash, earlier said "...I am very glad that they have reached a point now where they have charged the captain of the aircraft." Several people involved were Australian journalists following Downer on a visit to Indonesia."Thanks to the chief of the Indonesian Police and the chief of Yogyakarta Police... I'm glad now that I can meet my family again." Komar said upon his release.Komar has earlier been under police surveillance, during which time he was receiving psychological treatment. He has had his pilot's license suspended.A new theory has emerged as in to why the pilot of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 attempted to land at a hugely excessive speed, despite 15 automated warnings he was flying too quickly and the co-pilot's call for a 'go-around' procedure to be performed. 21 people were killed in the March 7 crash of the Boeing 737-400 passenger jetliner.Stephanus Geraldus, head of the Garuda pilots association, said that problems at home and a lack of sleep may have affected Marwoto Komar's judgement. The news comes as Indonesian authorities announce they are pressing ahead with a possible prosecution.The final report into the disaster, released on Monday, found that Komar, 45, had exhibited what was described as a "fixation" to land the plane, resulting in the excessively fast approach."If you look at his long flying experience, it's impossible that he would try to land at that speed," Captain Geraldus said, adding that marrital problems with wife Norma Andriani, a former air hostess, were "common knowledge". This was backed up by Dudi Sudibyo, an analyst at Angkasa magazine (translated: 'Airspace')."I understand he was arguing with his wife until late that night," said Sudibyo, who went on to express concern at the lack of addressal of potential mental problems on the part of the pilot in the report. Sudibyo is himself a licensed pilot.Lack of sleep may also have contributed. Both Komar and Gagam Rochmana, the flight's co-pilot, reported for duty at 4:30 a.m., with the flight departing Jakarta for Yogyakarta as scheduled at 6 a.m. "What I want to know now is: why he didn't report that lack of sleep and ask to be shifted to the next flight, or maybe he felt extremely confident he could fly - overconfident," Sudibyo specualted. The report did not find any explicit evidence that they were unfit to fly, but did comment that "they did not provide the investigation with information about (their) activities during the 72 hours prior to commencing duty".Police officials have commented that a prosecution is likely with the only personnel required to complete the case against the pilot and co-pilot being expert witnesses, and that the pilots had been grounded since the accident. "We're looking to prosecute under criminal negligence causing death and serious injury," Inspector-General Adiwinoto said."We need witnesses who can prove there was negligence, and since this was an aviation matter, that could be someone from the National Safety Transportation Committee, or it could also be a medical doctor because of the deaths and injuries."We have been proceeding with this investigation all along, but we needed enough preliminary evidence, which we now do have, with the report that says, yes, there was human negligence." He also said that the airline may itself be prosecuted for failing to provide necessary training to the flight crew. This new development comes at the same time as six Garuda Boeing 737-400s are grounded for failure to comply with import regulations.The trial of Captain Marwoto Komar is set to begin this week. The first pilot to be prosecuted over an aircraft accident in Indonesia, he is being charged over the March 7, 2007 crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 at Yogyakarta International Airport, a disaster which killed 21 people.The final report by the National Transport Safety Commission found that Komar had attempted to land the aircraft, a Boeing 737, at an unsafely high speed and steep angle, resulting in the plane overshooting the runway and bursting into flames. It further said that he ignored fifteen activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System telling him he was approaching too fast, as well as a request by the co-pilot to abort the landing.According to Muhammad Assegaf, a member of Captain Komar's defense team, the trial begins on Thursday in Yogyakarta's Slemen District Court. When asked about the nature of the charges, deputy attorney general for general offenses Abdul Hakim Ritonga told reporters "It is complicated...but both aviation and criminal codes can be used," and that the charges would be of fatal negligence.Most of those killed in the disaster were Indonesians, but five Australians were also killed. They were part of a group sent ahead of Australia's then foreign minister Alexander Downer to accompany him on a visit.There is much controversy surrounding the prosecution. A group of pilots protested his initial arrest, saying he should appear before an aviation tribunal. Instead, he is set to be tried before five judges.An explosion on Thursday morning destroyed a state maternity hospital in Mexico City, Mexico. A nurse and two babies are dead.Initially reports placed the fatalities at seven. Local officials including Mexico City Health Secretary Armando Ahued and Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera have since revised the figure downwards. Over 70 people including 20 infants are wounded. Around 100 people were in the building at the time.The explosion occurred as a truck was resupplying the hospital's gas tanks, and a leak developed in the supply hose. Driver Julio César Martínez and assistants Carlos Chavez and Salvador Alatorre have been arrested. Chavez and Alatorre spent around fifteen minutes attempting to stem the leak, to no avail. All three are amongst the injured.Firefighters and federal police entered the ruins to recover trapped survivors. Victims' relatives, and other bystanders, gathered at police cordons around the scene. "I am still a little bit in shock. It was a nightmare," said nurse Ivonne Lugo Durantes. Durantes was rescued after ten minutes trapped beneath debris. She has first degree burns but is "grateful to have another chance to keep living, to keep working as a nurse." She witnessed other staff rescuing babies amid a conflagration. New father Jose Eduardo told reporters his wife ran barefoot with their baby to escape. Eduardo said some escaped nude. Witnesses around the hospital reported a strong smell of gas, a large explosion, and flying debris. Ambulances and helicopters were used to evacuate casualties.President Enrique Pena Nieto and Pope Francis both took to Twitter to express support for the victims.An explosion at a shopping center in the northern Russian city of Ukhta has resulted in several fatalities, a fire and dozens of injuries. Rescuers raised the death toll to 24 on Tuesday. At least 30 people have been injured.The explosion occurred in a shop called "Passazh" at 1:58pm local time (9:58am UTC). Local police have said that the explosion was caused by a gas canister. Ukhta is an important industrial city in the Komi Republic of northwestern Russia. Its population is around 100,000 and is located near rich gas and oil reserves.Wikinews has learned that an explosion was heard in the Riverside Gardens area of Hammersmith, London, England at around 11:15 a.m. local time. According to reports, an apartment on Macbeth Street exploded due to a gas leak.  An official with the gas company was reporting to the scene after a neighbor called about a gas leak.  When the official arrived, the apartment exploded.  No major injuries were reported, but at least five people on scene at the time of the explosion were treated for symptoms of shock.  No one was inside the apartment.  At the time, nearly 100 residents were evacuated from the area."The gas board were called by the neighbour to a smell of gas in the road. The engineer was directly in front, but luckily he had gone into his van to get his detection equipment when the flat exploded," said Mark McHenry, the senior official with the fire department.A video had shown smoke and dust rising from an apartment block, with black smoke from a fire several minutes later. At approximately 12:00 p.m., no more smoke was seen rising from the area.Nearly a whole block of apartments were severely damaged in the blast. One witness told BBC that "when you looked down Macbeth Street you could see bits of buildings, glass, wood, curtains, strewn all over the street."Authorities believe a gas main had been punctured causing the leak, but an investigation is ongoing.A gas leak in a Homecenter Sodimac hardware store in Santa Cruz, Chile led authorities to evacuate the building and the nearest supermarket, La Fama.The Santa Cruz Fire Bureau and the police officials quickly arrived at the store, where at least two people were reported unconscious by Carabineros of Santa Cruz. The cause of the leak has not been determined.Santa Cruz is located in Chile's Colchagua Valley, around 200 kilometers (124.3 miles) from Santiago, the capital of Chile, and 90 kilometers (55.9 miles) from Pichilemu, capital of Cardenal Caro Province.London, UK -- Commuters in the South East today discovered that it's not only problems at Clapham Junction that can cause disruption to more travellers from more than one of the major London stations. A single gas leak near Battersea Park Junction interrupted services to and from both Waterloo and Victoria stations, the 2 main termini covering the areas "south of the river" in the metropolis.The incident occurred around lunchtime, with trains being cancelled and delayed, and even once the leak had been repaired, the knock-on effects from the earlier disruptions caused delays to peak hour commuters returning home.  The situation was not aided by differential information being made available on travel news sources, a phenomenon that has become a familiar story since the once-unified British Rail was split up into an infrastructure operator and a number of different Train Operating Companies (TOCs).A hydrogen sulphide leak at a fertiliser factory in China has left six people dead and a further 28 ill. The poisonous gas escaped the Anning Qitian Chemical Fertiliser Co. plant in Kunmin, Yunnan's provincial capital.The leak occurred yesterday but was only reported today. The injured received treatment and are said to be in a stable condition. The factory belonged to the Anning Qitian Chemical Fertiliser Company.The leak has now been contained. It is not thought to have had an environemntal effect.China's industries have a poor safety record, with coal mines having the worst, suffering 3,800 deaths last year according to government statisics. The government also said that 101,480 people died last year in road and industrial accidents, and although no further elaboration was given, it is thought a fifth of them were due to industrial accidents.A gas line at Lake Weatherford, Texas exploded Monday afternoon. No one was injured in the explosion, though several vehicles were completely destroyed in the explosion. Flames are reported to be at least a hundred feet into the air.Workers were laying pipes near pipes that were already installed and running, when the explosion occurred. As many as 20 workers were working on the site of the explosion when flames broke out. The local fire department has not ascertained exactly how many people were at the scene.At least 10 cars can be seen on fire near the site of the explosion and homes and businesses in North Parker County have no power due to the fire.Three people were hospitalized with injuries after a series of explosions at Southwest Industrial Gases, Inc., a gas facility in Dallas, Texas. None of their injuries are considered life-threatening.Tanks of oxygen, helium and acetylene began to explode after a connector used to join acetylene tanks during the filling process malfunctioned. The explosions sent flaming debris into the air and onto buildings and expressways. Black smoke that could be seen for miles billowed from the facility. The problem began around 9:30 a.m CDT (UTC-5) at a loading dock, according to Dallas Fire Department Lt. Joel Lavender, and then spread to a trailer housing some 100,000 cubic feet (approximately 28,300 cubic metres) of gas.Authorities evacuated an area that was one-half of a mile (approximately 800 m) wide. Portions of Interstate 35 and Interstate 30 were shut down. Flaming debris ignited small grass fires next to the roads. Tanks were reported to have landed as far away as four blocks.Officials for the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as local and state environmental officials, have deemed air quality levels acceptable following the blast. Hazardous material crews have blocked water used in the fire from entering the Dallas storm drains. "I just advised my teams to get out," said Eddy Parker of Airgas which operates right next to Southwest Industrial. "I didn’t really see anything other than the smoke. Then we turned and ran and just kept hearing explosions.""Given the fact that there haven’t been any fatalities, it seems like our fire department and emergency responders did a great job. But we need to let the fire department look at why this is occurring there in that area," said City Councilman Steve Salazar.Two of the injured men, Randal Bibb, 52, and Daniel McMurry, 56, were taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital to be treated for upper-body burns. The third, an unidentified truck-driver, was treated and released at Methodist Dallas Medical Center. He hurt his back when he jumped from the cab of his truck.Reports say that hundreds of people are dead after a gasoline pipeline exploded in the northern suburbs of Lagos, Nigeria on Tuesday. "Some of the bodies were so burnt that it would be difficult to recognize them as those of human beings," said one Red Cross official, Kingsley Amori.The Red Cross says that many of the victims can only be identified by looking at the remains of their skulls. Estimates suggest that 200-900 people were killed, and another 60 people received medical treatment."The bodies are scattered over the ground. We can't get close enough because the fire is still burning. We cannot confirm how many hundreds were killed." said secretary-general of the Nigerian Red Cross, Ige Oladimeji.The explosion is believed to have been caused by vandalization in the pipeline. Reports say that thieves used a drill to punch a hole in the pipeline in order to steal gasoline, which is sold on the black market.Fuel was being pumped into the pipes to be distributed for consumer use when it exploded. The pipeline is operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which is owned by the State of Nigeria. Workers have stopped pumping fuel through the pipelines.Up to four times as many women as men died in the December 26  Indian Ocean Tsunami, figures published by Oxfam International today reveal."In some villages it now appears that up to 80% of those killed were women. This disproportionate impact will lead to problems for years to come unless everyone working on the aid effort addresses the issue now. We are already hearing about rapes, harassment and forced early marriages. We all need to wake up to this issue and ensure the protection, inclusion and empowerment of the women that have survived,” said, Becky Buell, Oxfam’s Policy Director.As well as recognition of the disparity, and further research, Oxfam calls for a number of practical measures including assistance for men in affected areas to "adapt to changing gender roles including caring of children" and better protection for women, who may be finding themselves severely outnumbered by men.As well as reporting that workers on the ground have been "becoming increasingly aware that a disproportionate percentage of the fatalities there were female", the study looks in detail at a number of locations in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India, the three countries with greatest death toll from the disaster, and finds consistently that women killed outnumber men.The differences are explained in the report as originating both in differences in ability — more men can swim and climb trees in the affected areas than women, and men are generally physically stronger — as well as in differences in activity that the individuals were engaged in at the time the tsunami struck — many women in Aceh were indoors at home with the children on a Sunday morning, while many men were fishing at sea, or on errands.In India, many of the women were waiting at the sea-shore for men to bring home the catch, when the wave hit. The wave at sea had not yet broken, and so posed no threat to vessels far enough from shore.In Sri Lanka in Batticoloa District, the tsunami hit at the hour women on the east coast usually took their baths in the sea.Women looking after children at the time of the tidal wave were further distracted by trying to save their children, while men away from the house were able to dedicate more of their efforts to saving themselves.Another factor particularly important in Aceh was that many of the men of the region had left to seek work elsewhere, while women stayed behind in their home community, which was almost completely wiped out by the wave.The survey looked at Aceh Besar district of Indonesia, the North Aceh district, the two worst-affected districts of Tamil Naidu in South India, being Nagapattinam and Cuddalore, and used rough statistics and anecdotal information from Sri Lanka, where hard figures are not available.Hours before the Opening Ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympics, 21-year-old Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died after hitting an unpadded pole during a routine training exercise at the Whistler Sliding Centre in Vancouver, Canada on Friday morning.According to those on the scene, blood was "pouring" from the athlete's head as he was being placed into a stretcher. Doctors did try to revive him, but to no avail."Our first thoughts are with the family, friends, and colleagues of the athlete," Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), told international media. "The whole Olympic family is struck by this tragedy, which clearly casts a shadow over these Games."CEO of the Vancouver organizing committee, John Furlong went on to say: "We are deeply struck by this tragedy, and join the IOC in extending our condolences to the family, friends and teammates of this athlete, who came to Vancouver to follow his Olympic dream."The International Luge Federation (FIL) is now in the process of conducting an internal investigation into the circumstances of what occurred. Training was suspended until officials were able to certify the course as safe. The president of the ILF, Josef Fendt, said in a statement: "This is a terrible accident. This is the gravest thing that can happen in sport, and our thoughts and those of the luge family are naturally with those touched by this event."Mr. Kumaritashvili is the fourth athlete to die in Winter Olympic history.A court in Bavaria, Germany today jailed rail worker Michael Paul for causing a train collision near Bad Aibling in February. The disaster left twelve dead and over 80 wounded.Michael Paul, 40, switched the two trains onto a collision course while distracted by playing the game Dungeon Hunter 5 on his mobile phone. Upon realising his mistake he attempted to avert the accident by contacting drivers directly, but dialled the wrong number. Official investigations ruled out technical faults."I know that I cannot undo what has happened, even if I wish I could," Paul told the court through his lawyers when his trial opened in Traunstein last month. The two commuter trains crashed head-on; the deceased were all males aged 24 to 49. Paul, who admitted negligence and expressed "huge guilt", received a three-and-a-half year sentence. "The accused is guilty of 12 counts of involuntary manslaughter and 85 counts of negligent bodily harm," said presiding judge Erich Fuchs. Paul faced a maximum of five years. Peter Dürr, representing one bereaved family, said sentencing was not his priority. "My mandate is to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again," Dürr said when the trial opened.Up to February, Germany hadn't had a fatal train crash since 2012; their worst was in 1998.German migrant marine rescue charity Sea-Eye on Sunday renamed their ship after Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian child who drowned offshore of Turkey. Relatives of the boy attended the renaming ceremony on the Spanish island of Majorca.Kurdi, his brother, and his mother were among eleven migrants who died in a storm on the Mediterranean Sea in 2015; they had, his surviving father says, paid people smugglers to take them from Turkey to Greece in a small inflatable boat. A photograph of his remains on a Turkish beach drew widespread attention. The accident happened during the height of the European migrant crisis, which saw a large spike in immigration to the continent."This day is very hard for me, as I re-experience many memories," said his father, Abdullah Kurdi, following the ceremony. "It's people with good heart in this organization. So my boy's name stands for something good and his little soul can find ... peace." Abdullah Kurdi now resides in Iraq. The boy's aunt, Tima Kurdi, also attended the ceremony.Sea-Eye spokesperson Carlotta Weibl said "The name 'Alan Kurdi' shall be a reminder of what our work is really about. It is not about ships, captains, NGOs [Non-Governmental Organizations] and clashes with misguided politicians. It is about actual persons, like Alan, [and his brother and mother], who drown in the Mediterranean daily[, and] it is about the endless pain and grief their loved ones have to feel." Sea-Eye credit themselves with around 14,000 lives saved during 60 rescues since commencing work in 2016. Their ship, MV Alan Kurdi, was previously MV Professor Albrecht Penck.Turkey sentenced two people smugglers to four years of prison each for their roles in the events surrounding Kurdi and his fellow migrants' September 2015 deaths. Kurdi's image lead to international public calls for more effort to assist migrants from Syria; since then, anti-immigration groups have increased their numbers and activities in Europe.Investigators looking into the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash in March announced on Wednesday that they had formally identified the 150 passengers who died on the Airbus 320 when it was flown into the French Alps. This will allow for the victims families to prepare for a proper burial ceremony in the coming weeks. It has reportedly taken more than six weeks to match the DNA found at the site of the crash in the French Alps with those of the family members of the victims involved. The city prosecutor of Marseilles, Brice Robin has now said that "The 150 death certificates can now be signed, as well as the 150 burial permits."This comes after extensive investigation into the life of the 27 year old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who had reportedly suffered depression. After locking the cockpit door whilst the pilot was on a toilet break, Lubitz purposely flew the plane into the French Alps. Reports from France's BEA civil aviation investigators revealed that Lubitz had practised altering the flight's data settings during the outbound flight to Barcelona from an altitude of 11,600 metres to an alarmingly low 30 metres.The incident has sparked calls for other international flights to implement the rule of always having two people in the cockpit at all times during flights to prevent any further tragedies such as this. The final report of the investigation is set to be finalised next year.Germanwings Flight 9525, an Airbus A320 carrying 150 passengers and crew, crashed into the French Alps yesterday between Digne and Barcelonnette. Officials said there were no survivors. The plane was flying to Duesseldorf, Germany from Barcelona, Spain. An emergency recovery team made its way to the crash site and reportedly recovered one of the plane's flight recorders.According to French authorities, 144 passengers were aboard the plane, reportedly including sixteen school children who were travelling on a German exchange project. A further six crew were present, including the two pilots. The flight was predominately made up of Spanish and German citizens.The pilots did not send a distress signal. Various officials described the crash as an accident; the White House stated terrorism is not believed to be a factor. The weather reportedly was clear when the crash occurred. The plane descended for eight minutes before impact falling, by various reports, more than 30,000 feet.French President François Hollande said regarding the accident "I would like to send all our solidarity to the family of the victims[...] It's a new air tragedy; we must know all the causes. We are in mourning because this accident happened on our territory". He said he has been in contact with both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and King Felipe VI of Spain, the later of whom cancelled the remainder of his state visit to France.According to French prosecutor Bruce Robin the plane was completely destroyed. He said "The body of the plane is in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage". He made the comments to Reuters news agency describing his view of the crash site from a helicopter.  Germanwings is owned by Lufthansa. CEO of Lufthansa Carsten Spohr said  "We do not yet know what has happened to flight 4U 9525. My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew on 4U 9525. If our fears are confirmed, this is a dark day for Lufthansa. We hope to find survivors."The plane, registered as D-AIPX, had been in service for nearly 25 years. It first flew on November 29, 1990 and had been last checked earlier this month.Sydney, Australia —A 16 year old Sydney student was killed when a 10 metre gum tree fell on the tent in which she was sleeping. Another girl sleeping beside her was unharmed. The accident occurred at 1:30am AEDT at a campsite near Wombeyan Caves. The girl was participating in an overnight leadership camp with Sydney's private Queenwood School for Girls.Severe storms have lashed the east coast of Australia for the past few days.On July 1, 2007 Glasgow International Airport began to reopen after a car was driven into the airport by terrorists, with flights from Orlando and Ibiza arriving during the day. By the end of the day, the airport was reported to be operating largely as usual, but passengers continued to be advised to confirm their flights with operators before coming to the airport. Tight security precautions remain in force across UK airports today, although most flights are operating as normal.Several houses have been searched in the area of Renfrewshire in Neuk Crescent, Houston, Scotland. Five arrests have been made following the incident in Glasgow: two in Glasgow, Scotland, two on the M6 motorway in Cheshire, and one in Liverpool (England). The police are continuing house searches and inquiries throughout the country, including in Merseyside and Staffordshire, with one suspect identified to "still be at large".Sky News reports that two of the arrested men are doctors, working in British hospitals.    A suspicious car has undergone a controlled explosion outside the Royal Alexandra Hospital, to which a suspect of the attack at the airport had been taken for treatment as a result of burns. A 200 m cordon was set up around the hospital as a precautionary measure, with ambulances being turned away from the accident and emergency department. Police have stated that they believe that the suspicious vehicle was connected to the earlier attack at Glasgow International Airport, but that they do not believe it to have contained any explosives.    During a press conference Strathclyde police revealed that they believe the two men had been living in Renfrew for at least six weeks prior to the attacks of yesterday. The green Cherokee jeep is "possibly" a second hand, rather than stolen, car with registration L808 RDT. Questions were raised during the conference concerning whether the USA had, as had been reported in certain circles, published a report predicting that there may be an attack on Glasgow Airport. This was not confirmed and considered as speculation. The police issued an appeal for any details about sightings of the vehicle prior to the event.A ScotRail train travelling from Glasgow to the towns of Oban and Mallaig in Scotland accidentally diverted onto the wrong track tonight. Some passengers initially thought the train had derailed when it swerved and braked hard at Ardlui.Two sets of points at Ardlui railway station had been incorrectly set. The train hit them at 19:50 at sufficient speed to potentially damage them, although the train was able to reverse after they had been inspected. The service was stranded at the station for some time. Although much of the train snaked away from the platform, the rearmost door was still aligned with the platform, allowing passengers including our correspondent to get off and see the situation for themselves. Several passengers photographed and videoed the surreal scene on mobile phones.No other trains were struck in the incident, but the train to Glasgow in the opposite direction was also left waiting at the platform while the situation was resolved. The diverted train ultimately reversed off the points and away from the station, then realigned itself with the platform. It was able to continue with a 30 minute delay.The incident adds to troubles on the West Highland Line this weekend. On Friday a train leaving Oban at midday departed without reservation slips marking seats booked by passengers, and that train was delayed for 40 minutes at Crianlarich, where the train joins with the Mallaig service to form a single train heading to Glasgow.More serious incidents occurred in 2012, when a train heading from Oban to Glasgow struck a landslip caused by heavy rains but did not derail, and in 2010, when a train derailed, caught fire, and was left dangling over a nearby road. Trains travelling both to and from Glasgow struck trees on the line on the same day in 2011, one near Crianlarich and one near Ardlui.The weather satellite GOES-12, which provides most of the weather pictures for the United States, became unusable on Tuesday, December 4.  The satellite is positioned in geostationary orbit over the Amazon.  A normal station-keeping maneuver to adjust its location was not completed as usual and services could not be continued.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates the satellites for its National Weather Service (NWS).  NOAA's satellite division intends to attempt Wednesday night to return GOES-12 to normal mode.  The satellite is in its "safe" mode, which is used to protect it until problems can be identified and repaired.  It is properly oriented toward the Sun so it will have full electrical power for further commands.The GOES-10 satellite, located slightly further east, has been taken from South American coverage and is providing North American service.  GOES-13 is in orbital storage in case it is needed for replacing a failed satellite.Local media reported on Tuesday that a gold mine collapsed in northwestern Tanzania on Sunday, killing at least twenty people. According to reports, the incident occurred at Geita region when the 100-metre-deep shaft the miners were working in collapsed after being flooded by heavy seasonal rains. Some media reports say that thirty people might have been killed by the accident."I know there is no hope of finding anybody alive," said Kelega Chacha, a miner who left the site soon before the mine's collapse. "We will just have to look for the bodies to give them a decent burial."A local newspaper, The African, quoted Donald Mremi, the Geita District Mines Officer, as saying that rescue efforts were hampered due to poor equipment. The African also reported that a dozen of the bodies of the victims have already been identified.Tanzania is the third largest producer of gold in Africa. Much of its output is produced by international firms running large operations. Smaller-scale mines, however, can be quite dangerous, and frequently lack proper safety equipment. Over 45 people were killed in a northern Tanzanian mine in 2008 after the mines they were working it were flooded. In another incident in 2002, a compressor used to provide miners inside the shafts broke down, causing those inside to suffocate.American golfer Tiger Woods has been injured in a car crash near his home in Orlando, Florida. Woods was reported to have been leaving his home around 2:30 a.m. (EST) in his 2009 Cadillac Escalade, when he collided with a fire hydrant and a tree down the street.Woods was taken to Health Central Hospital, and treated for facial lacerations. Early reports described his injuries as "serious", but he was released from a local hospital a short time later, and his publicist, Mark Steinberg, has since described the accident as "minor".  There are also reports that the car's airbags did not deploy, which suggest a low speed collision.  Windemere Mayor Gary Bruhn told CNN, "I think it's nothing more than an accident."Police say alcohol did not play a role in the accident. An investigation is ongoing and reports say that charges could be filed against Woods.A Goodyear blimp crashed at a Coral Springs, Florida industrial park on Thursday night, causing about 1,400 homes to lose power.  The two people on board, pilot Daniel Lynn Thomas and passenger Charles Thomas, were not hurt, although they were trapped on board briefly while electrical crews cleared the area.The blimp, named the "Stars and Stripes" is 192 feet long, 59.5 feet tall, and 50 feet wide.  It took off from Goodyear's 32 acre blimp base at Pompano Beach Air Park, about 12 miles away, shortly before the crash.  It is one of three Goodyear Blimps in the United States.The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the cause of the crash, thought to be weather related. Goodyear company spokesman Jerry Jenkins, in a brief statement on Thursday, said, "We're grateful there were no injuries onboard or on the ground. Following an investigation, more information will be released.""Stars and Stripes" was the oldest of the three operational Goodyear blimps and was best known for providing aerial coverage of NASCAR races.The government of the Bahamas has issued a hurricane warning for the Central Bahamas, the Southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands.As of 17:30 UTC today the Hurricane is moving towards the west-southwest at a speed of 7 km/h and it is expected to hit the central and southeastern Bahamas during the next two days. According to the National Hurricane Service the maximum sustained wind speed of the hurricane will be 120 km/h.The hurricane is expected to produce up to twenty centimeters of rainfall over the affected areas of the Bahamas. Forecasters have also predicted that the hurricane my strike the United States.  "Right now, the uncertainty is such that it could hit anywhere from Miami to the outer banks of North Carolina," commented Jessica Schauer Clark, a spokesperson National Hurricane Center. "So people really need to keep an eye on it."Overnight rain following rain earlier in the week has caused the grounds at Sunshine Coast Grammar School to flood. The school has been closed and any students who showed up were sent home.There is the possibility that senior classes will not go ahead tomorrow, as much of the lower floor of the resource center has been flooded.				The school was closed early and staff sent home due to workplace health and safety issues and the lack of accessibility to other parts of the Sunshine Coast.No major incidents have been reported, although one car was caught in a creek at the school, the driver having not seen the edge of the road due to the creek running quickly over it. It was towed out safely.A grandfather and his grandson have died off the coast of North Wales, UK, after their sailing dinghy was overwhelmed and capsized in rough seas. They were with a party of four who had been angling from a 4.6 m boat.At 4pm local time on Saturday the Holyhead Coastguard received an emergency call from the Star Reader saying they had found a capsized dinghy adrift three and a half miles north of Puffin Island, off the east coast of the Isle of Anglesey.A third vessel, the Sara Jane, also attended the scene to allow a first aider on board to render assistance.A RAF search and rescue helicopter was scrambled and the Beaumaris lifeboat launched to effect a rescue effort. Two people were found clinging to the boat but two more had been washed away. A rapid search recovered both of them.The rescue helicopter lowered its winchman onto the dinghy to begin CPR on the nine year old boy before he was winched onboard. He was flown to nearby Bangor Hospital, but later died.The Beaumaris lifeboat raced the grandfather - also suffering serious hypothermia - ashore to a waiting ambulance, but he too died shortly afterwards. The lifeboat also carried an uninjured member of the party ashore, while the helicopter returned to rescue a second young boy.The father and a twelve year old boy survived. All had been wearing life jackets, but the sea was running at 1.5 m waves in a 45 km/h wind at the time. It is believed the two dead had been in the water for at least three hours before they were recovered, and died from the effects of hypothermia.In the U.S. state of Texas, grass fires spread across 2,000 acres of land, destroying at least two dozen structures in the process. The fires were fueled by gusty winds of up to 60 miles per hour.No injuries or deaths have been reported. Residential areas in Tarrant, Wise, Parker, Nolan, Burnet, and Callahan counties were evacuated as firefighters struggled to put out the flames. Fires were also reported in Dallas, Denton, and Collin counties. Many of these fires have now been contained, officials say.In response to the fires, Texas governor Rick Perry activated the state's Emergency Operations Center at the highest level. In addition, 152 counties instituted burn bans.Military aircraft were sent to the area to help douse the fires. According to officials, two CH-47 Chinook helicopters are on standby in Grand Prairie, waiting for the winds to slow down before taking to the skies with buckets of water. Six UH60 Blackhawk helicopters are on standby in Austin and San Antonio as well.Sharolyn Holder, a North Texas resident, said, "My house is sitting back there with fire all around it. My son's house has already burned some. It's just so stressful."Craig Civale of WFAA-TV said that a lack of water contributed to the spread of the fires. "We've seen areas where fire trucks simply ran out of water, tanker trucks ran out of water, and had to stop battling the blazes at these homes; and pretty much watch them burn down until more water came to the area," he said.Officials in Tarrant County believe that a fire in Benbrook may have been started by a cigarette thrown onto an interstate highway.Parts of U.S. Route 377 and Interstate 35 were closed due to the fires.The heavy winds had other adverse effects for Texas residents. Around 75,000 homes in the area were reported to be without power in the afternoon due to the wind knocking down several power lines.Some flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were delayed more than half an hour or cancelled after the wind forced officials to limit use of the runways.United States hard rock band Great White has filed a settlement offer of US$1 million to families of victims of the Station nightclub fire. 100 people died including band guitarist Ty Longley and over 200 were injured in the February 2003 disaster in Rhode Island.The fire started when band manager Daniel Bichele ignited pyrotechnics towards the beginning of a concert by Great White at the club. Cheap packing foam had been used as soundproofing material to surround the stage, and this ignited. Great White were never charged, but Bichele was given a 15-year sentence with 11 of those suspended in 2006 for 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter, to which he pleaded guilty. He was paroled in March this year.The settlement offer would need to be approved by each of the over 300 plaintiffs, as well as the federal judge. It would add to $175 million already offered by dozens of defendants in the case. No money has been handed out to any of the claimants as yet, and a law professor from Duke University has been hired to develop a formula that will determine how much each party is entitled to.The fire was the fourth-deadliest nightclub fire in US history.Greece has declined Finland's offer of three firefighting helicopters and 25 firefighters.The offer had been made as a result of a request by Greece for aid with the forest fires Greece is currently experiencing. Greece had stressed at the time that the most urgent need was for fixed-wing aircraft with water-bombing capabilities, assets Finland does not possess.The Greek authorities said that the equipment Finland had offered was not suited to the task it had been proposed for. Ole Norrback, current Finnish ambassador to Greece, has already said that Finland is in a better position to aid with reforestation efforts once the fires have been quenched.Fires continue to burn in Greece on Monday destroying everything in their path. Death toll has exceeded 60 with daily Greek newspapers Kathimerini and Ta Nea reporting 61 and 63 deaths respectively. Ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Olympics, was also threatened but firefighters kept the site safe. The new museum of Olympia was saved in the last minute but part of the ancient stadium was not spared. The Greek Government has offered a €1 million reward for anyone providing information which leads to the arrest of an arsonist. A Greek government statement read: "The reward is set between 100,000 and 1m euros for every [act] of arson, depending on whether death or serious injury occurred and the size of the damage."Thousands of people in Greece have been forced to evacuate their homes after major wildfires continued for their third day in the suburbs outside of Athens.10,000 people were evacuated out of one town, Agios Stefanos, located 23 kilometres from downtown Athens, after the flames headed for the area. All residents were ordered to take the main highway to Athens.The deputy mayor of the town, Panayiotis Bitakos, told Skai TV that "I call on all residents to follow the instructions of the police as to where they will go. We had been begging the authorities since early in the morning to send forces [...] It is too late now. Too late."Athens Prefect Yannis Sgouras told state NET TV that strong winds helped strengthen the fires, and caused extra difficulties for the firefighters trying to put out the blaze. He said that approximately 120 square kilometres have been burned so far."More than 120,000 stremmas [30,000 acres] have been burnt. It is an ecological disaster," he said.In a televised speech on NET, the fire department spokesman Ioannis Kapakis stated that "the strength of the winds has increased and the situation remains particularly difficult.”In total, 83 major fires were reported across Greece from 06.00 yesterday to 18.00 today.No casualties have yet been reported, and no official property damage tally has yet been made, although Greek media have estimated tens of homes to have been damaged.The fires are the worst in Greece since 2007, when heavy wildfires killed 77 people.Greece's socialist opposition party leader, George Papandreou has stepped up its attack on the government's response to the most devastating wildfires in the country's history, with 64 dead and thousands homeless.Papandreou pointed that the government had been "totally incompetent" in fighting the blazes that continued to rage across southern Greece after five days. The PASOK president said that "This government was proven to be totally incompetent, unable to handle the fire crisis, like all the other crises it encountered in its four-year administration," while he met with Greek President Karolos Papoulias at the presidential mansion in Athens earlier today.Protesters have marched through Athens chanting "down with the government" after Greek television showed householders trying to fight the flames with hoses and buckets, fueling claims that the governmental response had been poorly coordinated. Another protest is going to take place tomorrow in Thessaloniki and other cities throughout Greece.The prime minister, Kostas Karamanlis, said on Saturday it could not be coincidence that so many fires broke out simultaneously in so many areas of the country. Papandreou attacking the government, denounced the claims as baseless conspiracy theories, although across the political spectrum there was agreement that arson may have been involved.A report published by Greenpeace questions an estimate made by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that 4000 deaths have resulted from the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Greenpeace claims that this estimate is 'a gross simplification of the breadth of human suffering' and that over the last 15 years, 60,000 have died in Russia because of the accident, and estimates that the total death toll for Ukraine and Belarus could be another 140,000.The figure of 4,000 deaths given by the IAEA report referred to cancer fatalities within a group of 600,000 people, comprising of those who were sent in to clean up after the accident and those relocated after the accident. The Greenpeace report calls this figure 'misleading', saying that the report 'hid the true scale of human impact of Chernobyl'.Ivan Blokov of Greenpeace said "it is appalling that the IAEA is whitewashing the impacts of the most serious nuclear accident in human history".The IAEA have not yet responded to the report. The World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Gregory Hartl stated that "The Greenpeace report is looking at all of Europe, whereas our report looks at only the most affected areas of the three most affected countries." Furthermore, "The WHO felt it had recourse to the best national and international scientific evidence and studies when it came up with its estimates of [up to] 9,000 excess deaths for the most affected areas. We feel they're very sound."The report has been released at a time when the UK government is considering whether new nuclear power stations should be built in the country.A woman set off a hand grenade outside the Tajikistan Ministry of Emergencies, killing herself.The incident, which happened on October 9, has not been claimed by any groups. It is unknown whether the attack, and two similar happenings earlier this year, were by a terrorist group. Some Western diplomats suggest the first two bombs were linked to business disputes or political vendettas.The woman died in an ambulance, en route to the hospital. The grenade was hidden in her handbag.A metal guard rail slicing into a bus killed ten people today in an overnight crash in Ipoh, Malaysia. Three more were injured with one hospitalised when the double-decker Sani Express struck the rail at 1 a.m. this morning with 48 passengers on board.The vehicle was en route to the northern destination of Perlis from the central state of Selangor when it crashed in Perak on the North-South Expressway, which runs the length of the country. The victims were on the lower deck when the vehicle skidded, struck and was ripped open on the left-hand side by the rail before swerving across the road to rest against the central divider. Of the ten killed, the youngest was fourteen and the oldest 64. The victim hospitalised has four broken ribs.The bus driver had prior traffic offense convictions, although the bus had not been in any incidents with the police. Police arrested him, noting he was not drunk or on drugs, and he has been remanded in custody until Wednesday. He admits that he fell asleep just before the crash. Press photographs showed the left side of the bus had been torn open along the bottom of the lower deck for most of its length, and bodies covered with newspaper lying in front of the vehicle.Perak saw another major bus crash two years ago on the same highway. 22 people were killed in that crash, which remains the nation's worst bus accident.An overcrowded double decker bus in Guatemala crashed into a gulley Friday, killing 57 people and injuring 40 more, authorities say.The bus crashed about 30 miles from Guatemala City while carrying roughly 100 people towards San Salvador.Journalist Martin Austurias says that a makeshift morgue was created along the highway so that relatives of the passengers could identify the victims.Austurias noted that several policemen and firefighters were working to uncover bodies from the wreckage.Vinicio Gómez, the Guatemalan Interior Minister and Édgar Hernández Umaña, the deputy Interior Minister, were yesterday killed in a helicopter crash, according to government officials. The helicopter lost contact at 19:08 UTC yesterday, and as a result, this is believed to be the time that the accident occurred.A spokesperson for the Guatemalan government said that the accident was caused by bad weather. They also stated, one their official website, that the incident occurred at a point 42 miles away from La Aurora International Airport, the country's major international airport.A spokesperson for the Guatemalan government highlighted the official response to the events. "The government is distraught and regrets the death of a key minister, who had done good work in a few months in office," he said."The Mexican government is already lending its support. It has put a plane at the president's disposal to take him from Villahermosa to Guatemala tomorrow," continued Fernando Barrillas, the spokesperson.Aníbal Archila, a Guatemalan reporter for Notisiete, was killed Thursday night as he was reporting on the eruption of the Pacaya volcano.  Firefighters and another journalist found his body near Cerro Chino. Two more bodies were found near Cerro, both in the path of a lava flow. Archila, 32, had worked twelve years as a journalist.Fellow worker Vinicio Fuentes said that Archila couldn't escape from the rain of volcanic stones, but his cameraman and another group of local reporters could. Archila was found with several lava and rock injuries on his body.President Álvaro Colom and many other Guatemalan officials attended Archila's wake at a local chapel. Archila's body was taken at 08:30 (14:30 UTC) to the Metropolitan Cathedral for a mass. Later, it was moved to Notisiete's headquarters, where a memorial took place.  Internment will take place at the Hermano Pedro cemetery in Mixco. The volcano began erupting on Thursday, and on Friday searches began for another three people who are missing. Colom has placed Guatemala City and the Escuintla region under a state of emergency. About 1,600 people have been evacuated from the region, and La Aurora International Airport has been closed.After an explosion aboard an oil rig four days ago, an oil spill caused by the sinking of the rig has expanded to cover an area of around 600 square miles (1550 square kilometers), and efforts to shut off the leak have thus far been unsuccessful.Officials have begun to use robotic submersible vehicles to stop the leak. The efforts began yesterday, although it could be as late as tomorrow before they are completed. The vehicles will attempt to engage a device called a blowout preventer, which can seal the well shut to prevent sudden releases of pressure within the well, like the one that may have caused the rig to explode. According to BP, the company that operated the well, the attempt was the first of its kind in the world.The leaks are on a pipe from the ocean floor called a riser. They are currently estimated to be releasing around 42,000 gallons of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, and the oil slick on the surface of the ocean is estimated to cover an area about 48 by 39 miles at its widest points. Officials say oil is not expected to reach land until at least Thursday, and would remain at least 30 miles from land through Tuesday. The impact of the spill on wildlife is currently unknown; there have been no reports of animal casualties, though whales were seen in the vicinity of the spill yesterday.According to officials, there are two other possible ways to contain the oil spill if the attempt to seal the well is unsuccessful. One option would be to install a large dome over the leak and send the collected oil to the surface, where it would be collected by ships. This has been done before, although only in shallow water. The second option is to drill an entirely new well that would intersect the original, although this could take months to complete.According to local police, James Von Brunn, an 88-year-old man armed with a rifle has shot and killed guard Stephen Tyrone Johns, and been wounded himself, in the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon.The incident occurred slightly after 1:00 p.m. (EDT) (17:00 UTC). Preliminary reports say that the man entered the building and opened fire, firing five or six rounds before being shot down by other security guards in the building.Roads next to the museum were shut down after the shooting happened.The gunman had links to white supremacists, police say."I heard a shot and though it was sort of a loud, like someone had dropped something," said an eyewitness, Angela Andelson, to the Agence France-Presse news agency. "And I see all these security guards kind of like ducking. I kind of glanced again and saw a gunman coming in [...] a long-looking kind of gun. I just ran in to one of the exhibits to try to take cover. I heard the first one. When I turned and looked there were maybe two to four more shots that I heard. People were screaming and ducking down getting on the floor, getting under benches."On Saturday morning, a gunman shot shoppers at a Walmart store in the U.S. border city of El Paso, Texas, with the death toll rising to 22 people on Monday, reported officials, with 25 others injured. Police said the suspected gunman surrendered himself to police after being confronted by officers.  The shooting began at 10:39 a.m. local time (1639 UTC), according to police, who said officers arrived at the Walmart six minutes later.State prosecutors charged the suspect in the shooting with capital murder, they said Sunday — murder carrying the possibility of the death penalty. Federal authorities are investigating the shooting as domestic terrorism, according to prosecutor Josh Bash, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas. Bash characterized the attack as "designed to intimidate a civilian population, to say the least.""We are treating it as a domestic terrorism case, and we're going to do what we do to terrorists in this country, which is deliver swift and certain justice," said Bash. Charges of domestic terrorism also carry a possible death penalty at the federal level.The Walmart, by the Cielo Vista Mall, where the shooting happened is roughly five miles (eight kilometers) from the U.S.–Mexico border crossing between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, separated by the Rio Grande.According to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, six Mexican nationals were killed in the attack, and seven more were injured.  Another report from the Mexican government during the weekend said eight Mexicans died in the attack.  Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said the Mexican government would pressure the U.S. government to provide better protections for Mexicans in the United States.The foreign minister said Mexico would consider charging the gunman with terrorism against Mexicans and would seek to extradite the gunman to face charges in Mexico. Ebrard said, "As far as I know, this would be the first case of this type in history", adding, "For Mexico, this individual is a terrorist".U.S. officials identified the suspect as 21-year-old Patrick Crusius of Allen, Texas, near the city of Dallas.According to the El Paso mayor, Dee Margo, during the weekend, police were investigating whether a manifesto posted online to the message board 8chan was written by the suspect. In the document, the writer supposes a "cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion" of Hispanic people into the United States.According to U.S. Attorney Bash, the manifesto if written by the suspect could strengthen the federal government's case: "The key factor here is that it appears to be an intent to coerce or intimidate a civilian population[...] That's met here."El Paso's police chief Greg Allen said late Sunday the police were attributing authorship of the document to Crusius.According to data from the Gun Violence Archive, the shooting followed four deadly mass shootings in the United States that week, including one in California at a garlic festival in Gilroy, killing three, and another in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin where at least five died. The El Paso shooting preceded another one less than thirteen hours later in Dayton, Ohio where ten people died. The archive characterizes events where four or more people are killed or injured by gunfire, other than the perpetrator, as a mass shooting.According to police reports, at least ten people have been killed by militant gunmen in a mosque in the Cho-ai-rong district of the Narathiwat province in southern Thailand on Monday. Nineteen other people were wounded in the attack, thirteen of them critically.Five or six gunmen, armed with assault rifles, came into the mosque during evening prayers and opened fire. "They opened fire indiscriminately at about 50 worshipers inside the mosque," said a police official to the Agence France-Presse news agency.The incident is one of the most deadly attacks in the country ever since a separatist Islamic insurgency was created in southern Thailand in 2004. Since then, over 3,400 people have been killed in violence.Countries and relief organisations around the world are sending aid to Haiti, which was hit by a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on Tuesday, affecting up to three million people, most of them in the capital, Port-au-Prince. Relief efforts, however, have been hampered by damaged or destroyed infrastructure, lack of shelter, and communications difficulties.As of today, at least 300,000 people were estimated to be homeless in the capital, according to the United Nations; the organisation reports that one in ten buildings completely collapsed due to the tremors and resulting aftershocks. The UN said it believes 45,000 to 50,000 people were killed by the quake, while Haitian President Rene Preval said that seven thousand bodies were buried in a mass grave.Port-au-Prince's main airport remained open as of today, and relief airplanes were arriving faster than they could be unloaded, prompting fears that planes could run out of fuel while waiting their turn to land. As a result, all non-military flights out of the airport were restricted. Air traffic controllers from the US were present to help handle the flow.The main port, meanwhile, was severely damaged, and unable to handle any cargo.To see more images related to the disaster, you may wish to look at the companion article Haitian earthquake: in pictures.The survivors from the recent 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti are now facing increasing insecurity from human traffickers and convicts escaped from collapsed prisons, officials have cautioned, even as aid is flowing into the country. The acting head of the UN's Haitian mission, meanwhile, says that that full reconstruction could take several decades. As many as 200,000 people were killed by the tremors, which struck on January 12, and 1.5 million people have been left without homes.Anthony Banbury, the deputy head of the UN mission in the earthquake-ravaged country, commented to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency that survivors queuing for aid sometimes turned violent. He commented that while the aid is vital for the country, "it can be a source of insecurity because it attracts big crowds and there can be disorder around food distribution.""[It is] absolutely necessary that we get enough food, enough water, enough shelter for the people, and enough security. I don't think any of us are anywhere near being close to being satisfied, because so much more needs to be done," he added. "[We must] do things smart, as well as fast, and that's a big challenge for us now."The Haitian national police chief, Mario Andresol, remarked that electricity blackouts resulted in "bandits [...] taking advantage to harass and rape women and young girls under the tents," adding that 7,000 inmates of prisons escaped after the quake. "It took us five years to apprehend them. Today they are running wild."Further exacerbating the security situation was that the Haitian police force was largely crippled by the disaster, with hundreds of policemen either killed or missing."At night, people take things. But I don't have a problem. I don't have anything to steal." said one local resident, Omen Cola, to AFP.Child trafficking, meanwhile, is also an issue; it had been a chronic problem even before the earthquake. The Red Cross has started to register orphaned children, and temporarily sending some to orphanages for shelter, according to a senior advisor for the United Nations Children's Fund  (UNICEF), Bo Viktor Nylund.UNICEF press official Roshan Khadivi told the Xinhua news agency on Wednesday that "we are taking photos and filling in forms to get the children's full details on file. Experience has shown us that there is at least one family member left usually. UNICEF does not believe in institutionalization in orphanages. Children need to be connected with their communities." Khadivi noted that considering adoption would only be done if the child's parents are not found after several months.Sixty orphaned children, meanwhile, were transported earlier by plane to Germany, where they are to be adopted; six of them were hospitalised for fatigue and dehydration.Haiti was hit by a heavy earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 on Tuesday, killing an unknown number of people, and destroying up to ten percent of buildings in the capital, Port-au-Prince.No official death toll has been released as of yet, although the United Nations says that up to fifty thousand people may potentially have been killed. An estimated 300,000 more were left without homes.In a special photo report, Wikinews looks at the extensive damage caused by the disaster.To find more information about a certain image or to enlarge it, click it. For an in-depth textual report on the same subject, please see Haiti relief efforts: in depth.A Haitian shipwreck occurring Sunday night or Monday afternoon took the lives of at least 15 poverty stricken migrants seeking America when waves tore the handmade wooden sailboat to shreds on the coral reefs off the Turks and Caicos Islands.  Of the 200 on the overloaded vessel, about 70 are still missing and 122 have been rescued.  "The boat ran aground on a reef, Molasses Reef, off West Caicos.  We have a total of 15 dead bodies now. They are illegal immigrants," said Calvin Chase, Turks and Caicos police Sergeant.Haitian survivors reported that after they had been sailing about three days they had spotted police boats in the area and turned towards the dangerous reefs.The U.S. Coast Guard were alerted Monday to the situation and offered aircraft and ships to supplement Turks and Caicos search and rescue personnel.The injured are being treated in Caribbean hospitals.  The rescue operation was hampered by 23 mph winds and sea waves cresting up to 6 feet (1.8 m) high.The survivors will be repatriated back to Haiti.Last week over 100 Haitian migrants were rescued from an overloaded ship near the same area and repatriated to Haiti, and in May a capsized boat killed as many as nine illegal immigrants."Unfortunately many people lose their lives trying to reach the United States illegally, anywhere of 100 or more per year. They don't have enough life-saving gear or signaling gear to ensure that they are able to survive if they do have any problems at sea," said Lt Cdr Matthew Moorlag of the US Coast Guard.Haitian families will spend their savings to pay brokers up to $500 for a spot on these overcrowded boats.  The illegal immigrants often traveling with little food and water hope for employment in the United States, the Bahamas or in the Turks and Caicos Islands.In May of 2007 a similar tragedy occurred when an overcrowded people smuggling ship capsized carrying 160 aboard.  Survivors reported fellow passengers being eaten by sharks.The Haitian government Communications Minister states that over 150,000 people in Port-au-Prince, the country's capital, are confirmed dead from the recent magnitude 7.0 earthquake there.Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue commented that the figure is based on corpses found and collected in the city by a state company, CNE."Nobody knows how many bodies are buried in the rubble — 200,000, 300,000?  Who knows the overall death toll?" the Associated Press reports Lassegue as commenting.Yesterday, the United Nations reported the Haitian government found 111,481 bodies recovered from rubble. Meanwhile, at least 75,000 corpses have been buried in mass graves. The government officially announced on Saturday that its search for survivors buried beneath buildings had ended; the focus is now on getting aid to survivors.The European Union presidency says that air traffic over Europe could return to about 50 percent of its normal level on Monday, if weather forecasts confirm that skies over the continent are clearing of volcanic ash.  European transportation ministers from countries affected by the ash from the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland began spewing into the sky last week will meet on Monday by video conference in an effort to reopen closed airspace.The volcanic ash has brought chaos to the region — canceling most trans-Atlantic and European flights and leaving thousands of airline passengers stranded for days, as well as disrupting commerce.European Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas says Europe has never experienced a transportation disruption like this and that officials need to take action to get things moving again. "This is clear also, that this is not sustainable. So we cannot go ahead and just wait until the ash cloud will disappear," he said.Kallas says Monday's meeting will try to find a technological solution to the flight disruption, but he stressed that safety considerations will come first. "It is clear that safety is our first and utmost priority, so we cannot compromise with safety. But we are working based on new evidence about test flights, how to assess the situation and how to find solutions to increase air space without compromising safety," he said.Spanish Secretary of State for E.U. Affairs Diego López Garrido says the ash cloud over Europe is moving to the northeast, which could clear half of the air space over the continent. "Probably there will be half of the European Union territory influenced by this ash cloud. And from this perspective, the forecast is that there will be half of the flights possibly operating in Europe," he said.But the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands say their airspace will remain closed for much of Monday.  However, Air travel in Southern Europe — including Spain, southern Italy, Greece, and Turkey — remains open.Meteorologists say conditions over Europe were unstable on Sunday and that shifting winds made air travel dangerous. They also note that the irregular eruptions from the Icelandic volcano, which continues to spew ash into the sky, is adding to the unpredictability of the situation.One expert, Guy Gratton, who is head of the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements at Cranfield University in the UK, took a flight on Thursday and noted "It's still quite a complex mixture of clear air and very worrying but invisible volcanic ash at all sorts of heights."Some of his colleagues made a flight on Sunday and noticed in certain locations, "quite high concentrations of ash." Gratton added, "I suspect it's going to be a few days yet before it's safe to fly." Volcanic ash consists of rock, glass and other particles that can stall aircraft engines.  KLM said it flew four planes in a normal pattern above 3,000 meters from Amsterdam to Dusseldorf on Sunday. The airline's pilots said they did not encounter residue from the ash cloud and that jetliners were not damaged. Lufthansa flew 10 empty planes from Frankfurt to Munich on Saturday without incident, and Air France flew several successful test flights. British Airways also flew a test flight.Some aviation officials have criticized the airline shutdowns, arguing that they were based solely on computer models. Air Berlin chief Joachim Hunold was quoted on Sunday by German media as saying that no one has yet sent weather balloons into the atmosphere to collect data on the volcanic ash.Analysts say airlines are losing about $200 million a day because of the European and trans-Atlantic shutdowns.The last major disruption to European aviation followed the September 11 attacks on the United States almost a decade ago. U.S. airspace was closed for three days and European airlines canceled all trans-Atlantic flights.Meanwhile, the British government is considering the possibility of sending in the Royal Navy to help ferry the stranded. Currently, officials are seeing what military and commercial vessels are possibly available to be deployed.The volcano, Eyjafjallajökull, in southeastern Iceland began erupting on Wednesday, for the second time in a month, after being dormant for nearly 200 years.Sunday saw Formula One racer Lewis Hamilton win the Bahrain Grand Prix after an "incredible" race he spent battling with teammate Nico Rosberg. It was F1's 900th ever World Championship Grand Prix.The two Mercedes drivers were neck-and-neck throughout the race, with Hamilton usually in front. Rosberg started from pole position after Hamilton made a mistake in qualifying, going off-track and settling for second. After the race Hamilton said it was "an incredible day, a really tough day" and he wanted some relaxation time.Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo had to start from thirteenth despite qualifying third after an incident in Malaysia last race saw him given a ten-place grid penalty. His car left the pits with a wheel loose, and stewards imposed the penalty after deeming it unacceptably dangerous. Ricciardo managed to finish fourth to score his first points of the season after a disqualification in the opening race in his native Australia.Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel continued to struggle with technical problems, including his drag reduction system and gearbox. Starting from tenth ahead of teammate Ricciardo, he was able to reach sixth by the finish line. He missed much of the final practice session before qualifying after he spun off the track and beached his car. The closure of the night race was marked with a fireworks display.Venezuelan driver Pastor Maldonado also saw his troubles continue. Having newly switched to Lotus, he failed to complete the opening two races this year and damaged his car with an accidental wheelie practicing for this one. Exiting the pit lane on the 41st lap Maldonado struck the side of Sauber racer Esteban Gutiérrez with sufficient force to send the Mexican's car onto its back before rolling back upright.Gutiérrez received medical attention on-site and in hospital as a precaution, but was uninjured. "Wow!" Gutiérrez told his team via radio before leaving the car. "What was that?"  Maldonado received a stop-and-go penalty  and finished outside the points. Stewards had further punishment for the Lotus driver after the race. He will have a five-place grid position penalty at the start of his race in China. He also had three points added to his racing driver's licence, a new system this year comparable to a normal motorist receiving points after traffic offences.Maldonado seemed to imply the other driver played a roll in the collision. "We will need to have a look again at what happened," he said, "as Esteban seemed to be off his line coming into turn one — maybe he missed his braking point, I don't know — and by then I was in the corner with nowhere to go". Fan opinion is sharply against him, with some using the derogatory nickname Crashtor Maldonado. Others said his punishment was unfair compared to Ricciardo's ten-place grid position drop after his team's mistake in Malaysia.  Gutiérrez thanked supportive fans via social media after the race in English and Mexican, and returned to the circuit yesterday as teams took to testing. Maldonado was not alone in causing accidents. Jules Bianchi received a drive-through penalty  after colliding with Adrian Sutil, leaving both cars sporting punctures. Sutil later retired from the race.Other retirements included Marcus Ericsson and Kevin Magnussen, both rookies, who separately pulled up at the trackside. Fellow newcomer Daniil Kvyat of Russia, who claimed the title of F1's youngest-ever points scorer at the season opener, was placed just outside the points despite setting one of the fastest laps of the early part of the race. He had also scored in Malaysia."Not an easy race for us yesterday!" Kvyat tweeted on Monday. "But many things learned, and helpful for the future."The podium was rounded out by Sergio Pérez in third, claiming Force India's second-ever podium finish off the back of a failure to even start in Malaysia with a gearbox malfunction. Nico Hulkenberg took fifth. Both he and ninth-place Fernando Alonso celebrated upon completing the race, arms in the air. Williams racers Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas scored seventh and eight place respectively. Kimi Räikkönen claimed the final scoring position of tenth despite a minor collision with Magnussen at the race start.Williams, who this year are using new bright white livery on their cars, where able to keep the coloured stripes of sponsor Martini. Constraints from the host nation meant the word Martini itself, however, was changed to 'racing' on the cars. Williams test driver Susie Wolff of Scotland  started a competition during the race weekend to win one of her Martini-coloured caps for submitting pictures of designs using the Martini colours.A further near miss was suffered by Bottas when he ran off-track after becoming caught in battling between Räikkönen and Ricciardo. His team radioed to promise a complaint would be made to race director Charlie Whiting.Rosberg told his Twitter followers "Great fight with @LewisHamilton but I'm back in two weeks to take the win". Hamilton tweeted "What a race! Amazing to get my first win in Bahrain" and also paid tribute to his Mercedes team.Anti-government protestors turned out in their thousands at the start of the race weekend. The peaceful rally at the capital, Manama, was marred by small groups throwing molotov cocktails  at police. The protestors were opposed to the international attraction giving patronage to Bahrain. Events at the circuit were given heavy security.The race has been the target of intense protesting for several years.A Royal Navy pilot has safely ejected from his Harrier GR7 aircraft moments before it crashed in a field near the small village of Ashwell in the county of Rutland in England. The crash occurred at about 1350 BST today. The pilot was taken by air ambulance to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham for treatment for spinal injuries. Local resident Vic Harrison spoke to the BBC about the incident: "I thought he didn't stand a chance, but I looked up and saw the parachute of the pilot. I really thought he had hit the houses. It was a narrow miss - it must have been just 400 yards from our house. It has been an exceptionally lucky escape."The plane, from the nearby RAF Cottesmore airbase, was on a training mission and is said not to have been carrying any weapons.On Thursday morning, before dawn, Hawaii's Kīlauea shield volcano erupted again, sending up an ash plume to an altitude of 30,000 feet (9,100 meters).  This follows an earlier eruption Tuesday afternoon, after which authorities issued an aviation alert and to extend an ash-fall advisory for residents.  The current eruption event began May 3 and has caused thousands of people to evacuate their homes.Robert Hughes, whose Aloha Junction Bed and Breakfast, is only 1.5 miles from the volcano's crater described the day as otherwise "a nice rainy day" and reportedly some nearby residents slept through the 4:00AM local time eruption (1400 UTC).Hawaii is one of the United States and an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. Kīlauea is located on the island of Hawaii, generally called the "Big Island." The 2018 eruptions at Kīlauea first started on May 3. Since then, about 20 fissure vents have opened, cracking concrete and giving off steam, lava and toxic gases.The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) issued a "notice for aviation" to alert pilots of dangerous conditions. "We're observing more or less continuous emission of ash now with intermittent, more energetic ash bursts or plumes," said Steve Brantley of the HVO. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) also issued a "red alert" which means "major volcanic activity is imminent, underway or suspected with hazardous conditions both on the ground and in the air." The National Weather Service extended its advisory about ash-fall as winds spread the ash and cause elevated risk of respiratory problems for residents. By mid-morning on Thursday, the warning ran until midday (12:00 local, 2200 UTC).Monday, authorities reported fissures throwing lava and boulders as far as 500 feet (about 150 meters).  The volcanic eruption has  destroyed dozens of buildings, and necessitated the evacuation of more than 2000 people.The initial eruption was accompanied by a magnitude-6.9 earthquake and followed by many smaller quakes thereafter. Dozens of homes and other buildings, as well as roads, have been destroyed. However, the Hawaii Civil Defense Agency sought to calm public worries about a tsunami on Tuesday, stating: "according to the [HVO] there is no geologic evidence for an tsunami-generating earthquake at this time. Any such event is extremely unlikely."The lava released so far has been slow and relatively cool, left over from an earlier event in the 1950s, but there were concerns that fresh, fast-moving lava may be right behind. Although the current eruption event began May 3, technically the volcano hasn't stopped erupting since 1983.On March 14, 2006, the Ka Loko Reservoir on the Hawaiian island of Kauai gave way around 5 a.m. after several days of torrential rains and thunder. The resulting wave destroyed coastal highways, killed one person, and left seven others missing. The missing and dead count is expected to increase as searchers investigate the waters that flowed into the Pacific. Even though Kauai had received 5-6 inches of rain in the past day, most residents admitted that the island was not prepared for this situation. Although oil was spilled into the water, there has been no sighting of significant damage.This dam break has many concerned about the possibility of another reservoir break, especially since most of Hawaii's reservoirs are at least a century old and privately owned. Engineers have begun to drain both the Morita and Waita Reservoirs, also on Kauai, to prevent any possible breaks. Although the governor stated that most of the responsibility for privately owned reservoirs belongs to the owners, she did admit that the state was also failing in its monitoring responsibilities, noting that the department in charge of monitoring reservoirs only has two employees. Although the primary owner, the Mary N. Lucas Trust, has made no comment, a partial owner, Mr. Jimmy Pflueger, has admitted he was devastated by the damage done by the reservoir.The dam, 40 feet high and 80 feet long, released 300-400 million gallons of water, about 1400 acre-ft. Many tourists, as well as native residents, have been stranded without transportation, as the destruction of the main Lihue highway, the Kuhio Highway, has closed down the airport. The Coast Guard has taken over the main part of the search, although Hawaii National Guards has also been activated. Kauai County's mayor has declared Kauai to be in a state of emergency.The Space Shuttle Atlantis has received at least a 4 inch tear on its Thermal Protection System (TPS) on one of the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods near the thrusters after it took off on June 8, but officials say the damage is not concerning yet, and the OMS was not damaged."There's not a whole lot of concerns just yet," said a spokesman for NASA, Louis Parker."Preliminary Area of Interest in TPS inspection: Around a 4 inch blanket reported sticking out at the port OMS pod. Crew reported that on the port OMS pod they can see a 4 to 5 inch piece of blanket sticking up. They are getting photos," said NASA.The OMS is used to control the shuttle's movement in space and is also used for orbital injection and NASA says that preliminary imaging shows that the OMS was not damaged."Analysis by launch team looking at other camera views show that the tyvek cover did not strike the OMS pod," said NASA.Astronauts inspected the shuttle for more damage at approximately 2:00 p.m. (eastern time) using Atlantis's robotic arm with digital cameras placed on the end, but found none and Atlantis is still planned to dock with the International Space Station.Over 2,000 cattle died throughout eight counties in Nebraska last week as a result of an unexpected heat wave. Officials estimate that number could grow as other counties report in. According to Tim Reimer of the United States Farm Service Agency, cattle nearing slaughter are difficult to keep cool due to their large size, and thus more vulnerable to heat. The animals are provided large quantities of water, but they sometimes stop drinking under the effects of the high temperatures. The deaths worsened the situation for farmers, who were already struggling with high feed costs. "There were some that took some pretty substantial hits financially", Reimer said. Temperatures in eastern portions of the state soared into the mid 90s. The heat wave was preceded by an unusually cool spring, so the animals didn't have a chance to acclimatise. Terry Mader, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, reported that "Cattle, as well as other animals and humans, usually need two to four weeks to adapt to the changes in environmental conditions we observed last week. Sunny days with temperatures above the mid-80s can be stressful, particularly if there is no wind and humidity is above 50%." Similar heat waves occurred during the 1990s, when thousands of cattle were lost. Mader noted, "There's no opportunity for them to get prepared [...] Normally, you'll have one to two days in a heat wave to get prepared."Mature cattle are generally worth US$1,000 apiece.At least one person was killed and several dozen more were injured on Monday, after a heavy earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 struck near the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia.According to US Geological Survey statistics, the epicentre of the quake was sixteen kilometres from the town of Raba (about 1,300 kilometres from the capital Jakarta) at a depth of eighteen kilometres. The US Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said that it was unlikely that significant waves would be generated by the tremors.Indonesia's health ministry crisis centre head said that 38 people were injured and had to be hospitalised by the tremors. He added that a few buildings were damaged, but everything was "under control"."Residential houses, school buildings, mosques have been damaged, but not all of the buildings are totally destroyed, part of them have collapsed," said police spokesman Tjatur Aprianto.Indonesia is located on the "Ring of Fire", an area that has frequent seismic activity. Monday's earthquake comes after the country is still recovering from a heavy 7.6 magnitude earthquake that hit the area several weeks ago, killing over a thousand people and destroying hundreds of buildings. In 2004, an even stronger 9.2 earthquake off the coast off northern Sumatra killed close to a quarter of a million people in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and other neighbouring countries.A heavy earthquake has struck near Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, the US Geological Survey reports. It had a magnitude of 7.7, although its original intensity was measured at 7.6.According to the USGS, the tremor, which began at 05.15 local time (UTC 22.15 UTC) had a depth of 46 kilometres (28.6 miles) and was 230 kilometres (145 miles) southwest of Medan, Sumatra, Indonesia. The quake was originally reported as having a magnitude of 7.6, but was later determined to be 7.8.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said that local tsunami watch was in place for Indonesia."A destructive widespread tsunami threat does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data," although "there is the possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts", the centre said. According to the centre, any such tsunami would affect an area no further than 100 kilometers away from the location of the quake.Geophysicist Gerard Fryer from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre commented that scientists are looking at data from buoys in the ocean to find out whether or not a wave was already generated; however, he said that if there was a tsunami in generated, it wouldn't move a lot of water due to the shallow waters.There haven't been any reports of casualties or damage as of yet; however, witnesses on the Simeulue island reported that there were power outages, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC also reported power outages in parts of Aceh province, on the northern end of the island of Sumatra.This temblor is the heaviest to strike the region since March 2008.An earthquake with a magnitude of at least 6.0 has struck the Philippines, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has reported.The epicentre was 130 kilometres (80 miles) from the country's capital, Manila, at a depth of eighteen kilometres (11.2 miles). The temblor started at 01:29:25 local time (05:29:25 UTC), the USGS said.Some media reports contradicted the USGS' reports, saying that the earthquake's magnitude was 6.1.No reports of damage, injuries, or casualties have been reported, although many people working in the capital's central business district rushed out of buildings when the tremors started, according to Al Jazeera.The chief of the Philippine seismology institute, Renato Solidum, said to the Agence France-Presse news agency that the earthquake was felt throughout the suburbs of Manila and provinces nearby. According to the Philippine News Agency, the tremors were felt in Quezon City and Lubang Island as well.Two days of heavy rain caused severe floods in Sri Lanka, an island in the Indian Ocean, off of southeast of India.  Among central, western, and northern regions of Sri Lanka, more than 50,000 families have been displaced and six people have died.  The western, some parts of southern and north-eastern provinces were among the worst hit areas.  These floods were an additional bitter blow to the victims of last year’s tsunami who are living in temporary shelters; specially in the north-eastern province.  The rebel-held Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and some eastern parts areas are still waiting for their share of the tsunami aid.  The newly elected president has torn apart the agreement signed by the former president and the Tamil tiger rebels will have to share the aid between the two.  Their current weather is expected to improve.Heavy rain and thunderstorms have hit several areas of the UK today, causing flash floods and disrupting some transport links. The UK Met Office have issued severe weather warnings.In London, parts of Victoria Station were inches deep in water, with rain pouring in through leaks in the roof. Many shops were forced to close, and many trains were cancelled or delayed.  On the London Underground network, the Circle and District lines were suspended due to flooding, with several other lines experiencing major delays, and at least nine stations having to close. Many of the worst-hit areas have seen schools closed, and driving conditions have been deteriorating, with police advising extra caution whilst travelling on roads affected by standing water.The flash flooding follows a month of unusually wet weather, in which several areas have had to evacuate people to temporary shelters set up in schools and community centres.Heavy rain in England and Wales has caused the death of one man after he was sucked down a man hole in Hull when attempting to clear flood water. A teenage boy was also killed after being swept away by flood water of the River Sheaf, Sheffield. The flooding has inundated large areas of land, many houses and caused travel chaos with many roads and railways flooded or blocked by stranded vehicles, especially in northern England.75 mm of rain in some areas has caused severe flooding, which could get worse as forecasters predict one month's worth of rain will fall in the next 24 hours.A state of emergency has been declared in Hull and over 120 schools have been closed in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The fire service, police and coast guards have attempted many rescues today with helicopters used to remove people from stranded houses to temporary shelters.Areas also affected are along the River Severn, the River Teme, and the River Aire.The rain also affected the start of Wimbledon and created more problems for the clear-up at the end of another "mud bath" Glastonbury festival.Heavy rain has washed away a 20-metre stretch of National Highway 75, in Alba county, western Romania, leaving only one of the lanes open to traffic. Both the road and the side fences fell into the Arieş River due to the rain. Repair teams from the National Roads Department were called in to assess the damage and clear away the trees that had fallen onto the highway.Western Romania has recently faced a week of heavy rain, which has caused heavy flooding in some areas, and in other areas has damaged infrastructure.

There were very minor cases of turbulence, enough that many passengers felt it. The plane, flying at an altitude of about 12,000 metres and 39,000 feet, started getting very heavy turbulence near Sudbury, Ontario, in northern Ontario. The pilot had already spoken to the passengers through intercom about the turbulence. As soon as the seat belt light came on it was too late for many passengers and the plane, at once, started dropping. The people that were standing at the time of the incident were thrown around the cabin. A man, who later suffered from bad lacerations to his head and leg, had fallen on top of his wife.Registered nurse Kathi Nelson and licensed practical nurse Nancy Powers, both from British Columbia, were aboard the plane and treated the injured passengers until the plane landed. The injured were taken out of the plane by a large lift."The things that were in the pocket in front of me, that are normally fairly snug, went straight up and straight down again," said Powers. "People were nervous and a little bit uncomfortable with what just happened and they weren't sure whether to laugh, scream, or cry."Three passengers were taken to QEII Health Sciences Centre hospital and six others were treated at the scene after the plane landed at Halifax Stanfield International Airport at or around 7:30 p.m. All nine have been released."We provided emergency response and three ambulances were escorted to the tarmac so they were available immediately adjacent to the aircraft," said Peter Spurway, a spokesman for Robert L. Stanfield International Airport Authority, which owns Halifax Stanfield International Airport. He also said they were notified 40 minutes before of the injuries."We would only investigate if we thought that there was a good potential to advance aviation safety," Mike Cunningham of the Transportation Safety Board said today. "So if it turns out to be just an unfortunate encounter that was handled in the proper fashion by the crew, there's no need for us to investigate further than that."WestJet classified the turbulence as "moderate". Thundershowers also could have caused the problem."It's just that it's a little bumpier," said WestJet spokesman Richard Bartrem. In moderate turbulence, "the plane's going to get bounced around a little bit."The Transportation Safety Board and Transport Canada are investigating if flight crew followed proper procedures. If no evidence is found the Transportation Safety Board will back out of the investigation.Three soldiers of the Italian part of NATO's mission in Afghanistan, ISAF, were injured while their helicopter was performing an emergency landing.

Previous reports indicated at least nine people had died, but Minneapolis police revised this to four during a 7:30 a.m. (local time) press conference. Tim Dolan, the Minneapolis Police Chief later stated that "several [adding to the four] people are confirmed dead at the scene," but would not elaborate on how many. At least 79 have been injured and at least 8 are still missing, still believed to be in the rubble. The road was busy with bumper-to-bumper traffic in four lanes when the  entire 1907 foot (581 m) steel arch bridge collapsed. At least 50 cars were traveling on the bridge, including a school bus. The Red Cross said that 60 children were aboard a school bus, and that ten of those were admitted to a hospital. The entire length of the bridge over the river collapsed at 6:05 p.m. CDT (UTC-5). The bridge, built in 1967, cleared the water level by 64 feet; the deck surface and pavement were considerably higher.Reports say that people may be trapped in the water.  Further, "many voids may contain survivors, but we cannot search those voids until it's safe," said Jim Clack, Minneapolis Fire Chief, during a press conference. "One has died from drowning," said a doctor from the medical center during an 8:00 pm press conference, who also said that so far 22 are in "yellow condition" and at least six are in "critical condition."  Minneapolis officials have stated during an earlier press conference that "people are being sent downtown and all survivors are off the bridge. We are seeking help from the Red Cross." and "[...]at least 60 children are receiving trauma care some with severe injures, some with minor injuries."Most of the injured have been received by Hennepin County Medical Center in downtown Minneapolis for medical treatment. Area hospitals are requesting all off duty staff and all Minneapolis ambulances to report. Residents are being encouraged to stay away from the area to let emergency crews do their work.It is not known what caused the collapse, but there was construction being performed on the bridge's road surface which included the use of jackhammers and the FBI has ruled out terrorism."Although it is much too early to make any determination of the cause, we have no reason at this time to believe there is any nexus to terrorism," said Paul McCabe, an FBI spokesman.In 2001 a stress inspection was done and Minnesota Department of Transportation stated that the bridge "should not have any problems with fatigue cracking in the foreseeable future."Typically an eight-lane bridge, the bridge was reduced to four lanes (two in each direction) during the current construction. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) had just announced overnight lane reductions on the bridge to one lane in each direction for the late evening hours of July 31 and August 1.An overpass has collapsed in Laval, a suburb of the Montreal area of Quebec, Canada. Three lanes of the Concorde Boulevard overpass collapsed into Highway 19. At least 5 people are dead, 6 others injured, 2 critically and least 3 cars are reported to be trapped underneath the overpass. Authorities have stated that 3 cars and a motorcycle were on the overpass when it collapsed. Rescue workers and construction engineers have brought in heavy equipment, cranes and drills to break up the overpass into roughly a dozen smaller segments for removal. At the time of the collapse, authorities reported that 2 vehicles were trapped under the debris. Around midnight, the two vehicles were removed from the debris, and the five occupants of both vehicles were pronounced dead on the site. Transport Quebec and Sûreté du Québec have reported that around 9:30 a.m. local time, people called 911, reporting that small chunks of concrete had fallen from the Boulevard de la Concorde (Concorde Boulevard) overpass over Autoroute 19, and Transport Quebec sent a crew to inspect. At around 11:55 a.m., Transport's Québec patrol arrived at the overpass confirming the facts. The patroller moved the chunks off the highway and produced a report, sent to the Transports Quebec branch responsible for Laval. The incident happened at approximately 12:30 p.m. local time, local residents described what sounded like "an earthquake". It is not known at this time how the collapse occurred, or when it might be repaired. It is currently assumed that the cement bondings to the steel rods which held the overpass to its approaches gave way, and with nothing to hold the overpass' central span up, it collapsed.This isn't the first overpass collapse in Laval. In 2000, a section of the Highway 15 overpass collapsed, killing one and injuring two others. It was later determined that the collapse in 2000 was caused by a manufacturing defect.The Dubliner, a famous Irish pub in the Digbeth area of Birmingham, has been destroyed by a fire that was started around 4.30am on the 26th July 2006, apparently deliberately.Reports indicate between 100 and 120 firefighters were tackling the blaze at its height.

To combat the brush fire the Seminole fire department had to bring out equipment normally used to combat forest fires.Firefighters were still on the scene up to eight hours later to ensure that the fire did not reignite. The man and his dog escaped from the house, however the man did sustain minor injuries. The Red Cross will assist the man with food, shelter and clothing for a few days.A State Fire Marshal office investigator revealed that the fire was accidental and was caused by an unattended grill which ignited the house and subsequently the woods.Honda have issued a recall for 646,000 cars around the world due to a potential fault that could cause a fire. The recall involves the 'Jazz' range of cars, which is known by its alternative name, Fit, in some countries.Three incidents involving the problem, caused by a defective master switch, have been reported worldwide, two in the US and one in South Africa.  In September 2009, Vanilla Nurse, a two-year old girl, was sleeping in one of the models, when the hatchback in Cape Town caught fire.  Following the accident, Honda "launched an extensive investigation to determine the cause of the incident," according to a statement issued today.  Although they could not isolate the cause of the fire, "the investigation has shown that water intrusion into the power window switch housing may in some instances cause a short circuit, which in exceptional circumstances may lead to potential damages". Just 10% of cars are expected to need new switches. The remainder will need a waterproof skirt in order to keep water out.Rival Toyota was forced to recall vehicles on Thursday, citing floor mats that may stick accelerator pedals to the floor.

Some are threatening to storm the mine while soldiers are trying to keep them calm and rescuers continue to pick through the rock and debris with hand tools, fearing that any power equipment might set off another explosion. The local newspaper's headline caused panic by quoting one of over a dozen surviving miners who were close enough to the exits to escape: "They are surely dead," (La Prensa de Monclova).  However, Arturo Vilchis, Civil Protection Director, refused to speculate on the condition of the miners, while Javier de la Fuente, an engineering contractor with mine owner Grupo México S.A. de C.V. also tried to hold out some hope.The men were each supposed to be carrying oxygen tanks, each with a six hour supply, and there's some hope that they could reach other oxygen supply tanks, or that some air might be reaching them through the ventilation shafts into which rescuers have been pumping more oxygen since shortly after the explosion.Juan Rebolledo, vice president of international affairs for Grupo México, assured onlookers that U.S. mining experts were on the way, and officials at the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration have confirmed that they've sent a specialized equipment truck and several mining experts which should arrive at the mine site on Wednesday afternoon.Meanwhile Consuelo Aguilar, a spokeswoman for the National Miners' Union, called for an investigation into Grupo México's responsibility for the disaster.

An unknown source caused a fire in the basket of the tethered balloon, which then broke free and rose into the air.Of the 12 passengers and one pilot on board at the time, 11 escaped the balloon with severe burns and other non-life-threatening injuries by jumping out in mid-air. The balloon then collapsed, crashing into a motorhome park with two people still trapped on board, who were killed in the subsequent fire. Four static caravans and two cars were also destroyed in the blaze.The two deceased are believed to be a mother and daughter. Their family was on scene during the disaster and watched as the balloon burnt up and crashed.Witness Don Randall, who photographed the accident, said the thing went up about 400 feet (122m) in the air at which point it melted enough of the balloon it collapsed."The basket was basically a fireball. It just dropped like a stone. I'm just thinking, 'Oh geez, I hope there's nobody in that thing. It's basically a burning death up there."'Bill Yearwood, an investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told reporters what preliminary information was available: "The crew loaded 12 passengers and was preparing to launch when a fire erupted. The pilot asked the passengers to get out of the basket. The balloon was tethered at the time, but then broke and came loose. The balloon climbed into the air before collapsing in a residential area in the park. They were all trying to get out. I can't tell you what exactly happened when the balloon was loosened from the tether."Injured survivor Diana Rutledge questioned the pilot, Steve Pennock,'s actions after the fire broke out, pointing out that he was first off the balloon. "He was in perfect shape," she said. "I thought, what is this all about? Wouldn't he have stayed on to try to stop the fires?"Joyce Genest, a resident at the park, also questioned procedure that day. "I stopped to watch the balloon get inflated," she said. "Normally it takes 25 minutes and it's quite gorgeous to watch. They are never in a big hurry. This time they took about ten minutes." She said the passengers then got straight into the balloon, an unusual occurrence. "Normally the pilot gets in and tests the gun twice and then everybody gets in." As soon as everybody was in, he hit the gun and the flame went sideways."The Hotel Arpit Palace in the Karol Bagh area of the Indian capital, New Delhi, caught fire yesterday morning. At least seventeen people died and 35 were rescued, according to officials, some of whom were hospitalised. Many of the affected guests were Indian; the Myanma embassy confirmed two Buddhist pilgrims from Myanmar also died. The area is popular with visitors, with budget hotels and shopping districts. Firefighters dispatched around 30 vehicles; personnel reportedly had control of the blaze by 8:00am local time. No cause was immediately known, but a fire officer said wooden panels led to corridors becoming unusable for escape.Local media reported most of the deceased suffocated. One child was, according to the fire service, among the dead. The hotel's website estimated 120 people were in the 25-year-old building at the time. A judicial inquiry was ordered, according to police. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted "Deeply saddened by the loss of lives" and offered "condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. May the injured recover soon."According to eyewitnesses, the deceased child and his mother were among victims who leapt from the burning hotel. The top floor has been extensively damaged and blackened by the blaze. Satyendra Jain, the city's home minister, said "Buildings can only be constructed up to four floors in Delhi[...] This hotel had been built up to six floors. It's gross negligence on the part of the officers who allowed the extra floors to be built. The entire hotel has wooden panelling, this shows carelessness on the part of the owner."Fires are common in India. Activists claim safety standards are routinely ignored.A Midland, Michigan hotel was temporarily quarantined Thursday night when a letter with suspicious white powder was opened at the Ashman Court Hotel on Main Street.A hotel employee is said to have opened the letter around 16:00 UTC time on Thursday.  Shortly after, the police, FBI and HAZMAT teams were called to the building. Preliminary results from FBI tests showed that the envelope did not contain the deadly bacteria anthrax, as first thought.The letter contained "a threat" according to local reports, however details were not released.  It is also unknown as to what substance the white powder is.This is the second anthrax scare on the city this year, exactly four months ago the Midland Daily News office, located across the street to the hotel, was sent a similar envelope with suspicious powder.  It is not known if the two cases are related or not.A house fire in Bristol, England has caused the deaths of two brothers, identified as Charlie, aged five, and seven-year-old Mackenzie. Emergency services were called to the scene in the early hours of Saturday morning.The bodies were discovered by firemen, at the scene in the suburb of Bradley Stoke around 0630 UTC. Police and ambulance services were also in attendance. Prior to their arrival, three other children and two adults escaped from the building in Merryweather Close through windows.Speaking on behalf of Avon Fire and Rescue Service, manager William Roberts explained: "When crews arrived, the fire was fully developed and engulfing the first floor and roof space. Sadly, when crews entered the building they found the children. They were both upstairs, one in back bedroom, one in front. It is a sad day for the Bradley Stoke community and Avon fire. The ceiling has fallen in on itself and on top of our evidence. This is probably the worst fire I've seen in my 32 years."According to Roberts, smoke alarms were in the building, however the damage was "so extensive" that it is uncertain as to whether or not they were functioning correctly. "A full investigation has been launched by the police and fire investigators. No formal identification has yet taken place," Avon and Somerset Constabulary's Detective Sergeant Simon Chubb stated.A fire that started in the attic on Baynes Street between Bird and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, New York left 2 families, totaling 6 people, homeless including three children.A resident living on the second floor of the two family house called 911 at around 8:00 p.m. on August 16, 2006 and reported the smell of smoke. When firefighters arrived they "saw flames shooting out of the third floor window," a firefighter told Wikinews.Firefighters said that there was "severe damage from the fire to the third floor," but the second and first floor apartments suffered smoke and water damage.Witnesses say that smoke from the blaze could be seen as far as a half mile away.There were no injuries to any residents or firefighters and the cause of the blaze is still under investigation. Residents of the house would not comment.Traffic is bumper to bumper on Houston interstate highways as citizens try to evacuate ahead of Hurricane Rita. Houston Mayor Bill White urged citizens in low areas of the city to "begin making their evacuation plans" in preparation for what is currently the 3rd strongest hurricane to ever form in the Atlantic Ocean and the worst to enter the Gulf of Mexico.Acting U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director David Paulison was quoted saying "I strongly, strongly urge Gulf Coast residents to pay close attention to this storm. It's already a Category 4, a huge storm, it's in warm waters and there's a potential for it to increase more," at a briefing in Washington DC. The storm was upgraded to a category 5 hurricane on Thursday, the strongest category of storm. Recently, Rita has lost intensity since entering cooler waters and facing wind shear from an opposing weather front, and is now a Category 4 storm.Houston, Texas lies 50 feet above sea-level on average, but the area is still prone to flooding as the region is very flat and supported by multiple bayous. In 2001, following Tropical Storm Allison, large areas of Houston remained flooded after receiving 10 inches (250 mm) of rain, causing over $US 5 billion in damage. Meteorologists fear that Rita could cause similar, if not worse damage.Located 50 miles away from the inland city of Houston, and situated on the Gulf’s coastline, lies Galveston, Texas at a mere 8 feet above sea level. The island city, with a population of nearly 60,000, built a 10-mile-long, 17-foot-high solid granite barrier next to the sea as a defense against hurricanes.The National Hurricane Center currently predicts a storm surge from Rita in the 15 to 20 feet range, along with strong battering waves. The city manager of Galveston, Steve LeBlanc said, "Galveston is going to suffer. And we are going to need to get it back in order as quickly as possible. I would say that we probably have 90 percent of our residents have left the island. It feels like a ghost town to me, and that's a good thing."Rita is expected to slow down and linger after making landfall in the region. That could possibly mean even more damage from heavy rainfall accumulations. The governor of Louisiana, Kathleen Blanco, said the rain is a threat to New Orleans. Anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of rainfall are expected there, when earlier predictions estimated that 3 inches of rainfall would be enough to cause more flooding in the city.The Chinese news agency Xinhua reports that there have been two massive explosions within seconds of each other, at about 11:30 p.m. local time, in a warehouse in the port of Dongjiang in Tianjin, a city of 15 million, near Beijing, in north-east China.At least thirteen people have been killed and between 250 and 400 people injured. Two firefighters are also believed to be missing at the scene. Mobile phone footage taken by locals shows a large fireball in the Binhai New Area of the city. The warehouse is thought to belong RuiHai Logistics, and may have been storing explosives.The two blasts were significant enough to register approximately magnitude 2.3 and 2.9 on the seismic scale as reported by the China Earthquake Administration.A huge fire at a Chilean prison in San Miguel has killed at least 81 inmates, and injured another 14, including a firefighter and three gendarmerie officers, the Chilean Health Minister Jaime Mañalich reported. Mañalich said that the injured inmates suffered "[...] facial burns, and are currently intubated with mechanical ventilation in different hospitals."Pedro Hernández, representing the Chilean gendarmerie officers union said that "they are trying to identify the 81 dead inmates now." President Sebastián Piñera went to the Santiago's Central Post where five inmates are being attended. During a press conference, Piñera announced the creation of new jails with more facilities for the inmates. Piñera also confirmed that 83 inmates had died, and that another 21 were injured, 7 of them due to minor asphyxiation.The fire is considered the worst accident in the country's jail history. Fifteen corpses have been identified, Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter reported.A football match between Unión Española and Club de Fútbol Universidad de Chile was canceled by ANFP (Professional Football National Association) after the fire. It was going to take place today at 16:00 local time (19:00 UTC) in the Estadio Santa Laura.More than five years after the 11 September 2001 attacks, human remains from the World Trade Center's fallen towers have been uncovered at the cross of 29th Street and 11th Avenue in New York City.Works from Manhattan's Consolidation Edison found the remains and took them to a natural gas vehicle refueling station, where they called medical examiners to the scene. It is unclear when the remains were found or what condition they are in.An estimated 2,749 people died as a consequence of the September 11 attacks, and family members of about 1,150 victims still do not know whether the remains of victims have been, or ever will be, found.A double-decker ferry capsized late Monday in the Brahmaputra River near Guwahati, India.  The ferry was over capacity when a storm caused it to overturn and break in half. The ferry passengers were mostly women and children.  Officials estimate there are at least 200 casualties.  Inclement weather hindered rescue attempts and as of Tuesday, 103 bodies have been recovered. No life jackets or lifeboats were aboard the ferry at the time of the event.According to officials, many of the bodies may have floated 25 miles down river to Bangladesh, due to strong currents. The river is a vital source of irrigation and transportation to the people along its coast. It is approximately 1,800 miles long, making rescue efforts difficult to pursue quickly. Rescuers are working around the clock in efforts to locate any remaining survivors.About 150 passengers swam to a nearby shore.  The remaining passengers are missing and are feared dead. Reports indicate this is one of the worst ferry accidents ever recorded in India. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh issued a statement expressing his remorse over the death of the passengers and announcing that he would compensate the next of kin of all casualties Rs 200,000, or about $4,000 US dollars.Typhoon Frank stormed across the Philippine Sea June 21, 2008 capsizing numerous boats, killing hundreds and leaving an estimated 1,330 missing in total including 820 passengers and crew from the MV Princess of the Stars ferry.Since then Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) teams in Cebu City, Philippines made up of experts from the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP). and INTERPOL have painstakingly matched DNA from recovered bodies to that of blood samples donated by relatives of those still missing."The 23,000-ton vessel was also carrying tens of thousands of pounds of commercial insecticide and many bodies still remain trapped inside the wreckage" according to a recent press release from the ICMP."With fingerprint identification out of the question for most of the victims, and dental records not available, this leaves only DNA as a means of identification, with samples from recovered victims matched to those provided by the missing passengers’ relatives."An NBI-DVI report explains "DNA matches are made by comparing profiles from victims to a database of profiles from their relatives. A minimum of two close relatives [are] sought for each individual."NBI-DVI has so far collected 1,916 blood samples from relatives of missing victims representing 809 missing persons. These samples are then matched against the 318 DNA samples from recovered bodies received by the ICMP.“Almost three months have passed since our country was struck by one of the worst typhoons in memory, with ‘Frank’ causing the sinking of the Princess of the Stars with hundreds of passengers and crew on board," said NBI Director Nestor M. Mantaring in the press release."The NBI, through its DVI team, was tasked [with identifying] the victims of this tragedy. With help from INTERPOL and the ICMP, we have reached the 100th DNA-matched result which led to the identification and release of the bodies to their respective families."We are committed to doing this until the last possible victim is identified and returned to their family,” he concluded.On Sunday, between one and one and a half million people had gathered in Budapest for St Stephen's Day fireworks when a severe storm hit.According to the Budapest Fire Department, a 30-to-40 year-old man and a 12-year-old girl died when a large tree fell on a crowd of spectators on the Buda side, while the cause of an elderly woman's death in Pest remains unclear yet. One man is still missing.The storm brought winds of at least 100 km/h and large hail. Roof tiles were torn off, trees knocked down, and cars and windows smashed. A stage at the celebration collapsed, causing panic among the audience.Most of the injuries were caused by falling tiles and debris from roofs. The fire services were called to 250 locations during the night and reports of damage are expected to increase during the day."Five minutes into the display a wind starts rolling in, about a minute later, the wind is reaching 70km/h... then the rain comes, but so hard and so large that it slaps your skin like a needle, then hail fell from the sky, people panicking and screaming and running over each other. I lost my sister and her friend, and on my way there were two disabled people in wheelchairs, people just jumping over and pushing them," Armand Versace said. Meteorologists say they had warned that the storm was approaching. Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany has ordered an inquiry into why the event went ahead. The Budapest City Council security committee held an extraordinary meeting late on Sunday and the civic security directorate decided to set up a special unit to help those in need.Hurricane Adrian, the first storm of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season, continued on its northeasterly track into Central America early Friday morning, making landfall near San Salvador, capital city of El Salvador. The storm has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and is moving northeast at 9 mph (15 km/h). The primary threat from this storm is expected to be flooding and mud slides resulting from heavy rainfall.The Salvadoran Comité de Emergencia Nacional (National Emergency Committee) reported   that over 15,400 people were evacuated from high risk areas.Adrian formed over the Eastern Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, May 17, and began moving to the northeast, an unusual track for storms at that latitude, which generally move toward the west. On Thursday morning, readings obtained by a United States Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft led forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center to upgrade the storm's classification to a hurricane.As of 1 a.m. Central time on May 20 (03:00 UTC), the center of Adrian was located on the coast of El Salvador, about 35 miles (195 km) southwest of San Salvador, moving northeast at 9 mph (15 km/h) with maximum sustained windspeeds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Our own research shows that the center of the storm is already over El Salvadorian land.The storm is expected to cause heavy rainfall to Guatemala and Honduras. Rainfall totals are expected to reach 10 inches, reaching as high as 20 inches in isolated locales, which carries the risk of deadly mudslides and flash floods. Signs of Hurricane Adrian have already appeared in coastal regions of Guatemala and El Salvador.The north-easterly track of this storm is extremely unusual. Only 4 tropical systems are recorded to have made landfall in Guatemala or El Salvador since 1966. The only named system ever to do so was Tropical Storm Andres on June 7, 1997, near San Salvador.On the storm's current track, its remnants are expected to cross into Caribbean Sea. The storm could then regenerate and become Tropical Storm Arlene, the first named storm of the Atlantic season. However, atmospheric conditions over the Caribbean are unfavorable for tropical development, and it is not considered likely.The National Hurricane Center in Miami is calling Hurricane Dean "extremely dangerous," saying that the storm is gaining strength and will likely become a Category 5 storm. The storm's winds are currently clocked at 150 mph, classifying it as a Category 4 hurricane. A Category 5 hurricane means the storm has winds of over 155 mph and has the potential to cause "catastrophic" damage. Dean is currently moving through the eastern Caribbean, and is heading towards the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The storm is expected to hit Jamaica on Sunday, and then gain even more power as it strikes Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Monday.Dean could hit the mainland of the United States on Wednesday. Therefore, officials in Texas and Louisiana are currently making major preparations.Rick Perry, the Governor of Texas, said the hurricane is an "imminent threat," saying the state is preparing for its arrival. Task forces have been put on alert, and supply trucks and other resources are in position.Governor Kathleen Blanco of Louisiana declared a state of emergency yesterday so local governments can move forward with emergency plans if necessary. However, forecasters say there is little chance of Dean moving toward Louisiana. Instead, the storm is expected to threaten Mexico or Texas.A hurricane watch has been issued for Haiti from the Haiti/Dominican Republic border to Port-au-Prince. Jamaica has opened all shelters and Cuba has declared a "state of alert" in preparation for the storm. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for the U.S. and Spanish Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.At 5 a.m. EDT, the center of Hurricane Dean was about 240 miles south-southwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and 660 miles east-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and was moving west at 14 mph. However, the storm is expected to pick up speed today.Hurricane Dean could force NASA to cut short Endeavour's flight. Mission management team chairman Leroy Cain said, "We'd really like to protect an option to be able to end the mission on Tuesday."The Associated Press reports several deaths and significant damage on the islands of St. Lucia, Dominica and Martinique.According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Dean is now a Category 2 hurricane. The Atlantic's first hurricane of the season had top sustained winds at 100 mph at 5 p.m. EDT. Dean's winds were measured at 75 mph earlier in the day.A meteorologist from the National Hurricane Center warns, "Dean is likely to become a major hurricane in the eastern Caribbean Sea." Adding that one forecast shows it could become "an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane by the time it reaches the northwestern Caribbean Sea."Forecasters claim the storm could threaten the Lesser Antilles by Friday. Dean is then forecast to pass over Jamaica by 2 p.m. EDT Sunday, and then move across the Yucatan Peninsula and enter the Gulf of Mexico by Tuesday.Hurricane warnings have been issues for the islands of St. Lucia and Dominica. The Barbados weather service has issued a tropical storm warning for the island of Barbados and a tropical storm watch for St. Vincent and St. Maarten. Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Texas Governor Rick Perry said, "It's so far out, but it's not too early to start preparing...We have more notice than with Erin. We're glad for that especially since [Dean] is projected to bring some strength."At 2 p.m. EDT, the storm was about 210 miles due east of Barbados and about 305 miles east of Martinique, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is moving west at 23 mph. Hurricane Dean was officially named early this morning.Hurricane Dean hit the coast of Mexico's mainland today as a Category 2 hurricane, with winds sustained at 100 mph.Dean moved across the Bay of Campeche, eyeing over 100 oil platforms and several oil ports in the center of the country's oil industry. Over 14,000 workers in the area had to be evacuated.The eye of the storm hit Tecolutla, a major tourist town. Over 10,000 people were evacuated.Currently, there are no reports of deaths or serious injuries following the landfall in Mexico. However, the storm caused major damage to some areas with very heavy rains shutting down many roadways and flooding many homes.Overall Dean is being blamed for at least 20 deaths in the Caribbean.The storm has since been downgraded to Category 1 status.The National Hurricane Center in Miami now says that the Atlantic's first hurricane has reached Category 4 status, with winds up to 140 mph (225 km/h). Dean is now being called a "major hurricane."While the storm is currently moving west through the Caribbean, additional strengthening is forecast within the next 24 hours.A hurricane watch has now been issued for Haiti from the Haiti/Dominican Republic border to Port-au-Prince. The Dominican Republic government has changed the tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning from Cabo Engano to Haiti. Also, a hurricane watch has now been issued from Cabo Beata to the Haiti.At 1:45 p.m. EDT, the eye of the Hurricane Dean was 175 miles (282 km) west of Martinique and 300 miles (480 km) southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.Tropical storm warnings continue to be in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico as the storm is moving west at 22 mph (35 km/h) and could intensify over the warmer waters toward Jamaica.Dean is currently forecast to dump two inches (~50 mm) of rain on Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a few isolated areas receiving a possible five inches (~130 mm). The National Hurricane Center says it is too early to project whether the storm poses a threat to the U.S..The storm moved through St. Lucia and Martinique today, causing structural damage, knocking out power, and flooding roads. Also, a 62-year-old man drowned today, being the storm's first death.Residents along the US Gulf Coast evacuated or hunkered down Saturday as Hurricane Dennis lashed the Florida Keys with wind and sheets of rain and churned along a path toward areas still rebuilding from last year's storms.More than 1.4 million people from the Florida Panhandle to Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi are under evacuation orders. Landfall was expected Sunday afternoon anywhere from the Florida Panhandle to southeast Louisiana.At 6am CDT July 10, the center of Hurricane Dennis was located near latitude 28.2 north, longitude 86.2 west.Dennis is moving north-northwest at about 15 mph.As of 6am CDT July 10, according to the National Weather Service, maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph, making Dennis a  category four hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. The National Weather Service is calling this an extremely dangerous storm.Hurricane force winds extend outward 125-140 miles from the center.  Rainfall totals of 12 inches are expected along the United States Gulf Coast, meaning flash flooding  will be a concern in many areas.  Storm surges in excess of 12-14 feet are expected along the Gulf Coast from the Florida panhandle west through Louisiana.  Isolated tornadoes are possible throughout Florida tonight and tomorrow.Dennis churned into Cuba packing winds in excess of 145 mph, leaving homes destroyed, and leading to reliance on ham radio as a means of communication.  According to CNN, Dennis caused at least 10 deaths throughout Cuba.  The Cuban Meteorological Service reported destruction to 85% of its communication infrastructure.  Flooding led to widespread problems in Haiti, where the storm claimed 22 lives according to CNN.  Mudslides, triggered by the large volume of rain blocked roads and sent 3,000 people to seek shelter in designated storm shelters in Jamaica.  When the storm moved across Cuba, oil companies began shutting down rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and residents in coastal areas of the United States started boarding up windows and preparing for the worst.  The storm is expected to make landfall in the United States sometime Sunday evening, following a similar path as Hurricane Ivan last year.  Current paths indicate the Florida Keys will be brushed by on the way to the Florida panhandle, coming ashore near Pensacola, FL. Its current location is {{Map|lat=27.2|lat2=N|long=85.8|long2=W], about 210 miles south of Panama City, Florida, and about 290 miles southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi.The storm is creating seas in the 12-foot range, with highest seas reported at 30 feet according the National Weather Service.  Residents in the Florida panhandle, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana are all under a hurricane warning as current predictions show the storm's progression to effect those states.Hurricane Dennis regained strength during its north-westerly crossing of the Gulf of Mexico to surge into Florida's western panhandle near Mobile, Alabama with Category 3 force that packed sustained winds of 120 mph.Santa Rosa, Okaloosa and Escambia were the first Florida counties hit by the eyewall of the hurricane at 3:25 EDT Sunday afternoon.The small storm eye of the powerful hurricane spared the region more major destruction.The compact storm picked up travel speed from 14 to 18 mph as it came to within 3 hours of landfall, where the storm's eye made for the Pensacola Bay. Its strength suddenly dropped from Category 4 before it struck land and moved swiftly inland. It continued to gain speed, traveling at 21 mph, while its strength sapped to Category 2 on a track into the Ohio Valley.Residents of Fort Walton Beach and Pensacola who remained in the region, were told hours before the storm's arrival that storm shelters were full, and they were urged to stay home or find other shelter. In Escambia County Florida, officials announced at 2pm they were no longer able to respond to 911 calls for help due to the high winds.The storm came 10 months after Hurricane Ivan, which struck the panhandle and Mobile Bay region last year. Dennis landed just 50 miles east of Ivan's, where recovery efforts from that storm were still ongoing. The Dennis landfall matched Ivan's Category 3 wind speeds.Power outages were reported in Mobile and across the panhandle. Florida governor Jeb Bush promised in a televised press conference that all efforts to restore power would be done as quickly as possible so that, "people can help themselves" recover from the storm. A hospital administrator at Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola said it lost power at 2:30pm, and can operate 60 hours using back-up power generators.Sunday evening, President Bush declared that Florida has major disaster areas, making the state eligible for FEMA assistance.  In Alabama, interstate highway I-65 was re-routed for northbound traffic only when an evacuation order was issued on Friday, by Governor Riley, for Mobile and Baldwin counties. Northern parts of the state, up into the southern part of Tennessee, were booked full with those who evacuated. A curfew lifted Sunday at 6pm in the city of Mobile.The Mississippi Gulf Coast region was victim of the Category 5 storm, Hurricane Camille, in 1969.As the slow-moving tropical cyclone known as Hurricane Dorian finally cleared the Bahamas yesterday, the level of destruction left in its wake began to emerge. Dorian made its initial landfall as a Category 5 hurricane in the Abaco Islands on Sunday. Its wind speeds reached 185 mph (~295 km/h), tied for the strongest sustained winds at landfalling on record, according to the National Hurricane Center.After landfall, the speed at which Dorian moved slowed down dramatically, resulting in a very long stay over the island of Grand Bahama. In a thirty hour period of Monday and Tuesday, Dorian only traversed thirty miles, according to CNN. The National Hurricane Center said all tropical storm warnings were lifted as of yesterday morning and Dorian had also been downgraded to a Category 2 storm.According to the BBC, residents were doing most rescue work themselves using boats and personal watercraft. Prime minister Hubert Minnis said yesterday night that twenty people have been confirmed killed. "We expect that this number will increase", he noted."Parts of Abaco are decimated [...] There is severe flooding. There is severe flooding damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure", Minnis said. "The southern aspect of Abaco has suffered less devastation than the north. The Sandy Point area and progressing north has not suffered as much devastation that was seen in the Marsh Harbour vicinity. The international airport on Abaco is under water. The runway is currently flooded. In fact, the area around the airport now looks like a lake."A large number of homes and other buildings in the affected areas have been destroyed with some estimates by the Red Cross and government officials ranging from 45% to 60% destruction. The United Nations said some 60 thousand people are in need of food and drinking water.Dorian was northbound as it left the Bahamas.Hurricane Emily has hit the small eastern Caribbean island of Grenada. The hurricane, which has been upgraded to  Category 2  status, hit the island early this morning and has caused widespread damage. It has been reported that many buildings have lost their roofs and there has been much flooding.The storm affected the northern parishes of St. Patrick's and St. Andrew's the worst and also caused considerable damage to the nearby islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. No fatalities have yet been reported. Earlier this year Hurricane Dennis hit Cuba and Haiti, leaving 41 people dead.Last year Hurricane Ivan devastated the island and resulted in the deaths of 39 people. Emily is the fifth tropical storm to develop this hurricane season. It was the earliest time on record that five named storms had formed in the Atlantic. Emily, along with Dennis, reached hurricane status. Arlene, Bret and Cindy remained tropical storms. The British Royal Navy, which usually deploys two ships to the Caribbean, has placed the destroyer HMS Liverpool and the tanker RFA Wave Knight on standby. During Hurricane Frances and Ivan last year, HMS Richmond and RFA Wave Ruler were actively involved in humanitarian relief. Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada had effectively run his country for seven hours from Richmond after his home had been destroyed.Hurricane Felix made landfall in Nicaragua on Tuesday. It reached shore as a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest level of such storms. Within hours, winds had weakened considerably and Felix became a Category 1 hurricane as it moved inland. There remain concerns of potential mudslides due to the heavy rains which continue. From Nicaragua, the storm system appears headed towards Guatemala and Honduras.Hurricane Felix has now been raised to a Category 5 hurricane. It has been moving through the warm Caribbean waters, and has already damaged many Dutch islands in the area. It is reported as having maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (266 km/h), and is heading upwards towards Central America.It is expected to skirt Honduras before hitting Belize. It is predicted to cause large scale destruction in Belize and surrounding areas. It has already affected Aruba, Curacao, and Bonaire. One Bonaire resident, Siomara Albertus, said "Thankfully we didn't get a very bad storm. My dog slept peacefully through the night".It has already caused tens of thousands of tourists and residents to be stuck in their homes or places of residence, preparing for the worst. Many residents had installed storm shutters, and taken boats ashore, however there was very little wind damage.It is currently moving at around 18mph (29 km/h), and is approximately 390 miles (628 km) off the coast of Jamaica.Hurricane Felix, the sixth named storm and second hurricane this season, has strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane. As of 5:00 EDT Sunday, it is located 440 miles off the coast of Kingston, Jamaica, in the Caribbean Sea.It has maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h), and 165 mph (266 km/h) gusts. It is moving at approximately 20 mph (32 km/h) to the northwest, into the warmer waters of the eastern Caribbean. It is still strengthening, and expected to reach Category 5 as it continues in warm waters.Jamaica is on storm watch, as after being hit by Hurricane Dean last month there is a possibility of more damage. It is expected however that it will be outside the main areas of affect, which will be further south. The risks are mainly torrential rain, flash flooding, mudslides, and slips.It is likely to affect the western coastal areas of Mexico with strong winds and four to eight inches (100 mm to 130 mm) of rain when it passes through there sometime this week.Tropical storm Humberto suddenly gained strength last night and became a hurricane just off the Texas coast.At 12:15 a.m. CDT a hurricane warning was issued for the Gulf coast from High Island, Texas, to Cameron, Louisiana.  The center of the hurricane was at 29.4N 94.4W, moving toward the north-northeast at seven knots.  The diameter of the eye was ten nautical miles, with maximum sustained winds predicted to be 70 knots with gusts to 85 knots.  Twelve foot seas were expected.By 10:00 a.m. CDT it had weakened back to a tropical storm.In an advisory issued yesterday evening, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) confirmed that a hurricane warning for Hurricane Humberto, a category 3 hurricane, was in effect for Bermuda. Humberto was expected to pass by Bermuda late Wednesday night.The NHC's "Hurricane Humberto Intermediate Advisory Number 25A", released at 8:00 p.m. AST on Wednesday (0000 UTC Thursday morning) placed Humberto 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of Bermuda. At the time, Humberto had maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) and was moving east-by-northeast at 20 mph (31 kph).The NHC predicted that Humberto would pass by Bermuda Wednesday night, before beginning to weaken on Thursday. The advisory also noted dangerous surf conditions, with waves over 30 feet high being recorded offshore by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoy, warning of a possibility of coastal flooding.Bermuda was rarely hit by hurricanes according to CNN who reported that over the last century, only 21 hurricanes reached within 100 miles of the islands. The most recent hurricane to reach Bermuda, Hurricane Gonzalo, made landfall there in 2014.Hurricanes are a form of tropical cyclones. On the Saffir–Simpson scale used by the NHC for classifying tropical cyclones, a category 3 hurricane must sustain winds of at least 111 miles per hour. The cut-off for a category 4 hurricane, the next stronger classification, is 130 mph. Hurricanes classified as category 3 or above are considered to be "major" hurricanes.According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Ike has made landfall on Cuba, with sustained winds of 120 miles per hour and above, making it a category three hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. At 8:00 p.m. (eastern time) Ike was centered approximately 60 miles North of Guantanamo and made landfall around 11:00 p.m. in the town of Cabo Lucrecia. Millions of Cubans have evacuated cities along the shoreline and moved to higher grounds as meteorologists say Eastern Cuba has never seen a storm this big."These people have never seen a Category 4 - or a category 3," said Jose Rubiera a meteorologist on Cubavision. The NHC states that a storm surge of 9 to 12 feet is expected along the Eastern shores.Ike is currently moving West at around 13 miles an hour, but the National Hurricane Center states that they expect Ike to turn to a more West-Northwest direction within the coming days.So far, Ike has killed 58 people in Haiti, 13 of the victims were children.Hurricane Katrina is now over the U.S. mainland and has caused more than US$12 billion of damage. Some estimates are as high as $30 billion.New Orleans was spared the most intense winds as the hurricane weakened as it made landfall, and its track turned slightly east, away from the city. However, the area was still subjected to sustained winds of more than 100mph, and rainfall as heavy as six inches per hour.Future prices of crude oil rose above $70/barrel in the U.S. on Monday in the wake of Katrina’s surge through oil and refinery processing facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm forced operators to shut down an estimated 1 million barrels of daily refining capacity in the region that accounts for nearly a quarter of total domestic production.A U.S. spokesman for the Bush administration said the government will consider releasing crude oil from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve if requested by refiners. OPEC has pledged to blunt the impact by increasing production to compensate.White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters that Michael Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), briefed Mr. Bush before he left his Texas ranch for Arizona where he will deliver a speech on Medicare. Brown said it would take time before an assessment is possible for when refineries could resume activity.President Bush authorized loans from the strategic reserve to help make up for missing supplies when Hurricane Ivan struck in 2004.As hurricane Katrina moves beyond the Floridian peninsula, death tolls have begun to surface.  On Friday, the official count was seven dead, at least five missing. 4 people in Broward, 3 in Miami. The forecast for Hurricane Katrina predicts that it will continue on its present northwesterly course and approach the panhandle of Florida and the Mississippi delta region in the next few days.Katrina made landfall on Friday in southern Florida's Miami and Fort Lauderdale metropolitan areas. Packing 80 mph winds, it downed trees and power lines as it slowly crossed the peninsula. It swamped some areas with as much as 12 inches of rainfall. Katrina is now a category 4, and gaining power over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Large portions of Broward, Miami-Dade, and Menroe counties have no electricity, and thousands of customers in the tri-county area have no cable service.Hurricane Katrina is responsible for the collapse of a highway overpass, under construction, and for a warehouse fire in Metro Fort Lauderdale.Schools in Miami-Dade and Broward were closed when the storm made landfall. Menroe County schools were in session.More on Hurricane Katrina as the storm progresses.With victims of Hurricane Katrina moved to shelters and remote locations, their relatives and friends in other parts of the world have turned to the web to try and establish contact and confirm their health. Many families living in the path of Katrina have even been split up as they are rescued and now desperately need to contact each other.Several web sites have started forums for posting information on missing people. The forums also allow individuals and families in the path of the hurricane who are safe post their information, where they are now located and how their family should contact them.The American Red Cross is keeping records of all persons they treat and assist, but those records are not available either by phone or online. They have issued a press release titled AMERICAN RED CROSS URGENT FAMILY ALERT.  Quoting, in part:The Red Cross does not have information on the well being of any individuals.Our phone lines are being overwhelmed with calls, and we appreciate the desire to know how people fared during the storm.Please do not contact any Red Cross media representatives with welfare inquiries.Hurricane Paloma, which the U.S. National Hurricane Center yesterday labeled as "extremely dangerous", has recently hit Cuba.In preparation of this, at 1500 UTC yesterday, the Cuban provinces of Granma and Holguin were issued with a Hurricane warning by the country's government. Due to updated forecasts, it has also removed the waning for the province of Sancti Spiritus.220,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the Camaguey province, while 170,000 were evacuated from the province of Las Tunas.The Hurricane is now weakening, however, with the NOAA stating that "continued weakening is expected over the next day or two, even after Paloma moves off the coast of Cuba."The NOAA has also stated that "Paloma is expected to produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches over eastern Cuba.  Rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are possible over the central Bahamas."Hurricane Paloma was the seventeenth tropical depression of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Paloma developed out of a strong tropical disturbance off the northern coast of Honduras on November 5. The disturbance had slowly developed into a tropical depression. The depression then became a tropical storm then a hurricane.Hurricane Rick in the Eastern Pacific became an extremely powerful Category 5 hurricane on Saturday, the first in the region since 2002's Hurricane Kenna. Rick had winds of 180 mph (285 km/h), making it the second-strongest East Pacific tropical cyclone on record, but has since weakened slightly.The storm is currently situated about 500 miles south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas, and is moving west-northwestward. Forecasters say Rick will eventually take a turn towards the northeast, bringing it towards the southern Baja California Peninsula of Mexico. Officials advise residents throughout the region to keep a close eye on the storm's progress over the coming days. The storm formed just a few days ago, and quickly grew to an extremely dangerous Category 5 cyclone. "Rick is probably going to go into the record books as one of the most rapidly intensifying hurricanes," said Hugh Cobb, a National Hurricane Center forecaster. Rick is the seventeenth named storm of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season.The core of Hurricane Rita made landfall just west of the Texas–Louisiana border as a category 3 storm at 3 AM Saturday with sustained winds near 120 mph.  The center of the eye crossed the coast southeast of Beaumont, Texas, near Sabine Pass, with the eyewall extending into Louisiana.Rita is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 8–12 inches, with the storm slowing down and producing a total of as much as 25 inches across eastern Texas and western Louisiana.  Bursts of tropical storm winds and rainfall amounts of 3–5 inches are possible in New Orleans.New Orleans' Ninth Ward, which saw as much as 20 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina, is currently in waist high water as a nearby levee was overtopped. Water is spilling over the levee in a section 100 feet wide.  There are reports of damage or leakage at three levee breaches.Near the center of the storm, coastal storm surge flooding of 15 feet above normal tide levels is expected, reaching 20 feet in bays and rivers. Tides are about 2 feet above normal along the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama coasts, and tides will increase to 4–6 feet above normal, with large waves and swells.Hurricane Rita weakened to become a category 3 storm on Friday with sustained winds of 125 mph.  The forecast path is centered near the Texas-Louisiana border.The core of the hurricane is expected to approach the Texas and Louisiana coasts late on Friday.Rita is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 8-12 inches, with the storm slowing down and producing a total of as much as 25 inches across eastern Texas and western Louisiana.  Bursts of tropical storm winds and rainfall amounts of 3-5 inches are possible in New Orleans.The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimated that 6 inches of rainfall could breach the previously damaged levees. New Orleans' Ninth Ward, which saw as much as 20 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina, is currently in waist high water as a nearby levee was overtopped. Water is spilling over the levee in a section 100 feet wide.Near the center of the storm, coastal storm surge flooding of 15 feet above normal tide levels is expected, reaching 20 feet in bays and rivers.News of 3 levee breaches in New Orleans are being broadcast in televised reports.  Tides are about 2 feet above normal along the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama coasts, and tides will increase to 4-6 feet above normal, with large waves and swells.A hydrofoil and a cargo ship have entered into collision this evening, at around 18:15 Italian local time (17:15 UTC) near the harbor of Messina, Sicily, Italy.The hydrofoil, named "Segesta jet", was doing a regular passenger service from Reggio Calabria to Messina, carrying 151 passengers and 6 crew members.The cargo ship is reported to be the "Susan Borchard", registered in Antigua and Barbuda.The number of people dead or injured is not currently established, but during the night the number of fatalities rose to 4.The Ayles ice shelf, which is more than 11,000 football fields in size and is located just south of the North Pole, has broken free in the Canadian Arctic. Scientists say that global warming has played a "major" role in the break.The entire 41 square miles of the shelf broke away from Ellesmere Island at least 16 months ago, and the break was discovered when a satellite took pictures of the region recently."This is a dramatic and disturbing event. It shows that we are losing remarkable features of the Canadian North that have been in place for many thousands of years. We are crossing climate thresholds, and these may signal the onset of accelerated change ahead," said Warwick Vincent, a Laval University scientist who studies conditions in the Arctic.Higher temperatures are believed to have played a significant role in the break, and all 6 shelves in the Canadian Arctic have become at least 90% smaller since they were discovered in the early 1900's."It [the break] is consistent with climate change. We aren't able to connect all of the dots, but unusually warm temperatures definitely played a major role," added Vincent.Seismographs detected the break and collapse of the shelf in August of 2005. The short amount of time it took for the event to occur has come as a surprise to scientists."What surprised us was how quickly it happened. Even 10 years ago scientists assumed that when global warming changes occur that it would happen gradually, so that perhaps we expected these ice shelves just to melt away quite slowly. It's pretty alarming," said head of the University of Ottawa's global ice lab, Luke Copland.A volcanic eruption started yesterday in south Iceland at or near the Eyjafjallajökull glacier.  The first signs of the eruption were seen between 23:00 and midnight GMT. It is still not clear where the exact location of the eruption is but it appears to be on Fimmvörðuháls.People living in the area are  being evacuated. Police have closed the roads into the area and a state of emergency has been declared. The eruption is expected to result in flooding if it is under the glacier, but fortunately it appears to between Eyjafjallajökull and another glacier, Mýrdalsjökull, reducing the danger of flooding. It is reported that the eruption can be seen as far away as from Vestmannaeyjar. So far the lava flow is viscous and thick.There is also a danger that this eruption could trigger another eruption on nearby Mt. Katla, which is an off-rift volcano beneath Mýrdalsjökull. In the past, eruptions at Eyjafjallajökull have triggered eruptions at Mt. Katla. If Katla does erupt, the effect would be far more significant than that of the current eruption, as lava could melt the ice at the top of the mountain, causing the potential for massive flooding.The air carrier Icelandair has diverted flights which were destined for Iceland as a precaution, due to the risks to aircraft of flying into volcanic ash.  A notice to airlines prohibits flights within 120 nautical miles of the volcano.Iceland is a volcanic island situated atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the juncture of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates.People studying the situation in Myanmar are claiming that an inadequate response of the government of Myanmar (formerly Burma) to scientists' warnings about the cyclone, coupled with large-scale destruction of protective mangroves along its coasts, aggravated the devastation wreaked by tropical Cyclone Nargis.The cyclone has killed an estimated 22,980 people so far, with millions rendered homeless by the disaster, which struck the Irrawaddy Delta region of Myanmar last week (3 May).Scientists at the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in New Delhi, the World Meteorological Organisation's specialist centre for Asia, say they issued the first of the cyclone bulletins to Myanmar as early as 26 April. Mrityunjay Mohapatra, director of IMD's cyclone-warning centre, told SciDev.Net that Myanmar was warned of the impending cyclone at least 48 hours in advance. But there was no acknowledgement from Myanmar's meteorological office, or any indication of a response.Mohapatra says IMD's first warning bulletin, issued on 1 May, indicated the land area likely to be hit by the cyclone. It warned that a cyclone with wind speeds of 180 kilometres per hour would cross the southwest coast of Myanmar sometime between 8pm and midnight on the night of the 2 May.IMD's bulletins contain information on the actual and predicted centre, intensity and movement of the cyclone, as well as sea conditions and maximum wind speeds around the cyclone centre.Uma Charan Mohanty, from the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre in Thailand, said that, according to the World Meteorological Organisation's data, Asian cyclones are fewer and less intense than hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean or typhoons in the Pacific Ocean region, but they cause more death and destruction. In 2005, 25 hurricanes in the Atlantic caused 10 deaths, but cyclone Sidr, which hit Bangladesh in 2007, left 3,500 dead.Mohanty says that the Atlantic coast has a good early-warning system and people have the means to drive to safer areas. In contrast, Asian coasts are densely populated, with many poor fishing and farming communities who cannot evacuate on their own, even if they have been warned.News agencies quote Maung Swe, Myanmar's minister for relief and resettlement, who told a press conference (6 May) that most deaths were caused by a 3.5-metre-high storm surge — a wall of water that develops when cyclonic winds churn up sea water.Mohanty says that 85 per cent of cyclone deaths are due to storm surges and that predictions of the size and location of such surges are critical in disaster forecasting.Asian coasts are also becoming increasingly vulnerable because of the loss of protective mangrove forests that serve as windbreaks and limit damage by storm and tidal surges.In a 2006 report, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that areas in Sri Lanka with mangrove forests suffered less damage in the 2004 Asian tsunami, compared with regions where forests had been destroyed.And in January 2008, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warned that Asia is fast losing its coastal mangroves, with more than 1.9 million hectares being destroyed each year.The organisation's report reviewed the world's mangroves between 1980 and 2005. It found that the mangrove forests around Myanmar's Irrawady Delta had degraded because of "overexploitation" and the conversion of land for rice fields — promoted by the government as a way to ensure self-sufficiency in food production.Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of the country.The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.Bindeez beads, a children's toy from Australia and manufactured by Moose Enterprise in Hong Kong, is being pulled off toy store shelves in the United Kingdom after traces of an illegal drug, which is converted into gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) when ingested, was found inside the toy. At least 20 million toys are affected.So far at least three children from the U.K. and at least two from Auckland, New Zealand have fallen seriously ill and are currently receiving medical attention. The toy is also sold in the United States as Aqua Dots, with two reports received by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) of children needing hospitalization after ingesting the beads."We've asked all our customers to take them off the shelf while we retest everything to make sure the toys comply with all regulations," said the company in a statement, although no mandatory recall has been issued for the product. The statement also says that the plant in Hong Kong was not using a chemical mixture approved by the company."This substitution was not at any time approved by Moose nor was Moose made aware of any substitution by the supplier," added the statement.The toys were supposed to contain a non-toxic chemical known as 1,5-pentanediol, but instead 1,4-butanediol, which is mainly used in creating the illegal drug GHB, was used in the toys. When humans consume 1,4-butanediol, the body converts it into GHB and could make the individual seriously ill, causing headaches, seizures, dizziness and in some cases death. GHB is a natural chemical found in a variety of things such as beef, wine and some varieties of citrus fruits. It is also used as a pharmaceutical which is sold as Xyrem.Recent animal research indicates that drugs are available for human use which may work as antidotes to the poison, either by hindering its conversion to GHB with 4-methylpyrazole (fomepizole, Antizol) or by blocking GHB's effectiveness at the receptor (SCH 50911).  Rodent testing has found the lethal dose of 1,4-butanediol to range from 1.4 to 2.5 grams per kilogram body weight, but an antidote can increase the lethal dose by a factor of 10.It is not known how the chemicals got mixed up, but officials for the toy company say that they are continuing the investigation. The toy is currently banned in all of Australia, but the company says all those who bought it will be refunded their money."The issue of how a dangerous substance was used in these beads and not the non-toxic substance ... that is going to take us a few more days to uncover," said Australia's Fair Trade Minister, Linda Burney in a statement to the press.The toy was recently named Australia's number one toy for 2007.The Illinois Department of Transportation and Illinois State Police have begun a statewide campaign to reduce the number of road fatalities in Illinois this year by 100. The program began last Thursday and will continue until the end of the year.There were 1,043 road fatalities in Illinois last year, and this year officials want that figure to be at 943 or less. If successful, the state will have experienced the fewest road fatalities since 1921. Organizations and advocacy groups throughout the state are encouraging citizens to promote public awareness of unsafe driving practices, such as driving while impaired, distracted, or unbelted. In addition to saving lives, the program is also aimed at reducing the costs associated with car crashes. According to the National Safety Council, the average economic cost associated with a road fatality is $1 million.More than 400 law enforcement agencies throughout the state are being asked to enhance operations and provide weekly activity and crash reports. The Itasca Police Department, for example, has joined the initiative and will target DUI and seat belt violations, and the Ottawa Police Department will increase enforcement of driving laws by issuing citations to violators.The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reports that an estimated number of sixteen million people may soon suffer from food shortages in the Sahel region. UNICEF prepares for a worst case scenario of providing food for 1.5 million children with acute malnutrition.The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs announced that by Tuesday the United Nations had so far only received about a quarter of the US$1 billion required for the imminent food crisis; the United Nations had appealed to the international community for donations.The situation is further complicated by Tuareg separatists in Mali, which are a security risk to the charities and have displaced residents to other states of the Sahel, as well as by workers in Niger, who have returned from Libya or Nigeria, but found no occupation in Niger. The government of Niger has initiated a program for this group consisting of relief food aid and labor schemes."We witnessed last year the situation spiraling out of control in East Africa as the aid community failed to act swiftly," explained Mamadou Biteye, the regional director of Oxfam for West Africa: "The worst can be avoided and thousands of lives will be saved if we act now. It's that simple."The last food crises were the 2011 East Africa drought in the Horn of Africa and the 2010 Sahel famine.A week ago today, at 2:46 pm JST, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off the coast of the Tōhoku region in Japan. The earthquake created an extremely destructive tsunami that spawned 10 metre (33 ft) high waves just moments later. The tsunami travelled 10 km (6 mi) inland causing massive destruction in the country's northeast, including crippling a nuclear plant.The earthquake and resulting tsunami have left 5,692 dead and over 9,506 missing, with nearly 450,000 homeless. The death toll is expected to rise.In this special photoessay, Wikinews looks at the earthquake and tsunami, the destruction that resulted and efforts to bring aid to the Japanese people.30 December 2004 (Updated 0920 CET)Indian government issued today a tsunami warning after a new earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richters scale. Indian citizens fled the area warned. Tsunamis are associated with quakes larger than 7.5 on the Richters scales. It should not be a surprise nothing happened today. The catastrophic quake that caused the fatal tsunamis was measured to 9 on the same scale. 7,000 Indian citizens are confirmed dead after the first quake.In Thailand, rumours about a new Tsunami is causing panic among the several thousand already injured.An Indian Air Force (IAF) MI-17 helicopter crashed into the Chenab river in the Doda district on Friday, after it got caught into a cable fire of a bridge. The occupants of the chopper are not yet known.The chopper was returning from the Nawapachi of Kishtawar district after supplying ammunition, food and arms for the troops there. The IAF regularly carries such duties to the area.The chopper was hovering low over the water body when it got caught in a cable fire and crashed into the Baglihar hydro-electric power project at Tringel. The chopper went deep into the water, and the exact number of people on board is not known, although police officers said that at least one of them died.There were two helicopters, as said by a police officer, and the second one was still hovering over the area when the first one crashed. Rescue teams were soon dispatched, and Pakistani troops are also on the way to assist with rescue efforts.A jet trainer belonging to the Indian Air Force (IAF) caught fire during takeoff from Biju Patnaik Airport in Orissa after refuelling and crashed. The pilot escaped unharmed.The aircraft was one of four flying from Kalaikunda airbase in West Bengal to Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh. They had made a scheduled stop at Biju Patnaik for refuelling. After this was completed, three of the aircraft successfully took off and continued, but the fourth caught fire and crashed on the runway at about 11:30 a.m. IST (UTC+5:30).The aircraft was a Surya Kiran aerobatics demonstration team display jet.The pilot ejected from the aircraft and was uninjured, whilst the aircraft was attended by Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting vehicles.An Air India Express airliner crashed last night in Mangalore, India, killing an estimated 160 people after a flight from Dubai.According to reports, the plane, a Boeing 737, crashed after landing and overshot the runway, coming to a stop in a forested valley before exploding.  According to the airline, a total of 166 people were on board the plane, 160 passengers and six crew. One of the seven survivors said that a tire on the plane had exploded as it was landing and "[w]ithin three seconds there was a fire blast. The inside was filled with smoke."The cause of the crash is not yet known, though pilot error is presumed to be responsible. The pilot of the aircraft, a Serbian with around 10,000 hours of experience, had made no distress call before the crash.  Visibility was also said to be good; the head of India's airport authority said that "visibility was six kilometres (four miles) when the aircraft approached the runway which was more than sufficient."  Light rain was falling at the time of the crash.Another survivor said that there had been no warning before the plane crashed.  "Immediately on touching the ground, the aircraft jerked and in a few moments hit something.  Then it split in the middle and caught fire. I just jumped from the gap."An Air India official said that "[a]s far as the information available with us is concerned, eight persons were rescued and shifted to local hospitals in Mangalore for treatment."  He also said that one of these people, reportedly a seven-year-old boy, had died while being taken to a hospital.  A police official said that around 120 bodies have been recovered so far, some with severe burns.Rescue workers had difficulty reaching the site of the crashed plane, as the valley is bordered by steep slopes, and heavy smoke hindered their progress.The airport the aircraft had been attempting to land at is considered a challenging one, as it is on a flat plateau bordered by a valley.  A former official from India's aviation ministry said that "Mangalore is a difficult field because it is on a plateau.  From all accounts the visibility was all right. One can’t make any conclusions."Families of the people killed in the crash will be compensated 200,000 Rupees (about $4,260 USD), while families of survivors will be compensated 50,000 rupees (about $1,064 (USD). All of the money will be provided by the government of India.This crash is the first significant crash of a passenger jet in India since July 17, 2000, when 51 people on board a Boeing 737 were killed as it crashed into buildings during an attempt to land at an airport in the city of Patna.A military helicopter crashed in Jammu and Kashmir today. Two people, believed to be the pilots, are dead.Both bodies are too burned for immediate identification. The Dhruv caught fire after going down in a forest in Bandipora. The crash at around 7:43p.m. local time was during night training over Ganderbal. Search and rescue personnel reached the wreckage in the Laman/Safapora forest at around 9:00p.m.The army, police, and fire service all attended. Night flights have been a routine fixture in the area, according to locals. "There was a huge noise which was followed by smoke and flames," according to witnesses. Rescuers were due to check for further victims.Manufactured by PSU Hindustan Aeronautics in India, more than 140 Dhruvs are in service nationally. They have suffered a string of setbacks, with four previous crashes across the country since 2011 killing a total of fourteen. The army says their weight is too high and their engines too underpowered for some roles. Ecuador has seven Dhruvs which are on reduced duties following accidents.A court in Gujarat, India has convicted 31 Hindus of murdering 33 Muslims during a race riot by burning down the building they were sheltering in. The convicts were given life sentences, while lack of evidence saw more than 40 others cleared.The case dates back to 2002, when a train caught fire and 60 Hindus died. Muslims were blamed and Hindus seeking revenge rioted in predominantly Muslim areas. Over 1,000 died, mostly Muslims. 28 died inside a house in Sardarpura, Mehsana which was torched whilst they sought refuge inside it, with five more dying later from injuries sustained.Since then, the tale has had many legal twists.Gujarat's local government launched an inquiry which declared the train fire was the culmination of "conspiracy" and fueled by 140 litres of petrol, and cleared the state's Hindu Chief Minister Narendra Modi — who had faced accusations of complicity in the ensuing riots — of wrongdoing. A federal government probe followed, reaching the conclusion the railway fire was unintentional and probably sparked by a cooking accident as Hindu pilgrims returned from Ayodhya. Ayodhya, too, has seen large race riots against Muslims after a breakaway group of Hindus destroyed a mosque in 1992 . Thousands died.The Supreme Court got involved in 2003. The court ruled Gujarat had failed to provide a suitable criminal response. Nine cases were ordered to be fast-tracked, including the Sardarpura fire case. A Special Investigating Team was formed at the court's direction. Two of the accused have died in the course of the trial, with the convictions following guilty verdicts in February on 31 suspects accused of murdering the train fire victims; 63 were exonerated by the court.As well as murder, the 31 Hindus have been convicted of attempted murder, arson, rioting, and criminal conspiracy. They can appeal.Tens of thousands have been displaced and at least 25 people killed in southern India due to torrential rains and heavy flooding during the last week.According to officials in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, almost 100,000 people have been forced to leave their homes due to severe weather, with 95,000 people in government-run relief camps. The districts of Visakhapatnam, East and West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur and Khammam were hardest hit. So far, 25 people have died in the state as a result of the torrential rains and heavy flooding. An additional 15 people were killed in the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu.The weather has significantly disrupted normal life as well as traffic. When the flood waters recede, farmers in the region may also see that almost all their crops were destroyed by the flooding."The unseasonal rainfall has destroyed our crops and our entire field is submerged in water," says Arku Rajaipa, a farmer in Gunthur district. He also said that his family would be forced to rely on the government for food for the rest of the year.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has offered federal support for the affected areas and contacted the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee has been taken to a Delhi Army Hospital after being injured in a car mishap in West Bengal. His condition is said to be stable. He has received injuries on the head and other body parts. In statement, he said he would be back at work soon: "I am well but doctors have advised me 48 hours rest. I hope to be back to work after that period," the Press Trust of India reported. Mukherjee is one of the senior most politicians in the ruling Congress Party and is close to party supremo Sonia Gandhi. In a cabinet reshuffle in October last year, Mukherjee had been given the high profile post of India's foreign minister which was lying vacant after the resignation of Natwar Singh. Until then he had been the minister for defence. In view of this accident Mukherjee's two day visit to Saudi Arabia where he was expected to call upon the Saudi king has been cancelled.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh received Mukherjee at the airport when he was brought back from West Bengal.One year on from the Indian Ocean tsunami, the world's grief and compassion returned to the tsunami-battered coastlines of the Indian Ocean, where at least 216 000 people lost their lives. Under a clear sky and before a gentle sea, the world commemorated those lost their lives, in one of the worst natural disasters that the modern world has experienced.Since the Indian Ocean tsunami,  patchy progress has been made on the return to a normal life for those who lived through the experience.  Efforts to implement a warning system similar to that coordinated by  the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii have past a number of significant milestones.  Tourist resorts in many places have been rebuilt, and many visiting them at this time do so as a form of remembrance. Yet still there remain those who may never recover from the tragic events of one year ago. Some $13 billion was pledged to relief and recovery efforts, of which 75 percent has already been secured.At least four people died and forty were injured Saturday night as the result of a stage collapsing at the Indiana State Fair, located within the US state of Indiana. The Indianapolis Star has attributed the incident to poor weather. A storm with wind speeds as high as 60 miles per hour (96 kilometres per hour) had been reported.Captain Brad Weaver, an Indiana State Police employee, described witnessing "the framework from the stage start to come over", having given a public safety announcement shortly prior to the collapse. Numerous patients, including adults and children, have been admitted to hospital. Weaver claimed that the incident could not have been prevented. Video footage of the incident, which has now emerged online, displays witnesses screaming as the rigging falls down.One witness, who has been identified only as Chris, informed the BBC of the events he sighted. "We could see the sky get really dark and there was lightening and thunder. It almost seemed like a hurricane hit out of nowhere. The stage just leaned to the right and crashed down. It felt to me like it was in slow motion. Everyone was scrambling and it was horrifying because you knew people were underneath it." He described the incident as "the worst thing I have witnessed in my life." David Lindquist, a journalist for The Indianapolis Star, described the scenario as "bad, very bad", and that one "could clearly see people were under the footprint of the rigging." Freeing trapped victims from underneath the wreckage took rescue workers under twenty minutes, according to Lindquist. No performers were left injured.A Twitter account representing the Indiana State Fair confirmed the fatalities and stated that their "prayers are with the families of all affected". At the time of the incident — approximately 2100 EST Saturday night or 0000 UTC Sunday morning — US country music band Sugarland were about to perform. Band members Kristian Bush and Jennifer Nettles spoke out after the accident on social networking website Twitter. They said: "We are all right. We are praying for our fans, and the people of Indianapolis. We hope you'll join us. They need your strength."Sara Bareilles, another scheduled performer at the event, also commented on Twitter. Bareilles said she was "speechless" and felt "hopeless" in the aftermath of the situation. "Please send love and prayers to Indianapolis tonight. My heart aches for the lives lost."A Seymour, Indiana high school freshman is recovering after a lighting strike Thursday during practice, with no storm in sight.  The lightning strike hit Emily Bobb, and injured three of her teammates. Bobb was transported to Indianapolis Riley Hospital for Children, and the others were taken to a medical facility in Seymour.Dr. Levi Nehrtt was working across the street at a nearby chiropractic and physical therapy clinic, when he saw the lighting strike Bobb.  He immediately ran across the street and jumped the fence, and began CPR.  EMT’s arrived within minutes and transported Bobb to the hospital.On Friday Bobb was listed in good condition, from her initial critical condition.  Her teammates were treated and released from the hospital.The National Weather Service warns that lighting strikes can happen with virtually no warning.  According to the National Weather Service statistics lightning has claimed the lives of 90 persons in Indiana since 1959.A tornado with winds up to 300 km/h has killed at least 19 in Indiana and Kentucky. The tornado touched down at around 2.00 AM local time on the 6th of November in northern Kentucky and then crossed the Ohio River into southern Indiana near Evansville, Indiana where the majority of casualties were reported. "At least five people were confirmed dead in Warrick County and at least 18 were killed in Vanderburgh County, according to county officials."Peak storm season for the region is generally April through June - a storm of this ferocity is quite rare at this time of year, according to the National Storm Prediction Centre.The death toll varies between sources, but between 19 and 23 is the current estimate, with most of those in Indiana.Indonesia has been angered by a decision of the European Union to leave all 51 of the nation's air carriers on the list of air carriers banned in the EU. State-owned flag carrier Garuda Indonesia had hoped to begin flights to Europe imminently and has ordered ten new jetliners to serve routes there and to the United States.Transport ministry spokesperson Bambang Ervan said "This seems like an unfair punishment for Indonesia. The EU is not a sovereign country and is not a member of the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation). But we do respect the EU and its decision, and demand the same from the EU."The ban was imposed after a string of accidents, of which the three most important were Adam Air Flight 574, a 102-fatality accident in which a Boeing 737-43Q plunged into the ocean after pilots distracted by instrument failure failed to maintain control, Adam Air Flight 172, in which another B737 snapped in half after a hard landing and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, in which a third B737 attempted landing at extreme speed and overshot the runway, killing 21.Adam Air had also almost suffered a B737 crash the previous year, 2006, after a similar navigational instrument failure to that on Flight 574 caused the airliner to become lost for several hours, eventually performing an emergency landing hundreds of kilometres from its intended destination. Indonesia grounded the carrier in March after another accident in which a B737 overshot a runway. The carrier is also in severe financial difficulties and may soon be permanently shut down.Meanwhile, the pilot of Garuda 200 has been charged over the accident, sparking intense controversy.The EU reviewed the ban this week, but ruled that those responsible "have still to demonstrate that they have completed the corrective actions" needed to lift the ban. It is a blow to Indonesia, who had promised "fast-track" help to Garuda, Mandala Airlines, Premiair and Airfast to raise their safety to levels acceptable to the EU.MV Teratai Prima, a 700-ton Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers onboard, was struck by tropical cyclone Charlotte and sank at about 4 a.m. Sunday 30 miles (50 kilometers) off Majene, western Sulawesi. Majene district police head Adj. Sr. Comr. Suyatmo said that more than 260 people are missing and feared dead.The ferry was bound for Samarinda, East Kalimantan, from Pare-Pare, South Sulawesi. Samarinda is the capital of the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan (Kalimantan Timur) on the island of Borneo. Sulawesi (formerly known as Celebes, ˈsɛlɛbiz) is one of the four larger Sunda Islands of Indonesia and is situated between Borneo and the Maluku Islands. Majene is a town in West Sulawesi and it is the seat (capital) of Majene Regency.According to Transport Minister Jusman Syafi'i Djamal, 150 people jumped off the ship before it sank. The captain, Basir, who also survived the maritime tragedy, was under investigation for ignoring weather warnings. "There's a tropical cyclone now which caused tides of 13-foot-high (4-meter-high) to six metres," Djamal said. "At least 22 people — 18 passengers and four crew members — were rescued from the sea by fishermen before the military launched a search operation at daybreak Monday," he added. The survivors were saved by fishermen who found them drifting on three life rafts, according to Taufik.File:Fotopresdn.jpgAccording to the captain, the 1999 ferry was inspected by the Transport Ministry on December 9 and was certified to be in good condition. "It seems that due to the weather conditions the chance is little, but we still hope," Djamal stated. With 17 crew members, and carrying 200 tons of cargo, the ill-fated PT Nur Budi owned and operated ferry sank so fast that the crew "had no chance to ask the passengers to wear life jackets.""President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has instructed the National Search and Rescue Agency to continue searching for survivors," Jusman announced on Monday. "The Indonesian Navy has prepared three warships while the Air Force has prepared a Boeing 737 to help with evacuation," he added.The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. "The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible," he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday.It specifically stated that "Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves," but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.Col. Jaka Santosa reported that they found not one survivor amid hours of rescue operations in the treacherous waters of Makassar Strait, the same maritime site where 102 passengers perished on board an Adam Air plane which crashed on New Year's Day in 2007.Three warships, an airplane and a helicopter with Search and Rescue (SAR) vessels on Monday searched waters off Sulawesi's west coast. According to Col. Jaka Santosa and Rear Admiral Iskandar Sitompul, the rescue operations were hindered by driving rain, strong winds and giant waves of up to 13 feet (4 meters). "Two warships and one Nomad patrol aircraft from the navy are off West Sulawesi scouring for survivors. A team of 40 marines with two rubber boats are also involved in the search this morning," Sitompul said. "Eight patrol boats from provincial search and rescue teams are already in the area, and the navy as well as the air force are also involved in today's search," Djamal added.According to Rustam Pakaya, head of the health ministry's crisis centre, six fatalities had already been confirmed on Monday. "There is a greater possibility that many more died than we expected because it happened when they were sleeping," Taufik Bulu, head of maritime safety in the port of Pare-Pare, explained.The Indonesian archipelago is composed of more than 17,000 islands and has a population of 235 million. Ferry accidents are common in the island nation of Indonesia, where the fleet is largely old and overcrowded. In July 2005 about 200 died when a ferry capsized off eastern Indonesia. In December 2006, more than 638 perished when an overloaded Indonesian ship also sank in the Java Sea (between Borneo and Java) amid a turbulent storm. Only 250 people survived. In July 2007, 70 also perished in a ferry tragedy off eastern Indonesia, while at least 42 passengers perished when fire broke out aboard a boat that was heading from Jakarta to Bangka island off Sumatra in February 2007. In May, another ferry with about 800 passengers on board caught fire. It had no firefighting equipment, forcing evacuation of passengers by the Indonesian Navy. In late September, at least nine perished after another Indonesian ferry burned and sank.Indonesia has suspended the operating license of PT Adam Skyconnection Airlines, who trade as Adam Air, over safety concerns. The airline has recently suffered safety problems and financial difficulty.Formed in 2003, Adam Air hit financial crisis on Monday when two major shareholders, investment companies who control 50% of the airline, announced they were pulling out and selling all shares back to the original owners, who still control the other half. The reasons given were a lack of improvement in safety and alleged financial mismanagement.The shares were bought after two major accidents hit the budget carrier last year. On New Year's day Adam Air Flight 574 disapeared and was found to have crashed into the ocean near Sulawesi, leaving 102 missing and presumed dead. Shortly afterwards, another company aircraft snapped in half during landing, but fatalities were prevented because the compromised airframe held together. Both were Boeing 737 (B737) aircraft. At the airline's height, it operated 22 of these, serving domestic routes across the Indonesian archipelago and daily international flights to Malaysia and Singapore.Adam Air also had a serious incident in early 2006, when all navigational systems on a B737 failed, causing the plane to inadvertently enter an accident blackspot. The aircraft was lost for several hours before performing an emergency landing hundreds of miles from its intended destination.On March 10, another Adam Air B737 overshot the runway during landing at Batam island's airport. Since then, Adam Air has been issued two deadlines in rapid succession by the authorities - one to solve safety issues, and one to prove its financial viability. They have cut routes from 52 to 12, and defaulted on all payments on their aircraft to the leasing companies, who have seized back 12 of them.Gustiono Kustianto, director of one of the two leasing companies, said the carrier's "life expectancy is less than a month," and that it owes US$14 million to leasing companies compared to $4.8 million of free capital.Aviation director general Budhi Mulyawan Suyitno said that Adam Air had been grounded due to inadequate Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) standards and poor pilot training. He said that investigations into last week's crash, which injured five people and severely damaged the aircraft, had revealed "the pilot had no idea what to do in an emergency situation." The airline will spend three months grounded, after which it will be shut down entirely if it does not show it has improved."The Transport Ministry has decided to revoke Adam Air's operational specification, effective 12am Wednesday (4am AEDT), said Suyitno. "With this, Adam Air is banned from operating its aircraft. All of its planes must be automatically grounded." He commented that a quarterly evaluation had uncovered "violations that could put passengers' safety at risk".The news coincides with a two-day ultimatum from Adam Air's insurance provider. Failure to pay the insurance premiums would also have resulted in grounding.Founder Adam Suherman - whose family owns half the airline alongside Sandra Ang - commented today that the situation with the shareholders had demoralised pilots. "That in turn would affect their performance. It is very dangerous." He also said that he was not surprised Adam Air had been grounded. Yesterday, he said that there were no plans to file for bankruptcy.His immediate reaction to the news from the insurance - which preceded the grounding by several hours - was that his airline likely could not insure the entire fleet, saying "There have been warnings from the insurance companies... Because every aircraft that is in operation must be insured, the operational activities will be temporarily suspended until there is a further decision from shareholders."Adam Air's 2007 accidents, coupled with Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, sparked an industry review that determined none of the nation's air carriers were safe. The United States subsequently warned against using Indonesian airlines, and they were all added to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.Seeking to stave off the forest fires that have blanketed five Southeast Asian countries with choking haze for the past two years, Indonesian environmental and forestry officials said yesterday they would be able to reduce the number of hot spots this year by more than half.Meeting in Jambi, Sumatra, cabinet ministers from Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand heard what Indonesia plans to do this year to combat the illegal forest fires, which start each year during the August-November dry season."We are targeting a drop of about 50 percent in forest fires but we are entering the dry season between July and August so we have to increase our alertness," Indonesian deputy environment minister Masnellyarti Hilman was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse. "We explained the efforts that we've taken to prevent a repeat of the choking haze...and they praised our efforts," he said.A statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said Indonesia's efforts would reduce the number of hot spots by 58 percent from the previous year.Caused by slash-and-burn cultivation on palm oil and timber plantations on Borneo and Sumatra, the haze has covered parts of the affected countries for the past two years. It was first problematic in 1997, due to the El Niño weather pattern.Indonesia has shut down four airlines and grounded five others with the potential of similar licence revocations for failing to meet safety standards.The largest company to lose its licence is Jatayu Gelang Sejahtera. The other companies are all small airlines operating only aircraft with a passenger capacity of fewer than thirty, and are Aviasi Upataraksa, Alfa Trans Dirgantara and Prodexim. The companies that were grounded pending either improvements or licence revokation are Germania Trisila Air, Atlas Delta Setia, Survey Udara Penas, Kura-kura Aviation and SMAC, all of which also operate only aircraft with under-30 passenger capacities. They have three months to improve, or their licences will be revoked.Jatayu had already ceased operations in August, but had intended to restart with a 150-seat Boeing 737. The licence was revoked because the state requires at least two aircraft to be commercially operated and because of the fact that it "was lacking in pilots and human resources". Also, the age of the jetliner meant that it would require a test called a 'C-Check' before it could begin commercial services, at a cost of $120,000.The action comes as the result of a number of air crashes, namely the Adam Air Flight 574 disaster in which 102 people were killed, and the Adam Air Flight 172 accident, in which a plane snapped in half during a hard landing, but managed to hold together, thus preventing any serious injuries. As a result, all 54 of Indonesia's airlines were given a safety rating, with a level-1 rating meaning no action was needed, a level-2 rating meaning the airline needed to make some improvements, and a level-3 rating requiring that the airline be shut down unless improvements were made within three months. Most airlines received a level-2 rating, while none received the top rating. Adam Air was among the airlines to receive the level-3 rating, but was upgraded to tier 2 at the same time as the groundings.Meanwhile, state-owned Garuda Indonesia is now the only airline to have a type-1 rating, despite the fatal crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 in March. According to the Indonesian Transport Ministry's Director General for Aviation Budi Mulyawan Suyitno, Garuda now satisfied 84 percent of civil aviation standards.The ratings have been based on such criteria as surveillance, ramp checks, personnel, department safety, number of accidents and number of serious incidents, according to the BBC. Meanwhile, Flight Global is reporting that, according to Directorate General of Air Communications (DGAC) director of air certification office, Yurlis Hasibuan “20 criteria including whether the airline has developed [better] safety and human resources” are checked.An enormous mud-spewing volcano in East Java, Indonesia is to become the newest testing grounds for the human control of natural phenomena. In this instance, the natural phenomenon may actually be initiated through human activity. If so, the humans responsible for the disaster may eventually answer to the over 10,000 former residents of the land currently reduced the world's most unruly mud puddle.A consultant for the oil and gas industry is on record saying, "This is a natural disaster induced by drilling activity...Somehow, or somewhere, several mistakes occurred that caused the mud to come from the hole." Since its birth over eight months ago, the mud volcano has expelled as much as 126,000 cubic meters of mud per day. A recent publication of the Geological Society of America has concurred with the earlier assessment.The mud is not toxic, but it smells bad and reaches over 4 meters deep at some points. Entire villages have been filled by the mud flow. Management techniques for the disaster have included diverting the flow into the ocean, which has in turn produced anxieties regarding the potential of ecological damage to the ocean.In an attempt to check the deluge of hot mud, a recent (and contentious) intervention has been placed into motion: the volcano will be plugged. Although the plan seems cartoonish, Rudi Novrianto -- spokesman for the national mudflow disaster commission -- is on record saying, "We will insert high density chained balls inside the mud volcano. This technique is expected to reduce the amount of mud flow and ease the pressure at the source of the gushing."The obvious possibility of pressure buildup, and a secondary (and more violent) mud eruption, has been addressed. Richard Davies of Durham university is on record stating "...nobody has ever done this before...the pressure may build, forcing open other vents, possibly exacerbating the situation."On Saturday, a tsunami struck Indonesia's Sunda Strait coastline at around 21:30 local time (1430 UTC). Indonesian officals suggested it was caused by an undersea landslide that followed the recent eruptions of Anak Krakatoa, later receiving support from geological experts. The BBC reported on Sunday 222 dead and 843 injured, with Indonesian government officials saying the numbers were likely to rise further. NPR reported at least 281 killed; more recently The Guardian gave a minimum death toll of 373.  Early reports indicated the wave was about 3–7 feet (1–2 meters) high.  No earthquake accompanied it; victims had no warning before the surge arrived.On Sunday a tsunami warning siren went off accidentally, causing panic because of the false alarm. The affected area incorporates Java and Sumatra, the nation's most populous islands. The Sunda Strait forms a link between the Java Sea and the Indian Ocean.The International Federation of the Red Cross said on Sunday it was on the scene working to support survivors and locate the deceased. President Joko Widodo spoke of his sadness at the disaster. Three months ago a tsunami hit Sulawesi, causing thousands of deaths. A 2004 tsunami that hit thirteen nations killed over 220,000 with Indonesia the worst affected. The island nation is in an area of high tectonic activity known as the Ring of Fire, making earthquakes and tsunamis relatively common.Indonesia's President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, visited the area worst hit by the tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Java Monday afternoon. Mr Yudhoyono toured the small town of Pangandaran meeting people who were staying in a temporary camp.  Many of them are too scared to return home after the huge wave killed nearly 550 people. The tsunami was produced by an underwater earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale.At the camp, Mr Yudhoyono told one woman to "be strong". According to a relief worker, about 3,000 people have taken refuge at the site, but only about 500 of them have lost their homes. She said people are too scared to go home because they live on the coast, a sentiment shared by one woman who told AFP: "I did not lose my home, and my husband and child are safe, but we are still traumatised by the tsunami and are too afraid to return home in case another one comes."West Java Governor Danny Setiawan told journalists that officials are persuading people to return home, and he said a return to normality "could take five to six years".Aid workers are working to provide relief to the 15,500 people who have been left homeless as a result of the two-meter high wave. Yesterday, 15 tonnes of rice and 1,600 boxes of instant noodles were dropped, but some residents have said government assistance is necessary for them to regain their livelihoods. One woman told Reuters, "I don’t have anything, only 5,000 rupiah (£0.30, $0.55) in my wallet. The government should give us money to buy houses and a boat."It is estimated over 300 people are still missing, and the army and police are using helicopters, boats and mechanical diggers in the hope of recovering survivors. Lieutenant Colonel Tri Yuniarta has told his 350-strong rescue team in Pangandaran to finish collecting bodies trapped under debris by next Monday. The Indonesian government has been criticised for failing to inform residents that a tsunami was looming. After the underwater earthquake was detected, US and Japanese agencies issued warning notices, but the government has admitted it was unable to transmit the bulletins to coastal areas. Speaking yesterday, Mr Yudhoyono vowed to hasten efforts to build an early warning system planned after the 2004 Asian tsunami. "We want to expedite efforts to get infrastructure for the tsunami warning system in place," AP quoted him as saying. "I will work with parliament to get the budget".Survivors have described the tsunami, which struck a 200km stretch of Java's southern coast. A Belgian tourist said he was in a beach side bar when the wave hit. "I saw this big cloud of dark sea water coming up to me".Indonesia is situated on the Pacific Rim of Fire where 90% of the world's earthquakes and 81% of the world's largest earthquakes occur.Jusman Syafii Djamal, minister of transport for Indonesia, has recommended that local airlines should not purchase aircraft from European manufacturers, such as Airbus. It is a direct response to the decision of the European Union (EU) to add all 51 of Indonesia's air carriers to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.The EU made the decision to ban the Indonesian air traffic due to a string of accidents in the country, including two major disasters this year - the losses of Adam Air Flight 574 and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which killed 102 and 21 people respectively."We do not need to buy aircraft from Europe as long as the flying ban stays unrevoked," Detik.com quoted Djamal as saying, although Xinhua translated the quote as: "As long as the ban is still in place, it is better we do not buy [aircraft] from Europe." "If aircraft are purchased and registered as Indonesian [in Europe], we are worried the planes won't be able to fly to Indonesia because Indonesian airlines' aircraft are banned from flying over Europe," he continued. Djamal is concerned that instead new European planes would have to be flown into Indonesia prior to registration, with higher costs incurred as a result.The announcement, which had already been issued to airlines two weeks ago, was made at a joint press conference with Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla in Jakarta. Djamal told reporters that he felt the best option was the lifting of the ban. "The easiest way is to lift the ban, because the ban goes against the principle of open sky policy," he said.Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has already postponed a diplomatic visit to Europe, citing the ban as his reason. Normally, the president flies on an aircraft operated by state-owned national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia.A European Commission review was held in Brussels on November 28. Although bans were lifted on Pakistani flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines and Surinam carrier Blue Wing Airlines, the sanctions on Indonesian airlines remained in force.Multiple local air carriers are considering the possibility of fleet expansions, with some evaluating Airbus jets as possible options. Airbus, in particular, charge an added cost for taking an aircraft to Indonesia for registration. "There is an additional cost that must be paid by Indonesian airlines that buy the (Airbus) plane from Europe, US$200,000 ," said Djamal. "Because of that we recommend not buying planes from Europe. As long as the EU ban is still in place, there will be additional payment."However, he went on to say that should a manufacturer be willing to pay the cost itself, he did not object to the purchase of the aircraft. He has also confirmed that no Indonesian officers will be sent to Europe to assist with the situation.45 of Indonesia's 51 air carriers as well as some airport management companies signed a safety deal with the Indonesian government yesterday. The deal will be delivered to the European Commission  ahead of a November 19 meeting in Brussels to review the placement of all 51 of Indonesia's airlines on the list of air carriers banned in the EU in June after a string of aviation accidents earlier in the year. Indonesia is already planning to give a presentation on air safety improvements at the meeting.Under the deal, the airlines have promised to increase supervision of security and safety issues, while the government pledged to increase numbers and abilities of regulation staff. The deal comes a week after EU inspectors suggested that the airlines would benefit from increased safety standards and larger numbers of more highly trained management staff. Ultimately, the deal is intended to bring Indonesia fully up to the standards set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).This is a part of a serious effort by the operators and regulators to improve our aviation safety and meet international standards," Transport Minister Djusman Syafii Djamal told Radio Elshinta of Jakarta after the ceremonial signing of the document, adding hopes that the deal would cause the removal of the EU ban.The deal was arranged by the National Team for Transportation Safety and Security, which was set up to investigate Indonesia's failing transportation infrastructure, particularly the aviation sector. The six-man group was chaired by Marshal Chappy Hakim, a retired Air Force chief of staff. He told reporters that he felt "We need to work hard to prove we can meet international standards, and that starts with this declaration," The ban was orriginally placed after three accidents involving Indonesian airliners - the New Year's Day crash of Adam Air Flight 574, which killed 102 people, the subsequent accident involving Adam Air Flight 172, which cracked in half on a hard landing but held together, preventing serious injury, and the March crash of state-run Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which claimed 23 lives. All the accidents involved aging Boeing 737 aircraft.Indonesia has also since been the subject of regulatory action by the United States Federal Aviation Administration, who warned US citizens wishing to travel to use alternatives to Indonesian air carriers.Despite originally threatening a retaliatory ban on European airlines in Indonesian airspace, Indonesia quickly admitted to a poor safety record. Indonesia has since been taking steps recently to improve it's air safety, having already started ranking airlines on safety and signing a deal with the ICAO to set up an independent regulatory body and improve Air Traffic Control operations. Earlier this year, Indonesia shut down several airlines that it viewed as not meeting safety standards. A team from the European Aviation Security Agency has inspected Indonesian airports and interviewed the managers of Garuda Indonesia, Mandala Airlines and Air Fast to gauge how far safety has improved.The ICAO will evaluate Indonesia's progress in late 2008.A power outage in Indonesia that left about 100 million people without electricity has caused a political crisis.  The country's state-owned energy monopoly, PLN, has not determined the immediate cause, and the country's president has ordered the national intelligence agency and police to investigate.The blackout appears related to deficiencies in Indonesia's power generation capacity.The power failure follows attempts to deal with the country's growing energy crisis, including conservation and trying to allow private companies to provide energy, which was ruled unconstitutional in 2004.  In January, the Indonesian government held a special energy summit to attract investment in their energy infrastructure.  At the summit they set the goal of adding 22,000 megawatts to Indonesia's present capacity of 23,000 megawatts, in order to support the country's growth.The World Bank and others have warned that without more investment in the country's energy infrastructure an energy deficit will result. However, foreign investors remain wary of investing in Indonesia. "The power outage has resulted in worries over an energy crisis which could hurt the nation's industrial sector," said a trader on Indonesia's stock market.[1]The outage began at 10:23 a.m. local time, August 18, 2005, when power failed along the electrical system that connects Java, Bali, and Madura, causing outages in Java and Bali.  Almost half of the country depends on the electrical grid that experienced failures. Some of the main lines on the grid are over 20 years old, according to PLN president Eddie Widiono.The blackout caused traffic jams in Jakarta, forced cancellation of several international and domestic flights at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, shut down Jakarta's electric train service, and disrupted hospital operations.  Some larger hospitals were forced to delay surgeries while many smaller hospitals could not receive patients. About 1,800 officers were called into action by Jakarta's metropolitan police to deal with short-term problems caused by the power failure.Candles used in place of electric lighting started six fires in Jakarta alone.Mulyo Aji, a PLN official, said more power failures are likely in the future as energy demand increases, without any corresponding new supplies of electricity scheduled to come online soon.Captain Muhammad Marwoto Komar, the pilot who was controlling Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 when it crashed two years ago, has been jailed for two years. 21 people were killed when the Boeing 737 crashed at Adi Sucipto Airport in Yogyakarta.The court ruled that Article 479G(b) of the Criminal Code had been breached by Komar — negligence resulting in death. The aircraft had crashed due to the excessive speed that it landed at, with prosecutors originally claiming the crash was deliberate while Komar blamed an issue with the flaps. The charge of intentionally crashing was later dropped.The court found that as Komar had not notified co-pilot Gagam Salman R. or air traffic control of any issue with the aircraft despite having two minutes to do so he was negligent. Had the airport been aware of the problems on board, they could have readied Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting crews to prevent or contain the fire when the plane departed the runway. As the plane approached the runway the Ground Proximity Warning System sounded fifteen times to inform the flight crew the jet was going too fast for a safe landing.He was sentenced to two years in prison, half the term prosecutors were seeking. Lead prosecutor Mudin Aristo said that "we're considering [appealing] the verdict." M. Assegaf, Komar's lawyer, has already said that he will appeal. "The case should not have been tried under that article [479G(b)], which is used to regulate terrorists. Captain Marwoto is not a terrorist", said Assegaf. Garuda Pilots’ Association president Stephanus Gerardus and Napitupulu of the Federation of Indonesian Pilots both commented that the case should not have been in a criminal court at all but in an aviation court. Garardus commented that "Pilots will be afraid to land their planes because of the threat of imprisonment."The judges, who were split in their verdict as one felt that all charges should be dismissed, ruled that the position of such a court was unclear and that it had no jurisdiction to hand down jail sentences. They also said that Law No. 1/2009 on profession courts, which applies to such a court, was not in place at the time of the accident.Others felt that the sentence was too light. Then-Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer commented that "it seems a very light sentence frankly. I understand from the evidence that was presented that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the aircraft and that the pilot just landed the plane at far too high a speed, way over the limit of the landing of an aircraft." Five Australian diplomats and journalists travelling on flight 200 to attend a counter-terrorism conference that Downer appeared at in Indonesia were amongst the dead.Caroline Mellish, sister of Australian journalist Morgan Mellish who died on the flight, also said the sentence was light. "I don't feel like justice has been served... And hearing he only got two years made it even harder," she said. Kevin Keevil, father of AusAID's Allison Sudradjat, who also died, had a similar opinion."It does not give me any peace of mind," said Keevil. "I have a personal belief that the sentence is inadequate given what transpired on the day, especially in view of the pilot's behaviour."The verdict, which was attended by Komar's wife and teenage sons, garnered widespread public interest. For the four hours that proceedings lasted the courtroom was at capacity and many people were listening from outside.Indonesia's High Court in Yogyakarta has overturned the April conviction of a Garuda Indonesia pilot who was behind the controls in an air disaster. Captain Marwoto Komar was cleared of negligently causing the deaths of 21 when his Boeing 737 overshot the runway at Adisucipto Airport.The March 2007 crash occurred after the flight from Jakarta landed at excessive speed and a steep angle. The jet bounced down the runway before overshooting and coming to rest in a rice field, where it was destroyed by fire. Of the 140 on board, sixteen Indonesians and five Australians were killed.The court in Komar's trial had ruled that while it could not be shown for sure that the aircraft was mechanically sound with the Captain solely responsible for the dangerous landing, Komar had two minutes in which to inform air traffic control and his co-pilot Gagam Salman R. that they were experiencing an emergency. The court found that had he done so Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting equipment could have been mobilised ready for the incoming jet. The investigation by the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) found no mechanical defect and stated that fifteen activations of the Ground proximity warning system had been ignored, but international law made this inadmissible as evidence.The ruling was overturned in September, but has only just been published. The High Court ruled that the prosecution had failed to "legally and convincingly" demonstrate guilt and therefore "the defendant's rights, position and status should be restored." Komar received half of the four year sentence sought by prosecutors but avoided jail as he was freed on bail while the appeal was pending. Komar's lawyer Mochtar Zuhdi said the High Court decision was final and cannot be appealed.The decision to charge Captain Komar was highly controversial; the first time Indonesia prosecuted a pilot over a crash. Indonesia Air Traffic Controllers Association chief Adrie Gunawan said that 26 controllers left the country fearing possible prosecutions if anything went wrong on their shift; they also threatened to strike. Indonesian Pilots' Association chief Manotar Napitupulu said "This shows that the justice system has finally understood that Marwoto’s case did not belong in court." Last year Wikinews interviewed Paul McCarthy, an aviation lawyer and pilot who serves as the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations' representative to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. McCarthy said that prosecuting the man could have a chilling effect on people speaking to accident investigators, hence affecting safety. He also heavily criticised the investigation.Not everyone is pleased by the decision. Victims' families in Australia are upset and angry at the decision. The Sydney Morning Herald used a headline that stated "Ruling denies justice for Australian crash victims". "The fact he has had his conviction quashed and pilot status reinstated, it's like nothing's happened," said Caroline Mellish, whose brother Morgan was killed. Simone Kerr, who lost her sister in the disaster, said "My greatest fear is that he will be flying again. He needs to be held accountable for his actions... There is no justice in this world."Reports from Indonesia now say at least nine people were killed and over 200 rescued today, after a ferry sank in rough waters near Sumatra island.The Dumai Express 10 was sailing from Batam island to Dumai in Riau province on Sunday morning when it sank. Officials blamed bad weather for the accident, but there have been reports that the ferry was severely overloaded.Sunaryo, the director-general of sea transport, said the ferry's capacity was 273 people, and only 213 passengers were on the manifest, but one official put the number rescued at 292. Sunaryo said the large disparity between reality and the manifest was a "classic case" of breaking regulations.  Separately, another ferry, the Dumai Express 15 with 278 people on board, ran aground today after it was hit by large waves on its way from Batam to Moro island. Authorities say all passengers and crew survived.Indonesians rely heavily on ferries to transport them between the thousands of islands that make up the archipelago. Ferry accidents are common due to bad weather, poor infrastructure and a tendency to overload vessels. Around 800 people have been killed in ferry accidents in Indonesia over the past three years, including at least 232 in an accident off Sulawesi in January this year.A Casa-212 aircraft owned by the Indonesian air force disappeared while on a flight from the capital Jakarta to Bogor in West Java Friday morning.The plane was carrying 12 Indonesian military personnel and 6 civilians including a British, Singaporean and Indian national.The plane was tasked to test a new digital camera designed to conduct aerial mapping and topography.The aircraft was last sighted on radar in the Salak moutain region on the main island of Java, 90 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.The Indonesian military has deployed a search and rescue team in the area.Authorities fear that the aircraft crashed in a densely forested area making any rescue difficult.Air Force spokesman Chaeruddin Ray said the region was covered in thick fog and in a rough terrain.Three planes and forty people were deployed into the region to look for the downed plane.Indonesia has been plagued with several plane accidents resulting in a ban on the entry of Indonesian airlines into European airports. This is the second incident in Indonesian aviation involving a Casa-212. In January of 2008, a similar plane model owned by a private company also crashed.The Casa-212 is a design by Spanish avionics company Construcciones Aeronáuticas, a turbo-prop plane designed for a short take-off and landing.The Spanish company licensed an Indonesian avionics firm to assemble and manufacture this aircraft.On the 2nd of January, relatives waiting for news about the Adam Air jetliner broke down in tears after learning that senior Indonesian officials erroneously reported the Boeing 737's charred wreckage had been found and that a dozen people may have survived. A Boeing 737-400 flying for low-cost carrier Adam Air has crashed into the mountains of Indonesia's Sulawesi missing during its flight from Surabaya, Java to Manado, Sulawesi, Indonesia amid bad weather. The plane serving as flight number KI-574 was carrying 96 passengers and a crew of 6. The domestic flight disappeared and vanished off late Monday about an hour before the intended landing time. The captain managed to send out two distress signals, but contact was then lost. Before the ill-fated planed vanished from radar, Singapore's satellite had picked up a distress signal from the plane.According to airline spokesman Hartono, there are now plans to evacuate the survivors to Makassar. "The plane is in ruins," said First Air Marshal Eddy Suyanto. "The plane was found around 20 kilometers from Polewali, in the mountains." Later, the statement was rebutted by Marshall Eddy Suyanto himself and the Minister of Transportation Hatta Radjasa.This statement was an erroneously reported. Government had apologized to the public for this statement. This have been made an anguish to the relatives and family members.Six days after plane crashed, wreckage of the ill-fated plane has still not been found. Indonesia has widened the hunt around Sulawesi Island. Indonesian rescuer was assisted by US satellite and Singapore Air Force.Police in Indonesia have forwarded a 200-page brief concerning the Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 disaster to prosecutors. The move comes as an indication that the trial of pilot-in-command Captain Marwoto Komar is set to commence within weeks.The March 7, 2007 crash of a Boeing 737-400 at Yogyakarta International Airport killed 21 people. 119 others were able to escape the burning wreckage after the plane overshot the runway, going through the perimeter fence and crossing a road and an embankment to come to rest in a paddy field. Most of the deceased were Indonesians, with five from neighbouring Australia also killed.A final report was later issued after an investigation by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) in October 2007. The report blamed pilot error for the crash, finding that the airliner had touched down at roughly twice the accepted safe landing speed, and that Komar was "fixated" on landing and "probably emotionally aroused". The Cockpit Voice Recorder indicated that he ignored fifteen activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System and a call from his co-pilot for a 'go-around' as the plane touched down. A number of other criticisms were also leveled at the airport, the airline and transport politicians for contributing factors.Komar is to be prosecuted over the crash for negligence. His earlier arrest - which he was subsequently released from pending full charges - sparked protests from Indonesian aviation groups and criticism from international groups, including IFALPA, a powerful international airline pilots' association.Evidence in his trial is set to include documentational evidence and aircraft wreckage, but it is unclear whether it will include the NTSC report. Much controversy was caused by the suggestion it may be used, since international regulations limit the use of materials intended for safety investigations as evidence to prove liability in criminal or civil cases.Kamal Firdaus, council for the pilot, explained what this means for his client: "Today the documentation has been officially accepted by the prosecutor," adding, "I suspect from this it will be two to three weeks until it is handed over to the court - that's the usual practice. Usually the first hearing is two weeks after that." Firdaus commented that it would be "difficult" for liability to be established and that, "we are ready and it will be a very interesting legal case, so let's see what will happen in the court."Komar, 45, is believed to be the first pilot prosecuted over an air accident in Indonesia despite the country's poor aviation safety record. He is being charged with three counts of negligence, but the potential sentence is unclear, as Aero-News reports that he could face life imprisonment while The Age says he can face up to seven years' imprisonment. His case is considered a landmark, with aviation groups believing his trial may set the precedent for pilots involved in future accidents.An M-28 Skytruck plane operated by police in Indonesia crashed into the sea near the island of Batam today. The fifteen on board are missing.The domestic flight from Pangkal Pinang on Bangka to Batam lost contact with Singaporean air traffic control at 10:22 Batam local time; Singapore has controlled some Indonesian airspace since the 1940s. Fisherman have located wreckage and body parts off the coast of Kabupaten Lingga in the Riau Islands which also include Batam.The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore activated its Crisis Management Centre and has supplied a Super Puma helicopter and a Fokker 50 plane for search and rescue. Two Singaporean ships are on standby awaiting Indonesian clearance. Three Indonesian naval ships and two patrol boats are also involved. Basarnas, the Indonesian search and rescue authority, says a 200 square-nautical-mile (about 700 square km) area is being searched. Items recovered thus far include seats, luggage, and documents. Basarnas head Bambang Soelistyo said survivors were possible.Mount Lokon, one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, has erupted for the first time since 1991. The volcano has erupted at least three times in the space of two days.In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, no casualties have been reported. However, 4,400 have been evacuated from the surrounding area as a result of the incident with 28,000 evacuations being recommended in total by a disaster and vulcanology relief centre, aimed at those residing within a three-and-a-half kilometre (two mile) radius of the landmark, which was created last weekend. As well as this, the centre has increased the volcano status to its peak level. According to Darwis Sitinjak, a representative of an agency involved with disasters, rescuers - assisted by police officers and soldiers - were evacuating around five hundred inhabitants of the slopes of the mountain, Sitinjak told radio station El Shinta.Lokon, in Sulawesi, a province located in the north of the country, commenced experiencing a volcanic eruption at approximately 1530 UTC Thursday. According to National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, "[t]he eruption has set ablaze the forests around the crater". Kristianto, a volcanologist working for the government of Indonesia, has reported "no mass panic because the community has already been warned of the situation" and the evacuation of residents is ongoing, Kristianto said to Agence France-Presse. On Wednesday, two thousand other people departed from the area.Out of the 129 volcanoes located in Indonesia, Mount Lokon is considered to be amongst the most active, standing at a peak of 1,580 metres (5,184 feet). Rocks, lava, smoke, ash and sand were thrown at a height of 1,500 metres (4,800 feet), according to Kristianto. On Friday, Lokon erupted again at around 1700 UTC on Thursday before erupting for a third time at approximately 1810 UTC the same day.Villagers assisting recovery efforts for a Russian passenger jet that crashed in Indonesia have found the aircraft's missing flight data recorder. All 45 on board were killed when the Sukhoi Superjet 100 crashed during a demonstration flight earlier this month.The cockpit voice recorder was found several days after the plane hit Mount Salak, West Java on May 9. A landslide triggered by the impact had concealed the flight data recorder, but it was uncovered today after recent rains removed some of the soil it was under. "It seems to be intact," said Ketut Purwa, who is leading the recovery. It was sent to Jakarta for examination.The recorder was found in a ravine 30 metres from the tail, which was also located by villagers. It contains a log of technical data from the 40-minute demonstration, which aimed to attract Indonesian airlines to buy Superjet 100s.Tatang Kurniadi, head of the National Transportation Safety Committee, explained "The FDR emits a signal for up to a month but only if it's underwater. It doesn't work on land". In addition to the Indonesian investigation, Russian authorities have launched a criminal probe. The dead include eight Russians. Kurniadi also said work to complete an Indonesian translation of the voice recorder transcript is nearing completion.The aircraft had asked for permission to descend to 6,000 feet shortly before the crash. It then hit the 7,200-foot mountain near Jakarta. In the midst of an Asian tour, Sukhoi had placed an experienced pilot in charge of the plane.The Superjet 100 is intended to reinvigorate the Russian aviation industry, and is the nation's first new airliner since the Soviet era. With a maiden flight in 2008, it entered service last year and Sukhoi boasts 200 orders. The twin-engine jet seats around 100 and costs buyers US$31.7 million.An inquest was held this week after a 10-year-old boy died after being shot with an air rifle in Swansea, Wales. On September 27, 2009, Rhys Johnson and his friend, aged 12, took, without permission, an air gun which belonged to Rhys' father. The two boys played with it near to the location of the Johnson house in the district of Llansamlet. They were unsupervised when they were shooting the gun at a bucket that was hanging in a tree and a tin can that was placed on a box.The friend, who has remained anonymous, shot Rhys Johnson in the heart with the .22 caliber Webley Vulcan air gun at close range. Johnson died in a hospital at 0211 BST the next day from said wound. Philip Rogers, a coroner from Swansea, recorded the verdict as an accidental death. He was told that the friend had no intention of shooting Johnson. Therefore, no legal action has been taken against Johnson's friend accordingly.Detective Sergeant Nigel Morgan of South Wales Police said that "Rhys was standing to his left calling [his friend] and laughing. The boy held the rifle at the butt in his right arm with his finger on the trigger. As he turned he felt the gun to be heavy. As it fell away he pulled it towards him and accidentally fired the trigger. Rhys was holding himself to the chest—he thought he was joking then he thought he's shot Rhys in the hand. He saw no blood and Rhys ran to the house." The detective stated that the friend "was crying and apologizing for what happened."Rhys Johnson's father, David, age 36, an engineer in a workshop and the owner of the air rifle testified, "I would allow him to use it if he was with me when I was up the garden or we were spending time together. Rhys would have shown interest in it from when he was about eight-years-old." The coroner urged "anyone with children to try and ensure that such weapons are not used without parental supervision," going on to say that he was "sure Mr. and Mrs. Johnson were not aware the children were using the weapon unsupervised."A fatal accident inquiry concluded three patients who underwent keyhole surgery to remove their gall bladders died as a result of mistakes during, and after, the operations. Agnes Nicol, George Johnstone, and Andrew Ritchie died within a three-month period in 2006 whilst in the care of NHS Lanarkshire in Scotland.Later expanded to look at all three deaths, the inquiry initially established to look into the case of Nicol, 50, who received surgery in late 2005. A surgeon at Wishaw General Hospital mistakenly cut her bile duct and her right hepatic artery. Whilst suturing her portal vein, her liver was left with 20% of its normal blood supply; the errors were not discovered until her transfer to liver specialists at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary.By then, her liver was seriously damaged. She developed septicaemia, dying from multiple organ failure in March 2006.Johnstone, 54, underwent the same procedure at Monklands District General Hospital on May 9, 2006. A consultant surgeon accidentally damaged, possibly severing, his bile duct. He died two days later in intensive care from the combined effects of multiple organ failure and a heart ailment.Ritchie, 62, died in intensive care a week after an operation in June 2006. He died from intra abdominal haemorrhage caused by errors during the surgery.Different surgeons were involved each time and the inquiry, under Sheriff Robert Dickson, found no evidence of poor training or inadequate experience. Dickson noted that in each case there was lack of action on a "growing body of evidence that there was something fundamentally wrong with the patient" and surgeons failed to contemplate their own actions as potentially responsible. He agreed with two professors that it may have been possible to save their lives "had the post-operative care been to the standard which they expected, and had there been a proper management plan which staff could have worked to" and noted that all the patients suffered from a lack of adequate medical notes being available after their surgery. He described the care as having "clear faults".NHS Lanarkshire has issued an apology, saying they "did fall below the high standards of care we aim to maintain in these cases and this has been extremely distressing for the patients' families. We would like to take this opportunity to apologise to them." The health board added improvements had been made regarding "these types of cases" as well as with document management.A Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) ruled on Thursday a helicopter crash into the North Sea might have been prevented had proper maintenance procedures been followed. All sixteen on board died when the aircraft went down off the Scottish coast.After a hearing in Aberdeen, Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle found Bond Offshore Helicopters failed to remove a component after a metal shard was found. The shard suggested spalling, or the shedding of metal particles in the aircraft's gearbox. "The size and shape of the particle found [...] were consistent with an advanced stage of classic spalling" according to the inquiry's findings.A week before the crash Bond mulled partially replacing the gearbox. The aircraft went down after the gearbox failed in flight. Pyle found a failure in communication between Bond and helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter had led to the decision not to replace the gearbox.The routine flight was taking oil workers back to Aberdeen from the Miller offshore oil platform, owned by BP. The aircraft radioed air traffic control to inform they were twenty minutes from Aberdeen Airport but six seconds later was confronted with an oil warning light and grinding sounds. The crew declared an emergency but the main rotor broke free, which in turn smashed through the tail leaving the aircraft to plunge into the sea. The aircraft crashed within twenty seconds of the first sign of trouble.The inquiry is surrounded by controversy owing to the five-year gap between accident and findings, and the decision by Crown Office not to prosecute over the crash. "For a criminal prosecution to have taken place, the Crown would have to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt" a Crown Office statement said on Thursday. "The Sheriff Principal makes clear that a reasonable doubt remained over the technical cause of the crash".Although the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Sheriff Pyle found a catastrophic gearbox failure triggered the crash, the exact cause of the failure was never conclusively decided. After hearing expert evidence Pyle found the balance of probabilities  pointed to spalling, but could not rule out a manufacturing defect. The inquiry's findings note "that it would be an extraordinary coincidence if the failure properly to carry out inspection and maintenance of the helicopter’s gearbox was not causative of a catastrophic failure of the same within a matter of days. But, as the evidence made clear, such a coincidence was indeed a possibility." Pyle's report added "the small piece of the helicopter which would have proved the matter beyond any doubt [has] not been recovered from the seabed".Bond have released a statement noting "We have always accepted that we made mistakes through honest confusion over telephone calls and emails." Sheriff Pyle found Bond's employees "tried to carry out their jobs as diligently as they could. All of them impressed me as engineers who well understood the vital importance of their role in ensuring [...] safety". He also found staff were well-trained and resourced, echoing findings by the AAIB and the Civil Aviation Authority.Pyle noted Bond readily accepted they should have properly followed the maintenance manual and normally did, but "on one occasion, that fundamental rule was broken" and the crash was likely a result. Bond, Eurocopter, and investigators all gave evidence.Trade unions and victims' families, however, have slammed the decision not to prosecute. While welcoming the FAI's conclusions, victims' lawyer Tom Marshall said the families wanted to review the decision not to prosecute with the Lord Advocate, and are also seeking a broader public inquiry. Audrey Wood, whose son Stuart died in the disaster, said "How [Crown Office] arrived at that decision [not prosecuting] will haunt us, as not only did we hear of multiple breaches of health and safety, but the decision was also made without all the evidence being present, as vital witness statements had not been given". Wood said there were multiple breaches of health and safety law that could be prosecuted.  Crown Office's statement counters "evidence presented during the FAI has not altered the insufficiency of evidence, therefore the decision not to hold criminal proceedings remains the correct one". Unite union branded their decision a "travesty of justice".Politicians have criticised the five-year delay holding the FAI, as has Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith who said "It is vitally important that lessons are learned at the earliest opportunity following tragedies where lives are lost". Sheriff Pyle himself concluded "what can, I think, very properly be said is that nearly five years [delay] is on any view far too long and that we all have a responsibility for that. [...] everyone concerned in future fatal accidents involving aircraft of whatever kind should do much better."Labour have called for new FAI rules; MSP Patricia Ferguson has put a bill before parliament;  the Scottish Government says Sheriff Pyle's conclusions are being scrutinised. MSP Richard Baker said the victims' families and North Sea oil workers, who routinely use helicopters, had waited "far too long" for the FAI to conclude. "FAIs should never be delayed so long again."Crown Office expressed sympathy with the families involved for the delay but blamed the complex nature of the investigation, and pointed out the AAIB, Civil Aviation Authority, and local police had all already conducted their own enquiries. The AAIB spent 30 months investigating.Twelve victims were from Scotland, many of those from in and around Aberdeen where the six-week inquiry was held. Three more were from elsewhere in the UK and the last was a Latvian national. Half of the fourteen passengers and two crew died "instantaneously" and the rest died very shortly after impact with the sea from blunt force trauma, the inquiry found. None survived long enough to drown, according to Sheriff Pyle. Nonetheless he noted "there was a poignant moment when a witness was being taken through the graph in the AAIB report which set out the timeline of the accident that I, if not others present, understood for the first time the true horror of what took place."Audrey Wood said "The length of wait for nearly five years has been intolerable for all the families and we, the families, feel let down by the system." Bond's statement this week says "We would like to express again our deep sorrow at the 16 lives lost. Bond Offshore hopes [the inquiry] brings a degree of closure to the families, friends and dependents of those who died in the tragedy of 2009." The sheriff also noted the "courage" of victims' families, who attended the full hearing.The city of Yala, Thailand was hit by a bomb attack this morning in a fresh food market wounding 24, including three soldiers. One injured soldier is said to be in a serious condition.The bomb was hidden in a motorcycle and detonated via remote.  The police believe the bomb contained between seven and ten kilograms of explosives.  Two men were witnessed parking the bike; police had checked the vehicle without detecting the bomb. It is suspected the bomb may have been detonated using a mobile phone.This particular area of the city has been a target of local insurgents in the past; four attacks have occurred nearby and the implementation of new security measures is under consideration. These may include a prohibition on parking vehicles in front of the market, and introduction of closed-circuit television in the area.The explosion occurred around 7:30 am local time (00.30 UTC). A range of civilians were injured in addition to members of the military; the attack is being blamed on insurgent members of the Malay-Muslim majority in southern Thailand.Insurgents in Iraq have used a chemical car bomb to kill at least 32 people and injuring at least 50 in the Diyala Province, in the village of Abu Saydah on Tuesday. Reports say that the vehicle used in the attack was parked at a market near two tea stalls."A small van with gas canisters exploded in a crowded market, there were many people dead at the scene," said Iraqi police officer, Captain Sadiq Mohammed.According to police, the bomb was described as being filled with chlorine gas and injuries reported at the local hospital include burns from a "poisonous gas," but the United States military in Iraq denies those reports."Our folks on the scene... who are investigating this do not have any of those indications," said a spokesman for the U.S. military in Iraq, Lt-Col Michael Donnelly.One of the injured, Kadim Hussein, who was taken to the Imam Ali hospital in Sadr City for treatment, complained of eye irritation. "My eyes became puffy due the chlorine gas that was packed in the car bomb...also I had many pieces of shrapnel in my chest and right shoulder," he said. Hospitals in Muqdadiyah and Sadr City received most of the victims of the bomb blast.  Doctors and authorities at the Imam Ali hospital reported that 11 of the patients they treated were presented with symptoms typical of chlorine poisoning and that many of the victims had trouble breathing. Chlorine can burn the skin almost instantly and can kill a person if they inhale too much of the fumes. Chlorine is usually used domestically as a disinfectant as well as a bleach.In April, at least 35 were killed when insurgents detonated a chlorine bomb in the city of Ramadi.This comes just 6 days after Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. Mixon, commander of the 25th Infantry Division based in Iraq's Diyala province asked for more troops to help with insurgents.At least 24 people died today in Baghdad as dozens of mortars were fired throughout the city, destroying at least two buildings. The incidents occurred just as Iraq's parliamentary election commenced. The election is the second since Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. 6,200 candidates are competing for 325 parliament seats in the election.Insurgents have promised to disrupt the elections by means of violence to show their opposition to America and the Shiite-led Iraqi government. A group linked to al-Qaeda distributed leaflets in the capital advising people against going to vote. Polling opened at 7 AM (local time) and immediately bombs were detonated and mortar rounds landed throughout the city.In Shurta, West Baghdad, twelve were confirmed dead, and rescue workers saved twenty from the debris of a demolished building. Across the Tigris River, in East Baghdad, five were killed in a blast at a residential building. The Green Zone, the area that hosts the U.S. Embassy and the Prime Minister's office, was also hit by mortar rounds. Seven others died in various parts of the nation. No polling stations were hit.Nouri Maliki, the present Prime Minister, called for a strong turnout to boost democracy in the country. Although violence in Iraq is much reduced from its peak, hundreds of people are dying each month even now and the country continues to have poor infrastructure. To prevent attacks, the border with Iran was shut down, several troops deployed, and movement of unauthorized vehicles banned, leaving Baghdad's roads almost empty. Despite this, people continued to head to the polls. "If we had to crawl, we would crawl in order to vote," said a resident, Ali Abdul Wahab, though according to him: "anyone we vote for will be bad."On Saturday, a car bomb detonated near a parking lot used by pilgrims in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, killed three. Two Iranians and an Iraqi were those who died in the attack, only about 300 yards from the Imam Ali shrine, a holy site in Shiite Islam. 54 people were wounded, of whom 19 were Iranians.A United States Apache military helicopter has been shot down in Baghdad, Iraq says a military spokesman.Reports say that the chopper went down near the U.S. air base, Taji, located just north of downtown Baghdad."I can confirm that we are looking into reports that a helicopter went down north of Baghdad," said Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military. At least 2 soldiers were on board the aircraft, but their condition is not known.Witnesses near the scene and police say that at least 2 Apaches were flying together when insurgents began to shoot at the choppers, shooting one of them down and hitting the other, but the helicopter still managed to fly away. The helicopters were believed to have been escorting a U.S. military convoy on the ground when shots were fired."I saw smoke coming out of the tail. The chopper was swinging around before it hit the ground one kilometer away from me and I heard a big explosion," said local farmer, Hashim Assafi who also said that he had to find shelter as shots were fired in the direction of the helicopters.In a statement posted on an Al-Qaeda in Iraq website, insurgents claim responsibility for shooting down the helicopter."We say to the enemies of God that the sky of the Islamic state of Iraq is forbidden just like its land," said the statement.This is the fourth helicopter operated by the U.S. military to crash or be shot down in two weeks.The United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has released an interim report into the crash of British Airways Flight 38. The Boeing 777-ER crashed early this year as it tried to land at London's Heathrow Airport.The report states that the AAIB believes the crash occurred when ice crystals formed within the fuel system. However, it should be noted that the report only serves as an update into the progress of the investigation and that the final report is yet to be published and may yet reach a different conclusion into the cause of the accident.The flight from Beijing, China had been normal until final approach at Heathrow, at which point the aircraft was coming in for landing with the autopilot and autothrottle engaged. However, engine power became greatly reduced when the autothrottle requested more thrust, and the aircraft made a forced landing 1,000 feet from the runway. The aircraft suffered substantial damage as it slid across the grass to the runway threshold, where it came to rest, and was written off. There was only one serious injury and eight minor ones to the 136 passengers and 16 crew.As the jet passed over Siberia it encountered significantly reduced temperatures. The AAIB has determined that the fuel was at a temperature below 0°C for an unusually long duration. This is believed to have caused water in the fuel - which met all relevant international standards - to have frozen into crystals. These were able to form undetected as the aircraft cruised with a low fuel requirement, and it was only when extra fuel was pumped in from the tanks for the landing that the crystals became a problem.The report says that the current explanation being offered for the accident is an "apparently hitherto unknown phenomenon" and warns that other combinations of aircraft models and engines may also be vulnerable. The 777 involved was powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 800s, like 222 of the 736 777s currently operating. Data from 141,000 other flights of such aircraft has not yielded any other set of circumstances similar to the one in the crash flight.In light of these results, a worldwide alert has been issued to the 11 airlines that between them operate all the aircraft identical to the lost jet. Boeing have instructed airlines to vary altitude regularly when fuel is below 10°C and to run the engines at max power for ten seconds before attempting a landing if the fuel has been at such temperatures for over three hours. The extra power is intended to clear out any buildup of water. To prevent buildup of water during ground operation at freezing temperatures all fuel pumps should be run at full power for one minute.Air New Zealand have already confirmed they will introduce the new measures, and United States authorities are expected to make them mandatory within days. The affected aircraft are operated by US carriers American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.Interpol on Friday evening arrested Abdul 'Bhola' Rehman in Bangkok, Thailand. Rehman, 46, is accused of starting a 2012 garment factory fire in Karachi, Pakistan that killed over 250.Initially thought to be accidental, the fire is now believed to have been set deliberately by an extortion group targeting the factory's owners. Rehman is accused of receiving an order to start the fire. He is expected to be extradited to Pakistan where he is facing charges under terrorism legislation.The Pakistani Interior Ministry was ordered by a court to arrest Rehman and another suspect, Hammad Siddiqui, with assistance from Interpol. A third accused, Zubair alias Lala, is detained in Pakistan. Around a dozen further suspects are under investigation.The Ali Enterprises factory fire in Karachi's Baldia Town area was among the worst industrial disasters in Pakistan. A judicial enquiry found insufficient emergency exits, insufficient safety training, overcrowding due to bulky equipment, and insufficient regulatory oversight all contributed. German firm KIK, the facility's main customer, paid compensation to victims.Once facing now-abandoned murder charges, the factory's owners are now being treated as witnesses. Papers lodged before Sindh High Court in February last year suggested an extortion plot. A reinvestigation commenced the following month, and earlier this year police confirmed they too believed an extortion gang to be responsible.Rehman was arrested at the Royal Garden Home Hotel, where he was staying alone. He is alleged by some reporters to have connections with the Pakistani Pak Sarzameen Party and Muttahida Qaumi Movement, something both organisations deny. He is also alleged to have worked for Karachi's local government.Rehman's wife said he was innocent.Stranded on a floe since it broke loose while he was snowmobiling across it on Friday, 39 year-old David Idlout is huddled in a tent dropped by rescue planes awaiting the arrival of a rescue helicopter that is scrambling from CFB Greenwood, Nova Scotia, the closest rescue helicopter to Resolute, Nunavut.While many places are experiencing cold temperatures, much of the Arctic has had an unusually mild winter. Too much so for professional hunter and hunting guide Idlout, who was out checking if conditions had improved after a cold snap. The breakaway floe is just more evidence conditions are still too warm, the ice too soft.Idlout's survival gear included a satellite phone, and he called his wife Tracy Kalluk as soon as he became aware the floe had broken free and was drifting into the Northwest Passage. She in turn contacted local authorities in the population 252 remote village, who got in touch with the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre, based in Trenton, OntarioThe Joint Rescue Coordination Centre scrambled two Hercules aircraft which were able to drop gear to the stranded man on Friday. The floe has been moving into the water between Griffith and Cornwallis Islands, and is approximately 15 kilometres from Resolute Bay. The supplies included a tent, stove, and additional communications gear including a locator beacon.Now well into his third night on the ice, Idlout's rescue is expected within hours. An earlier attempt was delayed when the helicopter, after its long journey from its home base, experienced mechanical failures when trying to lift off from Resolute. Weather conditions are not helpful either, as Resolute remains under blizzard warning with poor visibility and 50 km winds. His wife is speaking with Idlout every two hours, and expects the helicopter to lift him off the ice early Monday local time.On Saturday, twenty people were killed and twenty-one injured by the fire fighting system aboard a submarine of the Russian Pacific Fleet.Further details about the incident were confirmed by Russian officials yesterday, as a formal investigation continued.The incident occurred aboard K-152 Nerpa, a newly built Akula class nuclear submarine, during sea trials in the Sea of Japan. The victims include both sailors and shipyard workers.The submarine had 208 people aboard—three times the normal crew—when the fire fighting system was triggered by an unknown cause, flooding a forward compartment with Freon gas which is used to extinguish fires by removing oxygen from the atmosphere. Seventeen of the dead are reported to be employees of the Amur Shipbuilding Enterprise, the constructor of the vessel, and three Russian Navy sailors.The vessel returned to port undamaged, with the injured being conveyed to Vladivostok by destroyer.Russia planned to lease the Nerpa to the Indian Navy in 2009, according to unconfirmed Russian and Indian press reports.The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has completed its investigation into the ditching of US Airways Flight 1549 into New York's Hudson River. The fifteen-month probe began after the Airbus A320 performed a water landing when bird strikes damaged both engines in a move dubbed the "Miracle on the Hudson" by the media. Nobody was killed.The NTSB's final report, adopted after a board meeting today, concluded that a combination of safety equipment better than the mandatory minimums and good reactions by the crew were the main reasons the 150 passengers and five crew survived. The board stated that the aircraft's equipment met the standards required for "extended overwater operations", equipment that was not needed for the January 2009 flight. The aircraft was equiped with escape slides that doubled as water rafts at the front and aft emergency exits, but the aft ones were rendered unavailable. Airbus assumed when designing the aircraft that only one engine would be inoperative during an emergency ditching, and current emergency checklists assume plenty of prior warning for dual-engine failure since the aircraft would be at a high altitude. The A320 was at just 2,700 feet when the incident occurred, having just taken off when it collided with a flock of Canada geese, almost completely removing the engines' ability to generate thrust.The final report has blamed a number of factors for extensive fuselage damage caused in the impact, which cracked a rear bulkhead and caused the aircraft to flood, as well as taking the rear slides out of action. The board said standards aircraft should meet in ditchings - set by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) - were inadequate, training in industry was not sufficient for ditchings and the high level of tasks the crew had to focus on made it difficult for the pilot to maintain his airspeed. The pilot's decision to ditch was credited as being the best possible solution to the emergency.The NTSB noted that while the rear rafts failed, 64 people climbed into the forward rafts, and said many of these people would have been immersed in the frigid river. The board claimed that this could induce "cold shock", which can lead to drowning within minutes.The report found that the good visibility, calm water, nearby ferries which provided rescues within twenty minutes and good cockpit resource management, allowing the crew to maintain control, were further factors that contributed to the survival of those on board. However, it also found that "more creative and effective methods of conveying safety information to passengers" are required after learning that most passengers had not paid attention to the in-flight safety announcement. It also noted that many passengers had difficulty putting on the life vests supplied under the seats.The report further stated that the accident was hard to predict due to the fact that bird strikes tend to occur much lower, usually below 500 feet. It considered the possibilities of fitting engine screens or redesigning engines to mitigate bird strike risk, but these proposals were rejected after consideration since they were deemed unfeasable. NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman described the circumstances as "a great example of the professionalism of the crewmembers, air traffic controllers and emergency responders who all played a role in preserving the safety of everyone aboard." She further discussed the safety recommendations the report will contain when it is released. "I believe the safety recommendations that have come out of this investigation have an extraordinary origin - a very serious accident in which everyone survived. Even in an accident where everyone survives, there are lessons learned and areas that could use improvement.  Our report today takes these lessons learned so that, if our recommendations are implemented, every passenger and crewmember may have the opportunity to benefit from the advances in safety." A total of 35 recommendations have been made seeking improved checklists for emergencies, better certification standards for aircraft and their engines, advances in crew training, better safety equipment and improved safety briefings to passengers.One result of these findings is that the board will likely ask the FAA to require emergency equipment for water landings on all commercial aircraft. The FAA has until now held that such a move would place a disproportionately high cost on airlines.An investigation into the fatal 2009 Washington Metro train collision conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called for new safety and maintenance rules. The report, released today, blamed the crash on the faulty automatic train-control system. The report also cited the use of dated 1000-Series train cars. The 2009 crash, which killed 9 and injured 80, occurred during the evening rush between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations on the Red Line.NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said that the system is currently regulated by state and local agencies. She called for Federal oversight. "Now it’s really time for them to step up to the plate and for Congress to address the issue," Hersman said during the release of the findings.In 2009, Hersman told Congress that Federal safety guidelines should be set saying "the state oversight system is not effective, they don’t have any teeth." Currently the Federal government has control of interstate transit systems, not regional or local transit systems.The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) said yesterday that it would replace all of it's 1000-Series trains with newer models. After the crash, then WMATA general manager, John Catoe said that "the system is safe." WMATA's interim general manager Richard Sarles said that "We are committed to considering and following through on the findings and recommendations."An investigation is tonight underway after a light aircraft crashed into a popular mountain resort in the Philippines city of Baguio, killing two aboard, and injuring four others. The aircraft, which may have been trying to make an emergency landing, narrowly missed crashing into a tourist resort where a crowd had gathered.Witnesses said the six-seater Piper Aztec aircraft was flying very low before it clipped pine trees and impacted with the ground, bursting into flames. The crash happened just minutes after it lifted off from Loakan Airport. One person aboard the aircraft was killed instantly, and the four others were taken to hospital where another died. No-one on the ground was hurt in the accident.Police confirmed the aircraft crashed into a mountain trail and exploded. Wikinews understands air traffic controllers lost contact with the pilot shortly after takeoff, and officials say the aircraft may have suffered technical problems. Police told journalists the pilot might have been attempting to make an emergency landing in an open area but struck trees.New safety procedures are to be implemented after an American Airlines Boeing 777 came close to colliding with two U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III aircraft off the coast of New York, United States, last month. Radar data indicates the aircraft came within 1 miles (2 km) of each other before the flight crew of the Boeing 777 took evasive action as an alarm sounded in the cockpit of the jet.An aviation official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the traffic collision avoidance system alarm which sounded in the cockpit of the passenger jet, which had 259 people aboard, "may be what saved the day," since C-17 cargo aircraft are not highly manoeuvrable. Investigators have reportedly found the aircraft would have collided head-on.The National Transportation Safety Board has launched a "major investigation" into the incident, and confirmed there were no injuries in the incident. The Federal Aviation Administration, the government department responsible for aviation in the U.S., said in a statement air traffic controllers are "reviewing a variety of procedures including the handling of formation flights, aircraft near sector boundaries.”Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee yesterday declared pilot error to be behind the crash of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501. All 162 passengers and crew died when the plane crashed into the Java Sea a year ago.The Airbus A320-200 was around 40 minutes from Surabaya's Juanda International Airport to Singapore's Changi International Airport when it vanished on December 28. Wreckage and bodies were found floating two days later; National Search and Rescue Agency divers led an international recovery effort but over 50 bodies remain lost.The pilots were facing a fault with the rudder travel limiter, a part involved in rudder control. They repeatedly received warnings on their Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) system. The first three times Indonesian Pilot Iriyanto and French co-pilot Remi Emmanuel Plesel followed correct procedure only for the fault to recur. The fourth time, they tried something else — based on Flight Data Recorder readouts, investigators believe they reset power to their Flight Augmentation Computers.The computers are principally responsible for rudder control and aircraft stability. With both computers switched off, the entire fly-by-wire system of semi-automation disconnected, as did the autopilot and autothrust systems. The pilots were now left to fly entirely manually, without automation that protects the aircraft from entering unusual and dangerous positions.A miscommunication followed. Iriyanto asked Plesel, who was flying, to "pull down". Plesel pulled the controls down, which pitched the nose up; Iriyanto had wanted to descend. The flight ascended without permission through 36,000ft with a ground speed of 353knts. The aircraft would normally be travelling faster, with a nearby Emirates jet at a ground speed of 503knts at 36,000ft. The aircraft also banked as the disengagement of automation left the rudder off-centre.The AirAsia flight reached 38,000ft and entered a stall. The crew did not manage to regain control. The 155 passengers and seven crew died when the plane hit the sea. Most were Indonesians, but for three South Koreans, one Malaysian, one Brit, and French national Plesel.The fault was traced to cracked solder on a circuit board. It had repeatedly occurred in the weeks before the crash. The investigation concluded maintenance failings contributed to the disaster, but Muhammad Alwi of the Indonesian Transportation Ministry said "Repeated trouble in maintenance is a normal thing[...] If the trouble is fixed in accordance with the manual maintenance procedures, then it's alright".Investigators believe the solder crack is attributable to extreme temperature changes in the unprotected compartment near the tail that houses the component.The investigation further found the flight crew were untrained in recovering from extreme events. AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes said yesterday "there is much to be learned here for AirAsia, the manufacturer and the aviation industry... We will not leave any stone unturned to make sure the industry learns from this tragic incident".The report also dismisses weather as a contributory factor. The flight was diverting around storms in the area.Iriyanto and Plessel had over 8,000 hours experience between them. Iriyanto had a decade of experience training other pilots, and previous employers include the air force. They spent three minutes struggling to regain control as the pane fell to the sea. Some bodies were recovered around 1,000km away near Sulawesi.AFP spoke to Terence Fan, an air industry expert from Singapore Management University, who said "It's a scenario that has played out in air accidents in the past[...] Pilots are either distracted by a faulty equipment or cannot properly solve the issue and something else is brewing in the background."One such accident was the loss of Air France Flight 447 in 2009 into the Atlantic. It was investigated by the BEA of France, which also assisted the AirAsia probe. The BEA issued recommendations on how to train pilots after the Air France crash. Ex-BEA boss Jean-Paul Troadec said to AFP "Several recommendations of the (BEA) on the subject of pilot training were clearly not implemented by [AirAsia]."Indonesia saw such an accident on New Years' Day 2007 when Adam Air Flight 574 crashed into the Makasser Strait near Sulawesi. The plane suffered a failure on a navigational instrument. While pilots were troubleshooting for this navigational system they first unintentionally disconnected the autopilot, then lost control and crashed into the sea.The US federal National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) yesterday concluded a "series of errors" by flight crew caused a business jet crash near Boston, Massachusetts last year. Seven were killed when the Gulfstream IV overran a runway.The NTSB found the pilots failed to conduct preflight checks, mistakenly took off with flight control systems locked in position, and then failed to abort takeoff until too late. Manufacturer Gulfstream was criticised for an inadequate safety system; the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was accused of failing to properly check the system before certifying the aircraft.On the evening of May 31 the passengers and crew were returning from Hanscom Field to Atlanta International Airport. Pilot Bauke "Mike" de Vries and co-pilot James McDowell each had thousands of hours' experience, and had flown together for years. They skipped over preflight checks; the NTSB found this was routine for the pair.The plane set off with the gust lock engaged. This system, which is intended to be disconnected before engine startup, locks various flight control surfaces in position on the ground. Unable to takeoff, it overshot the runway, crashing through airport equipment and a fence, before landing in a watery ravine and bursting into flames. Nobody survived.De Vries says several times "lock is on" on the voice recording, adding "I can't stop it" moments before the crash. Gulfstream had installed a mechanism to prevent the throttle fully moving when gust lock was engaged, to give pilots a clear early warning something was amiss.The NTSB found the throttle could still be pushed far enough to reach takeoff speed. The FAA had certified the system based on technical drawings. The NTSB said the FAA process was "inadequate" because there were no "engineering certification tests or analysis[...] to verify that the system had met its regulatory requirements." Gulfstream say they are working with the FAA to rectify the issue.The NTSB says it took ten seconds from noticing the problem before the crew began braking and another four seconds to power down the engines. The NTSB believes doing both within eleven seconds would have brought the flight to a halt on the runway.The lock was applied upon landing six hours earlier. The flight was carrying four passengers, including entrepreneur and philanthropist Lewis Katz, back from a fundraiser. The seventh fatality was a flight attendant. Katz had co-engineered an $88 million takeover deal for the Philadelphia Inquirer four days earlier.The Katz family later sold his stake in the paper to a business partner. Katz had hoped to boost the paper's reputation."Complacency does not have a place in the cockpit of any aircraft", NTSB Vice Chairman Bella Dinh-Zarr said. The probe found skipped checks on 98% of the prior 175 flights the pilots undertook together. "If you're acting that way, you are just fooling yourself," said NTSB member Robert Sumwalt, who has 32 years of commercial flight experience.Investigators have discovered a hole in the fuel tank of the China Airlines jet that caught fire and exploded on August 20 on the island of Okinawa, Japan.Investigators from Japan, Taiwan and the United States have all been examining the wreckage of China Airlines Flight 120 since the accident. Now, Japanese investigators say that they have found that a structural bolt had pierced the fuel tank of the Boeing 737-800 series aircraft."We spotted a hole in a fuel tank," said a brief statement by the transport ministry's investigative division."We suspect that oil leaked from this hole and spilled from the right wing to the outside."It is understood that, prior to the discovery of the hole, the investigation had been focusing on the tubing connecting the fuel tank to the engine, rather than the tank itself.Taiwan-based China Airlines's only comment was to repeat earlier comments that the plane had been inspected last month, at which point the airline had been unable to find any problem with it. However, prior to this news, the chief executive flew to Okinawa to console worried tourists, while chairman Philip Wei offered to resign "...in a bid to shoulder his responsibility,", according to an airline official. The airline is also offering compensation to passengers on the flight.Boeing refused to comment on the incident, citing the fact that the investigation remains open. However, the Jiji Press has reported that Boeing had warned airlines in 2006 about the possibility of bolts piercing the fuel tanks, after a number of incidents in which tank piercing was found to have occurred.Investigators in Tuesday's crash of the Airwork Metroliner airplane recovered the black box and cockpit voice recorder. According to witness reports, the airplane exploded in mid-air and crashed into a Taranaki farmland six kilometres east of Stratford, New Zealand. Both pilots were killed. The pilots have been named as Clive Roger Adamson (43) of Wellington, and Tony Drummond (41) of Auckland.  The aircraft was on a regular mail run from Auckland to Wellington carrying courier post and mail.Iquique, Chile has been struck by a moderate magnitude 5.6 earthquake, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).The quake's epicenter was located approximately 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) east, northeast of Iquique and had a depth of 35 km (21.7 miles).According to the USGS, damage could be moderate, but so far there are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths. Some power outages were reported. Iquique has a population of over 227,000 people.A building in Iran's capital Tehran collapsed today and killed at least 19 people. The fate of a twentieth person is unknown.The victims were all labourers living inside the building, which is reported to have been in a seriously unstable condition for a month, with occupants refusing to comply with evacuation requests. The early morning disaster in the Sa'adatabad district reduced the building to rubble in seconds.The seven story building was described by The Canadian Press as 'dilapidated'.Five people have been arrested, including the owner and contractors. Iranian state media promised that those responsible would be dealt with severely.On Saturday morning three Jundallah men responsible for the bombing of a mosque in Zahedan, Iran, on Thursday, May 28, were hanged near the same mosque. The Iranian government said the United States, al Qaeda and Israel were involved in the bombing; the U.S. State Department rejected the allegation of American involvement.The bomb had exploded in the city's second largest Shiite mosque, Amir Al-Momenin, during evening prayers killing 25 and injuring at least 145 others."The bomb exploded at the time of evening prayer and killed a number of worshippers," said Ali Mohammad Azad, the governor general of the province of Sistan and Baluchestan. This Iranian province borders both Pakistan and Afghanistan.The three men were already in custody prior to the explosion, in connection with previous bombing attacks in 2007. The provincial judiciary reported that the three confessed to "illegally bringing explosives into Iran and giving them to the main person behind the bombing.""The bombing happened with the explosives these three convicted criminals brought to the country. They were convicted as 'mohareb' (fighter against God), 'corrupt on the earth' and acting against national security," said Ebrahim Hamidi, a local judiciary official. Sunni rebels of the Jundullah (Soldiers of God) group said they sent a suicide bomber to attack a secret meeting of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards being held in the mosque. Mosques are held to be "gathering places for revolutionary Shiites"."I announce that ... those who committed the bombing are neither Shi'ite nor Sunni. They are Americans and Israelis," said Sadegh Mahsouli, interior minister in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's cabinet. Jalal Sayyah, a senior security official in Zahedan, said, "Hire of the terrorists by the U.S. was verified based on investigation." Iran says that the Jundallah are part of the al Qaeda and are also backed by the United States who equipped the terrorists. These claims have been denied by Washington.The Islamic Republic of Iran Presidential elections will be held June 12. On Friday, the presidential campaign offices were also attacked by gunmen.Thursday was a public Iranian holiday which honoured the death of Fatima Zahra, "the Mother of the Imams", the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.Yesterday, the Iranian military announced the wreckage of an Aseman Airlines airplane, which went missing on Sunday morning shortly before it was due to land in Yasuj, had been located at an elevation of about 13,000 feet (4,000 m) in the Zagros Mountains. All 65 people on board were presumed dead. Crews were searching for the aircraft's two black boxes to try to determine why it crashed.Ramezan Sharif, a spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guards, said wreckage of the ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop had been sighted by a military drone and helicopters had then been sent to the location. Helicopter pilot Captain Soheili said on state television the wreckage was only some 100 feet (30 m) from a peak on Mount Dena, and "large parts of the plane, which were labeled with the Aseman company logo" were visible. The Revolutionary Guards released photos in which they said bodies of victims could be seen. Regional medical center director Ghafoor Rastinrooz told the official IRNA news agency that helicopters were unable to land at the site because of "deep and dangerous crevices in the area of the crash". General Kiumars Heidari, chief of ground forces in the Iranian Army, told the Fars News Agency the dead would have to be brought down the mountain by commandos using specialized ground vehicles.The plane took off at about 0430 UTC on Sunday from the Iranian capital, Tehran, on Aseman Airlines route EP3704 to Yasuj, in the southwest of the country. It vanished from controllers' radar screens at about 8:52 local time, 0522 UTC, and there were reports from people in the area of Samirom, about 14 miles (22 km) from its destination in Isfahan Province, of seeing it attempting an emergency landing in a pasture and of hearing the crash. Hundreds of searchers organized by the Red Crescent and using drones and dogs combed the mountainous terrain but were hampered by windy, foggy conditions and heavy snow. The search had to be suspended on Sunday. It resumed at dawn on Monday but weather then forced grounding the helicopters. At one point on Monday local officials announced searchers had found the wreckage, only to have the national civil aviation agency and the Red Crescent indicate the statement had been premature. A demonstration was reported by more than 100 people outside a Dena Kooh government office, demanding resignations.The plane reportedly had a crew of six — a pilot and a co-pilot, two flight attendants, and two security guards — and 59 passengers, one of them a child. A man who recounted missing the flight told the Tabnak news site "God has been really kind to me", expressing his sadness over those who had died.The aircraft was 24 years old. Aseman Airlines, Iran's third largest air carrier and owned by the national civil service pension foundation, said it had been in storage for seven years before recently being placed in operation again. Iran's aircraft are aging and the country has been prevented from buying spare parts by international sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear program. Those sanctions were to be lifted under an agreement from 2015, and Iranian airlines, including Aseman, have ordered new planes from both Airbus and Boeing. However, since becoming US President, Donald Trump has declined to recertify the agreement. There have been a number of serious Iranian air accidents in modern times.  In 2011, at least 77 people died when an Iran Air Boeing 727 crashed during an emergency landing.The pilot in the current crash, Captain Hojjatallah Foulad, successfully landed an ATR 72 at the airport in Yasuj in 2013 after one of the engines failed.Reza Nakhjavani, head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, has publicly stated that he blames yesterday's jet crash on pilot error. Nobody was killed when the Tupolev Tu-154 crash-landed and caught fire on the runway.Media reports at the time said the aircraft was performing an emergency landing in Mashad owing to a passenger requiring medical attention. Nakhjavani said that he is yet to see confirmation of this passenger's existance, and accused the pilot of placing one life before over 150 others; there were a combined 170 passengers and crew aboard.The Taban Air plane then crashed in the fog and caught fire. The aircraft sustained a tailstrike followed by landing gear failure and the right wing breaking. Forty-six people were injured and the Tu-154 burned on the runway. Nakhjavani claimed the pilot's actions were illegal and he had no clearance to land, also blaming Air Taban and stating they were negligent.Hamid Behbahani, Minister of Roads and Transportation, also blamed "human error" for both the air crash and a train accident the same day that killed nine people. However, he stated that the foggy weather conditions also played a role in the plane crash. Taban's license is currently suspended.Iran uses a number of Russian and Soviet-built aircraft, particularly Tupolevs. In recent years these have had a high accident rate. Last year a Tu-154 crash killed 168 people shortly after takeoff from Tehran heading to Yerevan, Armenia. It was the worst accident in Iranian aviation history. RIA Novosti has stated that this fleet is aging and in urgent need of maintenance and repair work, while Iran blames international sanctions which they claim prevent the import of spare parts except low-quality products from Russia.Regardless of the causes of the problems Iran has experienced with its Tupolevs, the nation today banned the import of any more Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft. Meanwhile, Russia has sent a team from the Interstate Aviation Committee to assist investigations. Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation the state which manufactured an aircraft typically asists any probe into an accident involving it.The Interstate Aviation Committee was set up after the collapse of the Soviet Union to replace the single body in place accross the USSR. If Iran concludes negligent pilot error was indeed to blame then the country cannot sanction the flight crew since they are employed by Russia's Federal Aviation Service. The Russian party to the investigation issues flight is responsible for licensing pilots.A Boeing 707 cargo plane, reported by local press as belonging to the Iranian military, crashed into houses in Karaj, near Tehran, the Iranian capital, yesterday. All but one of the sixteen on-board died; no deaths were reported on the ground, with local media reporting no-one was in the houses.The aircraft came down into a residential area between Fath Airport, where it was attempting to land, and Payam International Airport. Fath Airport is owned by the Revolutionary Guards. State media reported the cockpit voice recorder was recovered. The army said the plane was bringing meat from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan "to help the country's economy."Fars News said the crash involved pilot error. The lone survivor was a flight engineer. The entire crew were Iranians, the army said. Press TV said the crash was followed by a fire. Photographs showed the aircraft, sans wings, with the cockpit buried within a house and twisted engine parts strewn around.The Aviation Herald reported the failed landing at Fath, which has a much shorter runway than Payam, was a mistake and the jet was supposed to land at Payam. The industry publication stated the aircraft overran the runway and broke through a perimeter barrier. It cited the Air Force as stating Saha Airlines owned the plane, and claimed a reported sixteenth death. In 2018 another aircraft confused the two airports, performing an emergency go around at "very low height" according to The Aviation Herald.The Centre for Aviation's database of air carriers lists Saha as belonging to the Air Force and states it runs flights with Boeing 707s and Airbus A300s, but uses Boeing 747s for freight. Airfleets, a database detailing the aircraft operated by commercial carriers, states the aircraft uses the A300 and 747 as well as the Boeing 737. It does not, however, list any 707s. The Aviation Herald states the 707 was a freighter, despite photos showing a row of windows along each side; it lists a tail number of EP-CPP. Wikinews contacted Boeing in an effort to establish the plane's initial configuration when manufactured. Boeing did not release any specific information about the initial build, telling Wikinews the company "extends its profound condolences to the families and friends of those lost[...] as well as our best wishes for the recovery of those injured." Boeing referred to the 707 involved as a "cargo plane".Iran's air fleet is ageing, with sanctions restricting the purchase of both new planes and parts to maintain those already owned.A remote controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle killed a Tehran University nuclear physics professor, Massoud Ali Mohammadi, near his home in the Iranian capital.According to state run IRIB's website, "Ali-Mohammadi, a nuclear scientist and a committed and revolutionary Tehran University professor, was detonated by a remote control.""As a result of the bomb planted by Zionist (Israeli) and American agents two cars and a motorcycle were severely damaged and the windows in the surrounding residential units were shattered," stated IRIB."Iran’s police and security bodies are investigating the terrorist case to identify those behind it," Press TV reported on Tuseday. Press TV added that while no one had been arrested yet, a "handprint of Israeli intelligence services" was suspected in the event.Mehdi Mohammadifar, a senior official in the Interior Ministry, said the reason for the bombing was being investigated.Taban Air flight 6437 caught fire as it was landing at Mashhad International Airport in Iran at 7:20 A.M. local time (3:50 GMT) yesterday.There were no fatalities.  46 people were injured out of 157 passengers and 13 crew members aboard. The flight was scheduled to fly from Abadan to Mashhad, but it made an early landing due to severe weather at the destination and an ill passenger.As the flight landed amid poor visibility, the plane veered off the runway and gear collapsed, causing the tail to  hit the runway.  The right wing touched the ground, sheared off, and caught fire. The tail separated after the plane stopped and passengers were evacuated.  The runway suffered damage from the tail's impact.  It is not clear whether the tail caught fire before or after landing.The plane involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-154 with tail number RA-85787, built in the former Soviet Union.The Iranian Civil Aviation Authority has suspended Taban Air's license.A wheel on an Aseman Airlines Fokker 100 regional jet caught fire late on Tuesday night after landing in Isfahan, Iran following a flight from Tehran.It is unclear if the aircraft landed normally or experienced a hard landing, with accounts conflicting. It is known that after landing the crew noticed that the brake temperature in one of the wheels was unusually high as they left the runway, and requested that fire crews responded before the passengers disembarked.When emergency services arrived they discovered that the wheel was alight, and the fire was extinguished. The plane then proceeded to the ramp, and the passengers left the jet as normal. The plane subsequently departed as scheduled the following morning.Air accidents are common in Iran, which has an aging fleet that is poorly maintained both for civil and military operations. International sanctions have meant that new aircraft cannot be purchased. Earlier this week, a police helicopter crash killed three people and wounded three more. Last month Iran saw its worst air disaster in years when an airliner heading to Armenia crashed, killing the 168 on board. The same month saw another airliner overrun a runway at Mashhad and strike a wall, killing seventeen.An Iranian airliner overshot a runway in the Iranian city of Mashhad and crashed into a perimeter wall, smashing the front of the aircraft and leaving 17 dead and 19 injured.  This accident occurred less than 10 days after an Iranian airliner en route to the Armenian capital of Yerevan crashed, killing 168 people.  The Aria Aviation Company's Russian-built Ilyushin II-62 airliner landed near the middle of the runway, according to deputy transport minister Ahmad Majidi, and crashed into the perimeter wall before striking power lines and coming to a stop in adjacent farmland.  Thirteen of the dead were part of the crew, the rest were passengers.  Of the crew members, 9 were citizens of Kazakhstan, and the rest were Iranian citizens.  Officials say technical issues might have contributed to the crash.Following the incident, Iranian state television announced that Aria Airline's flying license was being suspended pending further investigation. Air safety experts accuse Iran of having a poor safety record. International sanctions on Iran have prevented it from buying modern Boeing or Airbus planes and parts. As a result, Iran is forced to use older Russian aircraft which are more prone to accidents.A suicide bomb attack in the Iraqi capital Baghdad yesterday has killed at least eighteen people, all of whom were either police officers or cadets. Voice of America has cited the death toll as nineteen. At least 26 injuries have also been reported as a result of the incident.According to police, the perpetrator detonated his car as police recruits exited the security barriers of a compound in the north-east of the city. A policeman informed Reuters of sighting "body parts scattered on the ground and boots and berets covered with blood" at the scene, as well as various vehicles burning.As of yet, no group has accepted responsibility for the suicide bombing. However, Al-Qaeda characteristically uses attacks of this nature, according to The Daily Telegraph.This attack is reportedly the deadliest in the country since 31 individuals were killed on January 27 as the result of a suicide bomb attack outside a Baghdad hospital, in which a vehicle filled with explosives was detonated.As many as 47 people are reported dead and 113 wounded as bombs and shooting erupted across Iraq Sunday. Baghdad and Baquba, particularly, each sustained multiple blasts. The United Nations says violence in Iraq July killed over 1,000 people, more than in any other month since 2008.  Sunni militants are reportedly gaining strength in Iraq.Amongst the incidents:  A car bomb near a Baquba housing complex killed 11 and wounded 34, according to police. Military sources said five soldiers were killed at a fake checkpoint near Qiyara, north of Baghdad, and their bodies were burned. In Madaen, two separate bombings reportedly killed seven and injured 30. Two explosions also rocked the capital, Baghdad, killing an additional twelve people and wounding 45, according to officials. A car bomb in Balad killed at least four and wounded several more, including a judge who was driving past.No group has claimed responsibility for the incidents.Iraqi police officials say that a car bomb detonated in the holy city of Najaf and killed at least three and wounded 50. The blast came just a day before the country goes to vote in their parliamentary elections.According to officials, the bomb was detonated near a bus carrying pilgrims. Two of the dead were from Iran while the other was from Iraq. Radwan al-Kindi, Director of the Najaf Health Department, confirmed the deaths.The disaster occurred near the Imam Ali shrine, in Najaf, which Shia pilgrims from Iran and Iraq frequent. Najaf lies 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Baghdad. The incident occurred despite the extra security measures in the country.Several people have died in the prelude to Iraq's second parliamentary poll since Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. 3000 people have been murdered last year in Baghdad alone. Officials from U.S. and Iraq have said that it is likely that insurgents would attempt to disrupt the elections with attacks.14 people were murdered in bomb attacks at two polling stations where early voting was taking place, Thursday. Thousands of Iraqis who had been exiled have been voting before Sunday's main polling day.A suicide bombing in Iraq has killed at least 55 people and injured at least 120 more, according to local police.The suicide bomber struck at a restaurant located about 2 miles north of the ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk on Thursday morning. The Abdullah restaurant, where the explosion took place, is popular among Kurdish officials. The attack comes on the Muslim religious holiday Eid al-Adha, known in English as the "Festival of Sacrifice". At the time the restaurant was struck, it was full of families marking the final day of Eid. Five women and three children were among the dead.Kirkuk is the scene of ongoing ethnic tensions, although the reasons for this attack in particular are currently unknown.Salam Abdullah, 45,  was one of the people in the restaurant at the time of the attack. "I held my wife and led her outside the place. As we were leaving, I saw dead bodies soaked with blood and huge destruction," he stated, commenting on his experiences. "We waited outside the restaurant for some minutes. Then an ambulance took us to the hospital."Awad al-Jubouri, who was injured in the incident, condemned the bombers. "I do not know how a group like al-Qaida claiming to be Islamic plans to attack and kill people on sacred days like Eid. We were only meeting to discuss our problems with the Kurds and trying to impose peace among Muslims in Kirkuk." Jubouri is a tribal leader, who was attending a lunch that was intended to precede a meeting discussing was to lessen tensions between local communities.Last July, an affiliated restaurant of the same name was the site of a suicide bombing which claimed the lives of six and wounded twenty five.Irish researchers predicted two weeks ago that there would be further earthquakes in the same region as the massive Boxing Day 2004 quake.On Monday night a massive 8.7 scale earthquake hit the island of Sumatra.On March 17, researchers at University of Ulster, Coleraine in northern Ireland published a report in the scientific journal Nature that showed stress was building on the fault near Sumatra and that the risk of a second powerful earthquake was increasing.The researchers said in the report that in subduction zones, a pair of massive earthquakes relatively close together is not uncommon. The last such incident was 1999 in Duzce, Turkey where a 7.4 magnitude quake was followed by a 7.1 magnitude quake three months later.In the Nature report, the researchers pointed to evidence suggesting that stresses in the fault near northern Sumatra were significantly higher than those of the 1999 Turkey rupture. The quake that eventually did strike Sumatra was exponentially more massive than the 7.0 to 7.5 magnitude quake the researches suggested in Nature. But it still was less powerful than the December 2004 quake and did not result in any life-threatening tsunami.A girls' school in the village of Kari Gar, within the tribal Khyber District, was blown up and destroyed by Islamist militants today morning. There were no reported deaths but four people passing by have been injured and a few homes in the neighbourhood have been slightly damaged.A boy who witnessed the scene is missing and local administration officials say that he has been probably kidnapped. There were two bombs planted in the government school of which all the eighteen rooms along with the building have been demolished.Schools had been closed after a suicide attack last month but many schools have opened recently.Islamist militants have often destroyed almost 200 schools in this semi-autonomous region on the border of Afghanistan. Pakistan is fighting against these Islamist militants in this area who have been causing problems in these areas.Israel scrambled two fighter jets to intercept a suspicious aircraft that was failing to respond to air traffic control (ATC) and had moved into attack positions, only to discover that it was carrying International Middle East peace envoy and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair.The aircraft was an executive private jet carrying delegates including Blair from Sinai, Egypt where they had attended the World Economic Forum to Bethlehem on Wednesday when the aircraft entered Israeli airspace and failed to respond to multiple demands from ATC to identify itself, it emerged yesterday. Amid terrorism fears, the Israeli Air Force scrambled two fighters as is standard procedure for unresponsive aircraft. These then manoeuvered themselves above and behind the aircraft, which is an aggressive position considered optimal should a shootdown be required.The fighters were then able to make direct contact with Tony Blair's flight, which then identified itself and informed the fighter pilots of who was on board. It later turned out the aircraft had suffered a technical fault that had prevented them hearing ATC's request for identification.Matthew Doyle, a spokesman for Blair who was on the flight, said "Mr. Blair was one of a number of delegates on a flight back from the World Economic Forum in Sharm e-Sheikh. We were not aware of any problem at the time, and have not been notified of any issue with the flight." He also said they only found out after reporters began asking them what had happened.The Israeli Defense Force refuses to comment on operational matters, but officials speaking anonymously have confirmed the incident occurred.Assaf Ramon, the pilot of an Israeli F-16 fighter jet, was killed on Sunday after his plane crashed in the West Bank, according to officials.Ramon was the eldest son of Israel's astronaut Ilan Ramon, who was one of six people killed in the February 2003 Columbia space shuttle explosion.The pilot's plane smashed into a hilly area near the city of Hebron, the Israeli military said, adding that the accident happened during a routine part of an advanced pilot course.  Search and rescue have been dispatched to the area.It was not immediately known what caused the jet to crash.Israel fired a missile into northern Gaza Strip, killing one person and wounding two. The Israeli army claimed it targeted militants placing explosives in an area close to Israeli troops.Palestinian security sources also said the Islamic University, a Hamas stronghold, in Gaza city were hit with no word of any casualties.The strikes were a part of an Israeli operation in Gaza to rescue Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier kidnapped earlier by Palestinian militants.A transport aircraft belonging to the Italian Air Force has crashed near Pisa. All five on board the C-130 Hercules were killed.The aircraft was on a training mission when it went down onto a railway line close to a military airport. It had been approaching for landing when it swerved to one side and crashed, according to Pisa's fire brigade. An electrical fire was triggered at the railway line, but no trains were endangered.The plane left the airport at 2:10 p.m. and was returning shortly after at the time of the accident. As well as the fire service, police, ambulances and airport rescue workers attended the scene. The crash was away from the main city and no-one on the ground was injured. An investigation has been launched.The Italian ambassador to South Africa died in a car accident Saturday while hunting and on a game viewing safari in Limpopo province. At least two others were injured, one seriously.Alessandro Cevese, 57, was traveling in a vehicle when it maneuvered to miss hitting an antelope. It is reported to have crossed the dirt road they were traveling on and when attempting to miss hitting it, the vehicle overturned and Cevese was thrown out of the car."The ambassador was flung from the car window and died instantly," said counselor Pier Folano. Authorities will be performing a culpability homicide investigation into the accident.Cevese had served as Italy's ambassador to Lesotho, Mauritius and Madagascar and South Africa since July 2006. He was an attorney with experience in diplomacy.Cevese is survived by his wife and three children.Italian goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini has been seriously injured in a motorcycle accident in London. The player, who plays for Tottenham Hotspurs, was involved in a collision with a car at 10:30 GMT. The football club reported that he has fractured his wrists and injured his pelvis. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police released a statement saying "A 36-year-old male suffered injuries described by the London Ambulance Service as possibly life-changing and was taken to Whipps Cross Hospital for further assessment and treatment". No arrests have been made. Cudicini crashed his motorcycle into a Ford Fiesta with a female driver and a child passenger. Neither the driver or passenger were injured in the accident. Cudicini is the son of former AC Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini. During his career he has played for Lazio, AC Milan and Chelsea. He played for Chelsea for 10 years until he was transferred to Tottenham in January. He made one appearance for the Italian national team.In his first public speech since the fatal shooting that killed an Italian Intelligence agent in Iraq, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has rejected the version of events presented by the US administration. The intelligence agent, Nicola Calipari, was escorting freed hostage, Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena, when their car came under fire by US troops on the journey to Baghdad airport last week, leaving Nicola Calipari dead and Giuliana Sgrena and another intelligence agent wounded. Mr Berlusconi has disputed US claims that the car was speeding and also said that the US military had known of and authorised the car's journey. Berlusconi's speech to parliament comes a day after his Foreign Minister, Gianfranco Fini made a similar speech to lawmakers, where he refuted Ms. Sgrena's claims that the shooting was the result of an ambush. The US began their official investigation on March 8, four days after the shooting. The results are yet to be determined.However in a statement given immediately after the attack by the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division, who controls Baghdad, said that Italian officials had given no advance warning to the US Army of their journey, and that the car was speeding and refused to stop. One Army official stated that the car was traveling over 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour) and almost hydroplaned several times, an assertion that Sgrena herself seemingly corroborated in her article for Il Manifesto."The United States has no intention of evading the truth. I'm sure that in a very short time every aspect of this will be clarified." Mr Berlusconi said, describing the shooting as an "accident." Adding that he expected the findings of an investigation into the shooting, being led by a US brigadier general, in cooperation with Italian authorities, to be released in three to four weeks.Meanwhile the office of Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said that it had received a letter from  U.S. President George Bush saying that the shooting was a "terrible tragedy" and that "President Bush assures President Ciampi that the United States will move toward a swift and exhaustive joint investigation."Recently, the Associated Press and the Italian RAI TGI television released photos of the car after the attack by American soldiers.[1], [2] The pictures show little visible damage to the vehicle. Sgrena claims that the American soldiers fired between 300 and 400 rounds at the car from an armoured vehicle. This is disputed by the US military, as a tank or other fighting vehicle would likely have entirely destroyed the car.98 people, including 24 children, were found Saturday by Italian police in the sewer system of Rome.The Afghan youths were reported to be between the ages of 10 and 15. According to the newspaper La Repubblica, the children had stowed away on trailer trucks traveling from Turkey and Greece.  They had spent nights sleeping in a standing position in filthy sewer pipes after removing the manhole covers and some of them were found in a sickly condition.There had been reports to the police of children under the Ostiense train station, a common place for the homeless to seek shelter on cold nights.The children, who do not speak Italian, are under the care of Rome's Social Services. Efforts are being made by interpreters to identify the children who traveled without parental care.Save the Children said that Afghan minors in Rome have increased to 264 in 2007 from 32 in 2004.The Italian Interior Ministry has collaborated with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to produce an on- and offline media campaign aimed at discouraging refugees from entering Europe. The campaign, titled "Aware Migrants", was launched Thursday, exposing high levels of violence and danger in transit, and discouraging migrants from attempting passage through illegal trafficking.The €1.5million campaign features videos on social media to target the 16–35 age demographic, believed to be most likely to attempt the move. The videos are to include testimonials from more than 150 refugees, citing rape, child abuse, and exposure as potential threats. Each video concludes with the phrase "Be aware, brother" or "Be aware, sister". This slogan is also thematic in Malian musician's Rokia Traoré's official campaign song: "Be aware brother, be aware sister".Italy's Interior Minister, Angelino Alfano, said they will still welcome refugees fleeing war, but that others may be declined. Recent large numbers of arrivals and migrant deaths has been cited as the reason behind the campaign, with the Interior Ministry recording over 70,000 refugees arriving in Italy in the first half of 2016. Federico Soda, the Director of the IOM Coordination Office for the Mediterranean, asserts most of those migrants did not expect the level of danger involved in transit. Migrants are invited to share their own experiences in response to the videos posted on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, in order to spread the warning to other potential migrants.FIFA, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association or International Federation of Association Football, has fined the Ivorian Football Federation $47,000 over the stadium disaster on March 29. Between 20 and 22 football fans died and over 130 were injured as 36,000 fans packed into the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Stadium to see the Ivory Coast face Malawi in a qualifying match for the FIFA World Cup. The stadium's capacity is 34,600 fans. The stampede took place after a wall collapsed as thousands of fans massed outside the stadium, trying to get in. The game was played despite the accident, and the Ivory Coast won 5&ndasp0.FIFA imposed a sanction of 50,000 Swiss francs, approximately US$46,800. They also set a 20,000 attendance limit on the next qualifier, against Burkina Faso. In addition, they have called for a mandatory traffic control cordon. FIFA has donated US$96,000 to a fund which supports the families of those who lost their lives in the disaster. "In the event of any similar incidents, FIFA would have no choice but to impose more severe sanctions on the Ivorian Football Association," read a statement released by FIFA. The government of the Ivory Coast has opened its own investigation into the disaster.File:RyanDunn-HOB.jpgRyan Dunn, one of the stars of the TV series Jackass, has died in a car accident aged 34. The accident occurred near West Chester, Pennsylvania early yesterday morning, when the car Dunn was driving left the road and crashed into a tree. The vehicle burst into flames; Dunn's body was identified by his tattoos. An unidentified passenger also died in the accident. Police suspect speed to have been a factor.Dunn's death was announced by April Margera, the mother of one of his co-stars, Bam Margera. MTV released a statement saying "We are devastated by the tragic loss of Ryan Dunn — a beloved member of the MTV family for more than a decade."Jackass started in 2000 after a series of internet clips were released showing Dunn skateboarding and performing stunts along with Margera, Christopher Raab and Brandon DiCamillo. The show was created after Johnny Knoxville contacted the group to ask if he could use their videos on the show.As well as the TV series and three Jackass movies, Dunn also appeared on Viva La Bam and presented his own shows, Homewrecker and Proving Ground.Chinese state news today declared Jade Rabbit, China's first moon rover, irreparably damaged.The Chang'e 3 lander, the first lunar lander for 37 years and of the third nationality, touched down and launched Jade Rabbit in December. Jade Rabbit was designed to spend three months seeking out natural resources but has not functioned since a fault was discovered on January 25.The probes have to shut down for two weeks each month to survive the "lunar night", during which surface temperature drops to -180 °C or less. The first lunar night of the mission was weathered successfully but Chinese scientists suspected the rover had failed on the 25th when the second night rolled in. Communication could only be attempted when the night ended on Monday, but reactivation efforts failed and the rover is now confirmed derelict.State-owned Xinhua news agency blamed the fault on "the complicated lunar surface environment". Only the US and ex-USSR had previously landed rovers on the moon, with China and the States fueling renewed interest in Earth's natural satellite as a possible source of minerals.Firefighters have confirmed that the large James Bond sound stage at Pinewood Studios has been destroyed by fire. It is thought eight fire engines were called to the scene near Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire on Sunday morning, where filming for Casino Royale, the latest Bond movie, has been completed. Jen McVean witnessed the event, and she said the stage was “completely on fire”. The set had been transformed into a replica of the Italian city of Venice, but Mrs McVean, who owns a firm at the studios, said: “Nothing is salvageable and there are many, many fire engines there.” One spokesman said around 40 to 50 firefighters were at the scene. It is reported that fire damage caused the building’s roof to fall in and firefighters were damping the flames down with specialist equipment. “We do not know the extent of the damage to the 007 stage, although it is believed to be significant,” a spokesman for Pinewood Studios said. “Filming was not taking place. A production had completed filming and its film sets were in the process of being removed,” he added.No one was reported injured in the incident.Pinewood, which was created in 1935, was the filming ground for Dr No, the first ever James Bond movie in 1962. It merged with Shepperton Studios in 2001, and high-budget movies like Harry Potter and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory have since been filmed there.  In 1984, a sound stage caught fire, but it reopened in January 1985 and was named the Albert Brocolli sound stage in honour of the man who produced many Bond films. In 1997, Pinewood was hit by fire again after flames broke out in the roof of a sound building where The Avengers was being recorded.Floods during the month of January have devastated Singapore. A major flood occurred from January 11 to January 12, 2007, during which almost 24 cm of rain fell, resulting in a landslide. A second major flood recently occurred at Kota Tinggi, leaving 17 people and 12 monkeys dead. As of January 31, 30,000 people still reside in relief centers in w:Johor.Almost 24 cm of rain fell in two days in northern Singapore, disrupting business operations in the area and triggering a landslide in Jalan Anak Bukit. The continuous rainfall, over 18 hours on Thursday, January 11 and Friday January 12, resulted in a landslide which caused the closure of a road that heads toward the Pan Island Expressway.The MacRitchie Reservoir station recorded 216.7 millimeters of rainfall during the 24 hour period, accounting for 90 percent of the January average of 241 millimeters.Recent flooding of the Johor river has caused vast destruction in Kota Tinggi. According to a Malaysian official, the flooding may be due to the land reclamation efforts made by Singapore. The reclamation project has reportedly narrowed the mouth of the Johor river, slowing the flow of water into the Johor Straits. About 100,000 people have been evacuated from their homes because of flooding during December and January.In 2002, Singapore began land reclamation at the Johor Straits in an effort to  reclaim Pulau Tekong. Malaysia opposed the project and sought international arbitration proceedings during October of 2003. Malaysia has reported that the project has hurt their interests by narrowing shipping lanes at the Johor Straits. Singapore expects the reclamation to be finished by 2010.Malaysia has provided about US$430 million of aid by sheltering flood victims and rebuilding roads and schools. Flood water as high as four meters has caused 17 deaths and restricted access to many villages and towns.Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes affected the midwestern and southern United States yesterday into today with damage reported in several states and at least two people killed. In Mississippi, at least ten counties suffered power outages, and the National Weather Service reported a tornado struck areas near the town of Sardis. At least 11,900 customers were without power in Indiana, where debris blocked roadways and a tornado reportedly damaged homes in the town of Solsberry. In Tennessee major damage was reported around the Nashville area with widespread tree and some building damage reported. One man was killed in Nashville when a tree fell on a building he was using as shelter, according to police. An EF2 tornado was also confirmed to have touched down in the town of Mount Juliet.Damage was also reported in Georgia, where a tornado caused extensive damage in Adairsville, and one person was reported killed. Damage and flipped vehicles resulted in the closure of Interstate 75 at Adairsville. The Storm Prediction Center and National Climatic Data Center said the fatality in Adairsville was the first tornado-related fatality in the United States in 220 days, since a deadly tornado in Florida June 24, ending the longest recorded time between tornado fatalities in the United States. The threat for severe weather is expected to continue into tonight as the storm system continues to push east, with the possibility of damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes.A tsunami alert has been issued by the Japanese Meteorological Agency after a 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck the Kuril islands. The alert warns that a 2 metre high tsunami could hit the Pacific coast of Hokkaido & Honshu 1210 GMT. Coastal residents have been asked to move to higher ground.The United States Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has warned that the tsunami will hit northern Japan and Russia. An official from the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center as said that the tsunami was not expected to hit Hawaii and the West Coast of North and South America. She added that there was a slight chance of it hitting the  western Aleutian Islands.The United States Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre warning states indicates the estimated inital tsunami arrival times as follows.NOTE: ACTUAL ARRIVAL TIMES MAY DIFFER AND THE INITIAL WAVE MAY NOT BE THE LARGEST. THE TIME BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE TSUNAMI WAVES CAN BE FIVE MINUTES TO ONE HOUR. IN CASE OF CONFLICTING INFORMATION... THEMORE CONSERVATIVE INFORMATION SHOULD BE USED FOR SAFETY.Japan's Transportation Safety Board has blamed a combination of poor design and a maintenance error for a fire and explosions that destroyed a passenger jet.The China Airlines Boeing 737-800 had landed at Naha Airport in 2007 and had just parked and shut its engines down when a fire broke out on the right hand engine, quickly moving to the wing and the tarmac beneath. Ground staff alerted the crew and an evacuation commenced.In just three minutes and 27 seconds all the 157 passengers had evacuated, but the flight crew remained. The first officer was midway through evacuating and the captain still in the cockpit when the first explosion occurred, blasting the first officer to the ground. The captain escaped immediately afterwards and no-one was injured. It was approximately five minutes before the first airport fire engine began to spray foam on the fuselage, by which time two more explosions had occurred. The structure collapsed shortly afterwards while other fire crews arrived from both the airport and the city.The final report has confirmed that during mandatory scheduled maintenance conducted per Boeing's recommendations about a month and a half prior to the jet's destruction, a washer had come off a bolt in the wing. As a result, the bolt had fallen off. When the jet arrived at Naha, it used its slats to assist the landing.However, the bolt had worked its way into the track that one of these slats moved on, and as the slat was retracted after the landing the bolt became trapped between the slat and a fuel tank, which it punched through. Fuel then leaked out and dribbled onto the hot engine, starting the fire that then consumed the aircraft. The fire only started when the engine was shut down, as before then the fuel had been blown away by the force produced.The report criticised the design of the bolt, as it "was unable to prevent the assembly from falling off if the washer is not installed." It further commented that neither Boeing nor China Airlines had considered the fact that the bolt's location was difficult to access when planning the maintenance to the aircraft. The fact that maintenance workers had not reported the difficulty of the work was also found to have contributed to the washer's absence going undetected. As part of the job, the nut on the end of the bolt was replaced, but the engineer couldn't see the bolt's head and didn't check the washer.As a result of the accident the aviation authorities of Boeing's and China Airlines' home countries — the United States and Taiwan respectively — have been sent recommendations to review procedures to ensure the accident cannot be repeated.The official death toll from the devastating Japanese earthquake that hit on Friday is now nearing 1,900, while police officials say that it is all but certain the final toll will be at least 10,000 people dead.Bodies are still being recovered—2,000 thus far in the Miyagi Prefecture alone.  The official count of those missing has now reached 2,300, though in one town alone, an estimated half of the 17,000 person population is still unaccounted for.  Approximately 350,000 people have been left without homes; shelters are providing housing for the moment.Due to infrastructure damage, survivors in the hard-hit northeast coast of Japan are coping with limited resources, including food, water and electricity. In the Iwate Prefecture, a government official stated that the incoming goods from relief efforts are only about ten percent of what is necessary.At the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, a second explosion occurred on Monday at the building housing Reactor 3, following an explosion Saturday at the Reactor 1 building. Reactor 2 was also reported to have difficulties with its cooling system.According to the Italian-based National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the magnitude 8.9 earthquake that struck Japan on Friday caused the axis of the planet Earth to shift by approximately ten centimetres. Experts believe that "this has [shifted] the axis of rotation of the Earth [further] than the 2004 earthquake in Sumatra." ((fr))French language: ‍ce phénomène a exercé sur l'axe de rotation de la Terre une action plus importante que le séisme de 2004 à SumatraAccording to La Nación, the impact of the Japanese earthquake caused an energy release one hundred times larger than that of the earthquake which struck Haiti in 2010. Leading the research at the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, Antonio Piersanti stated that "[o]ur estimate is not derived from direct measurements, which require much more time, but theoretical calculations." ((es))Spanish language: ‍Nuestra estimación no se deriva de mediciones directas, que requerirán mucho más tiempo, sino de cálculos teóricosRichard Gross, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was responsible for discovering the extent to which the Earth's axis had been shifted by the 2010 Chile earthquake. He claimed that there "should be no impact [from] this change in rotation on daily life." ((es))Spanish language: ‍No debería haber ningún impacto de este cambio en la rotación sobre la vida diariaGross explained: "Although we have not evaluated the measurements of the Earth's rotation, my calculations indicate that the change in the distribution of land masses caused by the Japanese earthquake may have caused the Earth to rotate a little faster, shortening the length of day about 1.6 microseconds." ((es))Spanish language: ‍Aunque todavía no hemos evaluado las mediciones de la rotación de la Tierra, mis cálculos indican que el cambio de la distribución de la masa terrestre causado por el terremoto japonés puede haber hecho que la Tierra rote un poco más rápido, acortando la duración del día unos 1,6 microsegundos He said that despite the fact that "[t]his change in the position of the axis of rotation will cause the Earth to wobble a bit different[ly] as it rotates," ((es))Spanish language: ‍Este cambio en la posición del eje de rotación de la Tierra hará que se tambalee un poco diferente, ya que gira the planet's axis would not alter in space.Amongst the aftermath of a magnitude 8.9 earthquake which struck on Friday, followed by a tsunami, Naoto Kan, the prime minister of Japan,  claimed that the country is experiencing its largest difficulties since the end of World War II in 1945. "The current situation of the earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear plants is in a way the most severe crisis in the past 65 years since World War II," Kan said. Speaking on television, he stated that "[w]hether we Japanese can overcome this crisis depends on each of us. I strongly believe that we can get over this great earthquake and tsunami by joining together."Kan reported that there were limited supplies of electricity due to the closure of numerous power stations, including a nuclear power plant located in Fukushima Prefecture. According to NHK, a broadcasting organization in Japan, approximately 310,000 individuals have been transported to safety in shelters that, in various cases, do not contain electricity.The Government of Japan has reported the deaths of one thousand individuals, although thousands of others have not been taken into account. The police have claimed that the death toll in the Miyagi Prefecture as a result of the earthquake and tsunami could be in excess of ten thousand. 100,000 troops - which equates to approximately 40% of the country's armed forces - are said to have been committed to assisting with the survivors of the disasters.The nuclear agency of Japan consider the circumstances at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant to be Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which is an accident with local consequences. According to BBC News Online, incidents like this usually cause one person to die from causes related to radiation. No individuals from the power plant are reported to have died.File:Fukushima-1.JPGJapanese officials have admitted for the first time that certain radiation-stricken areas around the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant may remain uninhabitable for decades. Japanese media this week reported that embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan is to visit affected areas within days to tell residents and local officials that it will remain too dangerous to return to parts of Fukushima Prefecture in the foreseeable future.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said, "We cannot deny the possibility that there will be some areas where it will be hard for residents to return to their homes over a long period of time."The dangers of radiation exposure in certain areas are expected to remain unacceptably high well after the plant finally undergoes a cold shutdown in the coming months. A final decision on which areas are to be declared off-limits will be made following detailed radiation monitoring and the creation of a comprehensive decontamination plan. Japanese officials have so far declined to specifically name any areas likely to be affected. Scientists have for months warned of such an eventuality following the meltdown of three reactors at the Fukushima site in March. The government, criticised for its management of evacuations in the wake of the disaster, had hoped to lift current evacuation orders for most areas around the plant. However, it cannot do so amidst dangerously elevated radiation readings, including in the town of Okuma, situated about three kilometres from the Fukushima site, where cumulative radiation levels are over 25 times higher than government-mandated limits.Media reports have also focused on uncertainty surrounding compensation for the many thousands of residents affected by the ongoing evacuations. The government may possibly purchase or rent the properties of those who cannot return to their homes and businesses. Although the plant operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, has recently claimed radiation leaks from all three reactors have declined, concern continues to mount over the true scale of contamination. Scientists have detected widespread contamination of topsoil on agricultural land, further jeopardising the future habitability of significant areas, and uncertainty remains as to the true extent of radioactivity in numerous areas.“Caesium-137, the main radioactive element thrown out during the various explosions, has a half-life of 30 years, and it is not going to disappear overnight,” said Didier Champion, a French nuclear safety expert.As the nuclear crisis in Japan's crippled Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant appears to worsen, Japan’s nuclear safety agency raised their assessment of its severity from 4 to 5 on the 7-level International Nuclear Event Scale, the same rating given the 1979 Three Mile Island crisis. Japan's Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, said bluntly that the situation at the nuclear power plant was "very grave". Weather forecasts indicate changing winds may begin moving radiation closer to Tokyo by March 30.Efforts thus far to  cool nuclear fuel in the  reactors and the  spent-fuel pools has produced little if any success, contends United States government officials.Engineers are working frantically to connect electrical power to two reactors in the plant, as well as to restart the cooling systems and  prevent overheating of fuel rods. Tokyo Electric Power Co. stated that it hopes to reconnect a power line needed to restart water pumps to the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors by Saturday morning.  However, a TEPCO official cautioned  that if the water pumps were damaged by the tsunami, they could fail to restart. The extent of the damage to the plant's reactors is still unclear. Japanese officials have concentrated  on cooling spent fuel rods in  Reactor No. 3's  storage pool. On Friday, however, steam was seen rising from Reactor No. 2., where an explosion occurred on Tuesday. Additionally, engineers said on Thursday that the steel lining of the storage pool at Reactor No. 4 and its concrete base seemed damaged, as  attempts to refill the pool with water became increasingly difficult.In a briefing on Friday, Philippe Jamet, a commissioner at France's nuclear regulator Autorite de Surete Nucleaire,  said, "We must avoid being overly optimistic. This will likely take human intervention like going into control rooms to reconnect valves."Radiation at Japan's damaged Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant yesterday spiked to lethal levels around a leaking tank. Today the national Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) said contaminated water may be pumped into the sea.Tanks holding contaminated water at the site continue to leak; operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) says up to 300 metric tons may have leaked from one tank alone. Radiation at that tank soared to 1,800 millisieverts per hour yesterday, a rate lethal to an exposed human in about four hours. Japanese law says nuclear workers cannot be exposed to more than 50 millisieverts in a year.TEPCO says other locations at the plant have readings of 70–230 millisieverts per hour. Waste water totalling more than 300,000 tons has already been collected at the site; more is being stored at a rate of 400 tons per day. An unknown quantity of radioactive groundwater is flowing into the sea.NRA boss Shinichi Tanaka told a press conference today that stored water may be pumped into the Pacific after treatment to reduce contamination to within legal limits. "I'm afraid that it is unavoidable to dump or release the water into the sea," he said, adding "careless management" was being applied to the water by TEPCO. TEPCO first noticed a leak at the now-deadly tank in July but said it was minor and the NRA gave it a level one "anomaly" rating on the seven-part international scale. Last week that was raised to "serious incident", level three, after TEPCO said up to 300 tons of water had leaked. The exact amount is unknown as there is no gauge to measure levels inside the tank and TEPCO staff had said water levels in the tank had remained constant.Last week levels under the tank, where lost water is thought to have seeped into the ground, stood at 100 millisieverts per hour, and another at the facility had a level of 70 millisieverts per hour. TEPCO found another leak yesterday in a pipe between coolant tanks. Highly radioactive material was dripping out, but TEPCO says the leak is now fixed. Monitoring at the site has been increased since the original leak's discovery two weeks ago.Around 1,000 tanks are used to store water from the power plant's coolant system, which was contaminated when three reactors melted down after a tsunami in March 2011. Around 160,000 people were evacuated in the worst nuclear disaster since 1986. Tanaka said "The situation at Fukushima is changing everyday... The accident has yet to be settled down."The new radiation involves beta rays, TEPCO said, which can be stopped with a sheet of metal. Water treatment has extracted caesium from the tanks but other radioactive elements remain. TEPCO's equipment to remove other contamination is out of action due to filter corrosion after a few months of operating, but the government has demanded it be returned to service this month.None of the tanks have monitoring equipment and TEPCO's initial procedure involved two employees manually checking each tank over a two-hour period. Since the tank was found to be leaking the total monitoring staff has increased from ten to 60, and patrols are carried out four times a day instead of twice a day.Prosecutors brought criminal charges against TEPCO and government officials including then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan for their handling of the crisis formed after the tsunami. Daily newspaper Sankei Shimbun today claimed all charges, brought after local residents complained, were to be dropped. Sankei Shimbun suggests a formal announcement may come within days.Kansai Electric Power today began shutting down one of only two reactors still generating power in Japan, reactor #3 at Oi Nuclear Power Plant, for mandatory inspection. The other, Oi's reactor #4, is to be permanently switched off this month. When the accident began nuclear energy supplied a third of Japan's power requirements, but in the aftermath of Fukushima the nation has switched to fossil fuels.Japanese officials have requested that inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspect the damage that occurred at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant during a strong 6.8 magnitude earthquake on July 16. The quake caused a leak in a pipe, which sent radioactive water into the Sea of Japan and the quake tipped over as many as 400 barrels of nuclear waste.At least five government officials have written a letter to the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, requesting that the IAEA inspect the damage because local residents are experiencing "great unease" about the radiation leak that occurred after the quake hit."Furthermore, images of the accident have been broadcast everywhere around the world and are creating misunderstandings. It is making this country's citizens uneasy, too, and may lead to harmful rumors about the prefecture's tourism and agriculture industries," said the letter.Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the IAEA has offered to put together a special team of inspectors and experts to go to the country if Japanese officials request their assistance."The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has told the IAEA that it will accept the inspection of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant of Tokyo Electric Power Co.," said unnamed Japanese officials according to Reuters though inspectors are not immediately requested.Japan has been lashed relentlessly by Typhoon Nabi, with nine meter high waves and torrential downpours. It had been classified as a Category 4 storm, the same strength as the recent Hurricane Katrina in the United States, but was later downgraded to Category 3.Flood warnings were issued from north Okinawa to Tokyo. Rain amounts were predicted to be greater than 19 inches (483 millimeters) for Kyushu, Japan's third largest island, and some areas may receive as much as 1 to 2 inches of rain per hour. "Water was almost reaching the second floor. I was really frightened," said a woman in her 50s. The typhoon knocked power and water out for thousands of homes and has so far claimed two lives, including one man struck by lightning.  Over 500 people were evacuated on the Northern Mariana Islands of Saipan, Tinian and Rota.Nabi is expected to swerve eastward over the next 24 hours and is likely to continue battering much of Japan and the southern and eastern parts of South Korea.A seven-car commuter train carrying 580 passengers jumped off the tracks, plowed through a car, and collided with a nine-story apartment building in Amagasaki, Japan on Monday at 9:18 am local time (00:18 UTC). The crash was about 410km west of Tokyo near Osaka in the  Hyogo prefecture.Casualties have risen to 101 deaths and at least 440 injuries. The train had 600 people on board at the time, including crew. Rescue workers swarmed the scene where two of the rail cars were flattened against walls of the apartment building.It appears that excessive speed was a factor in the wreck. Investigators are focusing on the 23-year-old driver who overshot the last station on the line before the wreck, and had received a warning in the past for a similar incident.The accident is the worst rail disaster since 1963, when a three-train crash killed 161. The rail is part of the West Japan Railway Co of Fukuchiyama Line. The rail president Takeshi Kakiuchi publicly apologized, telling reporters, "Our most important task now is to rescue the passengers from the accident and we are doing our best."Japan has one of the world's most complex and widely used rail systems.The death toll from the Sendai earthquake has now increased to over ten thousand. In Japan, the National Police Agency has stated that 10,019 are now known to have been killed as a result of the disaster.The Agency also reported that 2,775 had been injured and the location of 17,541 individuals was unknown. Meanwhile, 1,900 evacuation sites are now thought to be occupied by approximately a quarter of a million people.When the event happened two weeks ago, 18,000 thousand households were destroyed and 130,000 were damaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. In spite of this, twelve of the fifteen north-eastern ports of Japan have recommenced operating, while the majority of the oil terminals of the country remained open, according to Inchcape Shipping Services.Amongst the aftermath of the earthquake, plant number 3 at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant is suspected to have been damaged and may be releasing radiation. The Japanese government have reported that an ongoing investigation is occurring to attempt to discover the cause of the radiation leak at the power plant. Chinese authorities have reported two Japanese tourists were found to have levels of radiation "seriously exceeding limits" on their clothing and luggage. In Tokyo, the amount of radiation in the supply of water has decreased, however it remains high in various parts of the north of Japan.According to BBC News Online, two workers were hospitalised because of the leak. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), who operate the building, reported that three employees placing electrical cables at the location were given treatment for being exposed to radioactive water; they had experienced ten thousand times the regular amount of radioactivity. Of those three men, beta rays caused two of them to receive burns. The two individuals did not stop working despite meters advising of unsafe radiation levels. It was later discovered that they were wearing inadequate protective footwear and failed to draw their attention to a radiation alert. TEPCO has since received government orders to improve worker management.The radiation emitted from the plant has had a significant effect on the Japanese food industry. In the surrounding areas of the plant, shipments of foodstuffs have been prohibited. In Fukushima prefecture, residents have been advised not to consume eleven leafy green vegetable types produced locally due to radiation concerns. There has also been a significant decrease in customer demand at a fish market in Tsukiji.Japanese product importers have discovered some foodstuffs to have a small radiation amount, which is not thought to be potentially deadly. Numerous Asian countries, the European Union, Australia, Russia and the United States have prohibited milk items, seafood and vegetables from being imported from various Japanese prefectures.Closing the power plant down may take at least one month to achieve. Speaking to AFP, an individual talking on behalf of TEPCO stated that the company is "still in the process of assessing the damage at the plant, so that we can't put a deadline on when the cooling operations will work again". Residents living within thirty kilometres of the plant have been advised to avoid going outdoors to attempt to prevent radiation exposure as far as possible.Akihito, the emperor of Japan, has made a live appearance on national television saying he was "deeply worried" after the earthquake and tsunami that hit last Friday. The emperor made his announcement shortly after technicians working to stabilise a nuclear plant temporarily abandoned it as radiation started to surge.The emperor's appearance caused television stations to interrupt scheduled  programming. During his appearance he said  "I hope from the bottom of my heart that the people will, hand in hand, treat each other with compassion and overcome these difficult times." The 77 year-old is deeply respected in Japan.A statement by the Imperial household said Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko want to visit the area affected by the tsunami, but the important thing now is rescuing the victims. In 1995 the emperor and empress visited Kobe after an earthquake struck and killed 6,400 people.Around 10,000 people are feared to be dead after the earthquake and tsunami hit the north-east coast of the country. More than 100 countries have offered rescue services in an attempt to save as many people as possible.Radiation levels have rocketed in the sea near the Fukushima I nuclear plant in Fukushima, Japan, as government officials  admitted on Wednesday they are fighting a constant battle to halt the growing nuclear crisis which began after the devastating earthquake and tsunami which struck the country earlier this month. The news comes after the chief executive of plant operator Tepco, Masataka Shimizu, was hospitalized with exhaustion on Tuesday.Levels of Iodine-131 off the coast of the plant were recorded to be almost 3,400 times the legal limit, the Japanese nuclear safety authority, Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (Nisa), said. The levels of radiation are the highest recorded since the crisis began. Officials are now struggling to find how radiation is leaking from the plant, and have prohibited fishing in the area. A spokesperson for Nisa insisted there was no immediate threat to humans from the leakage into the sea. "We will find out how it happened and do our utmost to prevent [the levels of radiation] from rising," he said.The situation at the nuclear plant is considered dire after the Japanese government accepted an offer of assistance from the United States and France. An experienced nuclear engineer has warned the reactor core at No. 2 reactor at the plant may have melted. Workers at the plant are battling to cool the reactors and stop further radiation leakage.If the crisis continues to escalate, the Japanese economy could sustain serious damage as fisherman are banned from working in the area of contaminated water. "The worst-case scenario is that this drags on not one month or two months or six months, but for two years, or indefinitely," an analyst, based in Tokyo, said. "Japan will be bypassed. That is the real nightmare scenario." A spokesperson for the Japanese government warned officials "are not yet in a situation" to say when the race to avert the crisis from escalating will end.Masataka Shimizu, the chief executive of Tepco, was transported to hospital with dizziness and hypertension as criticism of the company continues to build. Last week, three workers stepped into contaminated cooling water as they tried to replace cables at one of the reactors of the plant and two were hospitalized. The workers have  now been released from the hospital.Tepco has apologized to those affected by the nuclear emergency in a statement released March 18. "We sincerely apologize to all the people living in the surrounding area of the power station and people in Fukushima Prefecture, as well as to the people of society for causing such great concern and nuisance," the company said in the statement. The sale of numerous vegetables grown near the plant has been banned by authorities after they tested positive for radiation. Officials have also warned parents not to give tap water to infants after it emerged that it may have become contaminated. A large area around the plant has been evacuated.The operators of the stricken Fukushima I nuclear power plant in northeast Japan have been ordered to pay compensation to families affected by the ongoing crisis at the site, amid calls for the resignation of the Japanese prime minister over how he is handling the crisis, which has now been designated on par with the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.Japanese officials ordered TEPCO to pay ¥1 million (US$12 thousand,£7.35 thousand) to each household affected by the crisis, which the company says will add up to approximately ¥50 billion (US$599 million,£367 million). Earlier this week, officials announced plans to expand the nuclear exclusion zone around the plant to include five more communities as radiation continues to leak from the plant. Pressure is now mounting for the resignation of Naoto Kan, the Japanese prime minister, for his handling of the nuclear crisis in Fukushima; some of his opponents have called for an independent inquiry into how he reacted to the disaster. TEPCO has this week announced plans to move equipment to higher ground after a series of strong aftershocks that have hampered efforts to repair the crippled facility. Officials have warned some of the nuclear rods in the reactors at the plant may have been damaged, but likely remain intact. Workers at the plant are still fighting a desperate battle to stop radiation leaking from the plant, but have been hit by constant setbacks. Earlier this week officials of NISA, the Japanese government nuclear authority, said officials had upgraded the crisis to a level seven on the International Nuclear Event Scale—the same applied to the Chernobyl disaster—designating the crisis as a "major accident" with "wider consequences" than previously thought. "We have upgraded the severity level to seven as the impact of radiation leaks has been widespread from the air, vegetables, tap water and the ocean," he said. Akihito, the emperor of Japan, travelled to the northeast of the country on Wednesday to visit survivors of the tsunami which devastated the area last month against a backdrop of mounting anger over the  at a nuclear plant, where technicians are continuing to battle to cool the reactors as radiation continues to leak from the site. Akihito and his wife, Michiko, met people displaced by the tragedy at two emergency shelters in Asahi, near the northeast coast where the tsunami struck. 140,000 people are now living in emergency shelters across Japan after their homes were destroyed in the disaster.Emergency workers, dressed in protective white suits, gloves and goggles, have began searching for bodies within the exclusion zone around the stricken nuclear plant, much of which was left muddied and destroyed by the tsunami. Officials fear up to 1,000 bodies may be among the wreckage in the area. Search efforts in the area have been put off because of high radiation levels, but authorities want to recover bodies before they deteriorate to the point where they become a health hazard and impossible to identify.Japanese television reported radiation levels in the ocean off the plant have fallen but remain high. Health officials have found radiation 25 times the legal limit in fish caught south of the nuclear plant, and radioactivity had been detected in 11 different vegetables in Fukushima earlier this week.  The death toll from the disaster is continuing to rise; Japanese police have reported 13,300 people have been confirmed dead and more than 15,000 are still missing.Another aftershock, with a magnitude of 6.1, struck on Thursday morning, following a more powerful one, measuring magnitude 6.6, on Monday. Hundreds of aftershocks have rattled northeast Japan in the month since the initial earthquake. Before the aftershock on Monday, people across Japan marked the one month anniversary of the earthquake with a moment of silence, and Kan paid tribute to countries who had sent aid to the stricken country. However, Kan has been criticised for his handling of the nuclear crisis. An entrepreneur in Fukushima, Yoshihisa Kato, complained about how he had been left abandoned by the government. "I am physically and mentally worn out by the nuclear crisis," he said. "They have done nothing so far to help us."The tsunami caused by Japan's magnitude 8.9 quake on Friday destroyed the commercial fishing harbor of Crescent City, California, a coastal  town still recovering from a devastating tsunami in 1964. Although most of the fishing boats were removed in advance, the 198 docking slips that the harbor had provided   for boats, enabling the livelihoods of the  fishing crews, were lost. Harbormaster Richard Young said that the harbor is destroyed. "We're facing not only physical but financial disaster," he said during a  briefing. "Our business activity came to a screeching halt yesterday, and that affects the entire community." Councilwoman Kelly Schellong said,  "This is going to have a trickle-down effect beyond the lost jobs."Crescent City's unemployment rate was 13 percent before Friday's tsunami destroyed its commerical fishing industry.  The 1964 tsunami that hit Crescent City killed 11, demolished the harbor and heavily damaged large portions of the business district. Although the city subsequently rebuilt, another tsunami again damaged the harbor in 2006. The city was in the midst of reconstructing the harbor when Friday's tsunami hit. The harbor is surrounded by land and a breakwater built after the 1964 disaster. The tsunami's huge waves entered  through a small opening provided for the entrance and exit of boats. Lori Dengler, director of the Humboldt Earthquake Education Center, says Friday's tsunami was one of as many as 38 tsunamis to strike Crescent City within the last 78 years. She calls the city a "tsunami magnet"  because of the topography of the ocean floor that contributes to its vulnerability.  She also blames the breakwater built after the 1964 tsunami because it traps  tsunami waves in the harbor, causing them to boil and churn. A county supervisor found the view painful on Saturday as she surveyed the wreckage  accompanied by state officials. She is hoping they will provide   emergency assistance. "We don't have the financial resources," she said. "We need money. That's what it takes to fix things…. Our poor little harbor."Six people have died as the result of a knife-related attack in Jersey, located within the Channel Islands. Among those killed are three children, two women and one man. The victims have remained unidentified but were all Jersey residents.In the aftermath of a multiple-stabbing scenario at Upper Midvale Road, police were informed of events at approximately 1500 BST (1400 UTC) today. At Jersey General Hospital, a man has been detained under police custody and will remain in the hospital until he recovers from surgery. A murder investigation has now been commenced. As it stands, police are not looking for any other individual in relation to the events.Speaking of behalf of States of Jersey Police, Detective Superintendent Stewart Gull explained, "This complex investigation is in its very early stages as we try to establish exactly what happened," and that the police force is aware "of the impact of any such serious and tragic incident on the local community, and we have police officers in the area to support the investigation and local people." Gull additionally said that "[d]ealing with multiple deaths of men, women and particularly young children" unsettled members of the emergency services, but they nevertheless remained "tremendously professional". Gull described Jersey as an "incredibly safe island, probably one of the safest places in the Western world," where events such as these are "extremely rare".Numerous witnesses have contacted the police in relation to the incident and are now being interviewed. Police, who are attempting to identify the dead, are currently at the scene alongside forensic investigators and detectives.A JetBlue Airbus A320 airliner, JetBlue Flight 43, made an emergency landing ahead of other scheduled flights on Sunday after being struck by lightning whilst en route between Rochester and John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) with 140 passengers on board. None of the passengers were injured in the incident.JetBlue said lightning strikes are a relatively common occurrence on commercial airliners, which are designed to cope with such events. However, a smell similar to that of an electrical fire permeated the cabin, although there was no smoke. After passengers reported the smell the pilot decided to make an emergency landing.Bryan Baldwin, a JetBlue spokesman, told reporters that the plane made an emergency landing at JFK just before 6:00 p.m. local time, meaning that passengers actually arrived at their destination twenty minutes early.A Peruvian jetliner carrying between 94 and 100 people crashed near Pucallpa, Peru on Tuesday at 21:20 UTC. Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo said 70 to 80 had been killed, and other authorities have said at least 40. The Boeing 737-200, operated by military-run airline Tans Peru had attempted an emergency landing on Federico Basadre road in Peru's central jungle.  The crash is said to have been caused by bad weather."Until now, there are 40 cadavers that rescue teams are pulling from the wreckage. There could be more deaths, we assume some 60 people in total, since we've rescued 20 injured people," said a police office in the nearby town on RPP radio.[1]The pilot contacted the Pucallpa airport saying he could not land because of strong winds and a heavy storm, said Norma Pasquel, an airport receptionist. When the plane crash-landed, its landing gear had not been released, according to firefighter Ilda Pineda.The plane was on a flight from Lima to Iquitos via Pucallpa.Five of the deaths have been confirmed by Berta Garcia, a secretary at Pucallpa's municipal hospital, on RPP radio.  She said the bodies of four adults and a small boy had been brought to the hospital.Tans Peru confirmed the emergency landing, saying several people had been killed or injured.100 people—92 passengers and eight crew members—were on the plane, said  Tans spokesman Jorge Belevan on CPN radio, and his figures were echoed by BBC News. Speaking on the same station, Transportation Minister Jose Ortiz said the plane carried 93 passengers and five crew membmers. Xinhua reported that 94 people were on the plane.A Boeing 737 jetliner operated by low-cost airline Mandala crashed approximately one minute after taking off from Polonia International Airport in the Indonesian city of Medan on the island of Sumatra. The airport is surrounded by a very densely-populated residential area.  Local TV showed images of dozens of homes and cars destroyed by the impact.Reports are still varying on the number of fatalities within the plane.  14-16 people sitting in the rear of the plane survived.  47 people on the ground and 101-103 of the 117 people aboard were killed.The Boeing 737 plane was nearly 25 years old, but was not due to be retired for another 11 years.  It received a full service in June this year.It has been reported that the flight, bound for Jakarta, was carrying several local politicians, including Rizal Nurdin, the governor of North Sumatra, and one of his predecessors.According to reports, a terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport located in New York, New York was evacuated after authorities found a suspicious package outside the main American Airlines terminal.Reports say that the package was found outside the terminal on a street curb just before 10:30 a.m. (eastern time), and turned out to be men's cologne."There was a suspicious package that was found at 10:20 a.m. curbside at Terminal 9, which is American Airlines. It turned out to be a package containing cologne," said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for American Airlines.At approximately 11:35 a.m. (eastern time) authorities began to let passengers back into the terminal, giving it the all clear.No flights were affected by the incident.The United States had raised the presence of police and bomb sniffing dogs at airports across the U.S. after a terrorist attack in Glasgow, Scotland.Jokela High School in Tuusula, Finland, scene of the Jokela school shooting, has recommenced classes. Earlier this month, student Pekka-Eric Auvinen, 18, fatally wounded eight people with his handgun before turning the weapon on himself in the country's worst ever school shooting. He died later in hospital, having never regained consciousness.All last week repair teams have been working to eradicate all traces of the event, with large numbers of bullet holes in walls and doors being filled in, broken windows and torn blinds being replaced, and total renovation of one corridor which Auvinen had attempted to set fire to.Students had previously been permitted into the school last week, in order to collect belongings left behind as they rushed to evacuate the school. On Monday, the school's 450 pupils began to attend temporary facilities set up at nearby Tuusula Primary School as well as the local church. Tuusula spokeswoman Heidi Hagman told reporters yesterday that at first school days would be considerably shortened, adding "Today the students will spend time getting used to the renovated and repaired school area. "Students and teachers are getting support from Red Cross crisis workers and psychologists during the first days of school." Esa Ukkola, head of education in Tuusula, spoke to reporters about the fact that students had been shown around the renovated school. "We need to show there is nobody lurking in the cupboards any more. We're trying to have as normal a school day as possible. There are dozens of extra people to ensure we can do everything in small enough groups."The shooting has prompted public anger in Finland at the media attention directed to it, with a feeling that it undermines the placid reputation of the country. People have questioned the decision of a survey last month to designate Finland as the world's "most livable country". Psycho-social service manager Anna Cantell-Forsbom from nearby Vantaa has spoken out about her view that the shooting was mainly caused by a lack of psychiatric care available to the Finnish youth and therefore did not reflect on Finnish society. The shooting has also prompted a move by the Finnish government to raise the legal age for gun ownership from 15 years to 18 years.Finland is expected to set up a commission of inquiry this week to investigate the murders. The government will set aside resources for the ministry of social affairs, health and education as well as the local municipality for the investigation. Meanwhile, local authorities have shown a four-year response plan to the government, asking for five million Euro to fund it. Half will go towards therapy and occupational guidance for affected residents, while the other half would go to school guidance counsellors, psychologists, school healthcare personnel and other experts. The ultimate goal of the plan is the complete recovery of those adversely affected by the shooting.Judge Justice Christopher Burns of the New York State Supreme Court has ordered a halt to an emergency demolition on a 19th century stable and livery on 428-430 Jersey Street in Buffalo, New York that partially collapsed on Wednesday June 11, initially causing at least 15 homes to be evacuated. At least two homes remain evacuated.Burns orders that both the city and the group Save The Livery (www.savethelivery.com) have to come to an agreement on what to do with the building, and try to work out ways of saving at least some portions if it including the facade, side walls and a lift tower. Save The Livery is comprised of concerned area residents who have grown to love the building's historic and unique character. On June 14, they won a temporary restraining order to stop demolition. The court ruled that the city was only allowed to remove material in immediate danger to residents and pedestrians, but stated that the demolition could only be performed with "hand tools." The court also ordered that any rubble which had fallen into neighboring yards when the building collapsed, to be removed."It is in the interest of the city to have a safe environment--but also important to maintain a sense of historical preservation," stated Burns in his ruling. Burns has given the sides until tomorrow (Friday June 20) to come to an agreement and has ordered both parties to return to court at 9:30 a.m. (eastern time) "sharp." Activists of Save The Livery urge supporters of the stable to "fill the courtroom" to show "continued and ongoing support." The hearing is scheduled to take place at 25 Delaware Avenue in the Supreme Court building, 3rd Floor, trial part 19.Currently the building is owned by Bob Freudenheim who has several building violations against him because of the buildings poor condition. He has received at least five violations in three months and residents who live near the building state that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions. Many are afraid that if the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished.On June 17, developer and CEO of Savarino Companies, Sam Savarino was at the site of the stable, discussing the building with residents and preservationists. In 2006, Savarino proposed and planned The Elmwood Village Hotel, a 'botique' hotel on the Southeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues. The project was later withdrawn after residents filed a lawsuit against Savarino and the city. Wikinews extensively covered the story, and contacted Savarino for his professional opinion on the building."[I would] love to see it preserved. I was there to see if there was anything we could do to help, to see if anything can be salvaged. I just want to see the right thing happen, and so does the city," stated Savarino to Wikinews who added that he was allowed inside the building for a brief period."The side walls are beyond repair. The roof has rotted and it could come down at any time," added Savarino who also said that the building "below the second floor appears to be stable." He also states that the back wall of the building, which borders several homes, appears to be intact."Eliminating the back wall could be a problem for the neighbors. It is not unreasonable to leave at least 12 feet" of the back wall standing, added Savarino.Savarino did not say if he was interested in buying the property, but did state, "I am sure there are  a couple of people interested" in buying the property. On Thursday, Buffalo News reported that a "businessman" might be interested in purchasing the property, though Wikinews is not able to independently confirm the report. Savarino says that with the property still slated for emergency demolition, a potential buyer could face tax fees of nearly US$300,000.Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years.The building was first owned by a company called White Bros. and was used as a stable for a farm which once covered the land around the building for several blocks. The Buffalo Fire Department believes the building was built around 1814, while the city property database states it was built in 1870. Servants and workers of the farm were housed inside resident quarters situated at the rear of the building on what is now Summer Street, but are now cottages where area residents currently reside. Some date as far back as 1829.At about 1950, the stable was converted into an automobile body shop and gasoline station.A property record search showed that in 1950 at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which New York State says is used for "below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage." The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, "excavation and backfill," but did not include "the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring." It is not known if the tanks are still on the property, but residents are concerned the city was not taking the precautions to find out.A judge at the Nova Scotia Supreme Court yesterday ruled victims of Air Canada Flight 624 can sue Transport Canada over the crash, which injured more than twenty.The action alleges Transport Canada was liable for a failure to enforce regulations under the Aeronautics Act. The authority is accused of failure to install an instrument landing system on the airport's main runway. According to Ray Wagner, lawyer for the plaintiffs, the authority's responsibility for safety gear — including navigational systems at the airport — was behind Justice Denise Boudreau's ruling certifying the class action against all defendants. Transport Canada is the airport's former owner-operator.Last year's crash saw the domestic flight from Toronto, carrying 133 passengers and five crew, hit the ground short of Runway 05 at Halifax International Airport. The jet ran 225 metres over the ground, hitting antennas, before sliding more than 500 metres along the runway. The aircraft was written off.Suing passengers allege they waited exposed in blizzard conditions for 50 minutes before being moved to a cold hangar. The airport's terminal suffered an unexpected loss of power shortly after the crash.The other defendants did not oppose yesterday's ruling certifying the case against them. They are Air Canada, the airport's authority, owner and operator of Canada's civil airspace navigation service NavCanada, and aircraft manufacturer Airbus.In April last year, days after the accident, Air Canada sent victims cheques for C$5,000 each. Wagner at the time called it "a gratuity" that "certainly doesn't cover anywhere close to the losses," saying injuries included "deep psychological injuries."In Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, the jury is deliberating in the case of Curt Dagenais, charged in the July 2006 shooting deaths of two Saskatchewan RCMP officers. Justice Gerald Allbright, in his instructions to the sequestered jury, has advised the jurors that they may consider the charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter or discharging a firearm with intent to wound or endanger life, but not the charge of first-degree murder the Crown has sought.Dagenais has entered a plea of not guilty by reason of self defense. He is charged with two counts first degree murder and one count of attempted murder in the Spiritwood Incident.Constable Michelle Knopp survived the shoot-out which erupted after a high speed chase ended about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Spiritwood, Saskatchewan near Mildred. Constables Marc Bourdages and Robin Cameron died about one week following the shoot out which occurred July 7, 2006.Defense lawyer Bill Roe argued self defense for Dagenais, saying he shot "in a blind panic" when RCMP officers fired upon him.Crown prosecutor Al Johnston asserted that Dagenais shot first. Johnston asserted that Dagenais cannot be believed, that his story is presented so he can get away with murder.The incident began with a dispute within the Dagenais family. The defendant supported his father Arthur Dagenais, and his sister supported the mother Elise Dagenais, during a divorce; his mother was to receive half the family farm from the divorce which she had previously allocated to Dagenais. Dagenais tried to speak to his mother, but the sister intervened.Dagenais reported going to the local RCMP detachment and spoke with Constable Cameron. Constable Knopp informed Dagenais that the RCMP could not be involved in a family affair.After Dagenais' sister and mother went to the police, the three constables went to charge Dagenais with assault.This is where the stories from the RCMP and Dagenais diverge. Dagenais claims that Cameron made the intial approach to arrest him and smashed his truck window, at which point Dagenais became scared and sped away from the situation. The RCMP state that Dagenais started to drive away from the situation which meant that Cameron was hit by the truck's rear view mirror. Cameron retaliated by breaking the window. Officers Cameron and Bourdages followed the departing Dagenais in a police truck; Knopp followed in a SUV. During the chase police sideswiped Dagenais' truck. The RCMP say that Dagenais was unpredictable and that he had rammed their vehicle. The RCMP tried prevent Dagenais from reaching his father's farm house fearing that there were firearms there.There is a difference in accounts of the chase and gun battle.  Dagenais claims the RCMP fired upon him first, and he fired back in self defence fearing for his life.The chase ended after RCMP rammed into the side of Dagenais' stopped truck. Because Dagenais was already stopped, according to collision reconstruction expert, there was time for Dagenais to shoot at the RCMP truck. A firearm expert studying trajectories of the bullets found that one of the rounds fired from Daganais' .30-30 Winchester entered the police vehicle at a different angle than other shots fired at the truck after the collision.Dagenais has also reported holes in his truck door.Dagenais claims when he heard the second vehicle drive up, there was more gun fire so he returned shots himself.Knopp testifed that she arrived at the scene in the second vehicle her ear was struck by a fragment from bullet fire.  She said when she arrived Daganais fired first and that Bourdages and Cameron were already badly wounded.Firearms experts established that Dagenais fired eight times, and the RCMP six times during the gunfight.During the trial evidence was presented that Dagenais had previously been assaulted by police. The RCMP had identified Daganais as a police hater. There had been previous altercations between the RCMP, Daganais and his father. Dagenais had filed prior lawsuits against the RCMP.Following the incident, Dagenias fled the scene hiding in the woods of the countryside. 200 RCMP engaged in a massive manhunt. Dagenais turned himself in July 18, 2006.The audio from the RCMP radio was submitted as evidence, and the dispatcher had opened all the channels associated with the Shellbrook area. There is no reporting of gunfire recorded on the audio.There was no videotape in the onboard video camera installed in Knopp's SUV when evidence was gathered two days following the shooting.  A photograph of three VHS tapes in Knopp's vehicle has been presented. Constable Kenneth Palen after viewing a tape, testified he was instructed not to keep the videotape found on the passenger seat of the SUV and it was destroyed in the garbage.Friday, an undersea earthquake off the far east coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula was felt in the capital city of Moscow, 10,000 kilometers away. The earthquake occurred 600km below sea level in the Okhotsk Sea and recorded an 8.2 magnitude on the Richter Scale, with the Moscow shock measured as 1.0 on the scale. No casualties or damage were reported.Citizens in Moscow said that the tremors were not "really strong" but they were enough to shake things hanging on walls. The last time such a shock was felt in Moscow was in 1984. Alexei Lyubushin, chief researcher of the Institute of Physics of the Earth at the Russian Academy of Sciences said it is common for such quakes to have large scale but low damage, "This is a so-called deep-focus earthquake, that's why it was felt at such a large territory. If an earthquake happens at such a low depth, the waves move along low layers, practically the mantle, but weaken significantly before reaching the earth surface. This is why there usually is no injuries or casualties in such cases. ... The waves can even move through the Earth's core."Sahkalin Island was under a tsunami warning on Friday, however, it was lifted soon after. The island may have to prepare for a tsunami situation again, with another under sea earthquake predicted in the next week with a magnitude of over 7.0.A kangaroo injured Australian politician Shane Rattenbury in the Australian capital, Canberra, on Thursday. Mr. Rattenbury was taking a morning jog in the Canberra suburb of Ainslie when the kangaroo surprised him, and in the ensuing confrontation, Mr. Rattenbury was scratched several times on the leg.By Mr Rattenbury's account, the kangaroo was an eastern grey kangaroo, which is a common species in Australia. Neither the kangaroo nor Mr. Rattenbury saw each other until they were close, when they both were surprised by each other. The kangaroo, which had been behind a hedge, then started hopping around and Rattenbury ducked for cover. The kangaroo bounced on him while he was still on the ground. He was left lying in the street while another pedestrian went to his assistance. He was driven home and visited a hospital, receiving a tetanus shot. He attended parliament later that day, where his colleagues made kangaroo jokes about him.Rattenbury is a member of the ACT Greens, a sitting member of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, and was an expedition leader of a Greenpeace anti-whaling expedition in 2006.There are many kangaroos living in wildlife reserves around the Australian capital, which often enter suburban areas. The attack follows previous incidents in 2009 when a kangaroo smashed inside a Canberra home, and in 2010 when a kangaroo knocked a jogger unconscious in nearby Mount Ainslie. Kangaroo culls in the Australian capital have been held annually for several years, which have drawn protests. Kangaroo management in Canberra was the subject of a television documentary in 2011 called Kangaroo Mob.25-year-old man David Striegl was knocked unconscious by a kangaroo on the Mount Ainslie nature reserve in the Australian capital Canberra on Thursday.  He received cuts and bruises and a black eye after being scratched and hit by the kangaroo. Mount Ainslie is located near the centre of the Australian capital, with Australia's parliament houses designed to be viewed from the top of the mountain.  He does not remember much about the incident, only that he turned around and saw the kangaroo which hit him in the face.  He said that the kangaroo scratched him at first then guessed that it must have hit him which caused him to lose consciousness. He was taken to hospital by a motorist who was passing by.  At the hospital he was given x-rays and a tetanus shot before being discharged.Striegl had been jogging up the mountain during his lunch break.  Joggers and cyclists are common on the mountain, which is located a few kilometres from the city centre. He was a former Australian rules footballer, and says he had never been in a fight, until being hit by the kangaroo. He had seen kangaroos box each other before but didn't know they would box people.  He said he would not have thrown a punch back if he had the chance because of their status as a national symbol, and he has no hard feelings against kangaroos. His colleagues at the United Group Ltd. real estate office where he works have given him the nickname Skippy, after the famous television show.  He said he will continue jogging at the reserve, but with company next time.Injuries from kangaroos in Australia are rare, and it is almost unheard of for someone to be knocked out by one.  This attack comes a year after a kangaroo crashed through a window of a house in Canberra before rampaging through the house.Three of fifteen escaped kangaroos are still on the loose in southern France after vandals broke open cages in an Australian-themed park, letting the kangaroos loose."When we arrived on Saturday morning, five pens had been broken open, their padlocks were smashed and the perimeter fence was torn in several places," said Carole Masson, the owner of the park which is located in Carcassonne. A massive search was organized by firefighters, police and gendarmes. So far 12 kangaroos have been found. Five of them had remained within the park.There is a concern that the marsupials will make their way onto a freeway, and become a risk to themselves or drivers.In October of 2008, in the same park, hunting dogs managed to get loose.  They later attacked and killed 44 of the park's kangaroos.Avalanches following the worst snow in two decades have killed over 100 people south of Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir, with many more still missing and remote areas still isolated. Forty-five tourists have been rescued, and the death toll is expected to rise as rescuers--including a large number of Indian troops--deal with the 4.5 metres of snow that have fallen since last Friday.The crisis has cut off electricity in Srinagar for three days and is not affecting the water supplies.  There are queues for cooking gas, and helicopters have been bringing in additional supplies.Kata Air Transport (Sudan) Antonov An-32 crashed at 19.15 GMT on approach to Chisinau International Airport in Moldova, presumably killing all eight (8) aboard. The aircraft departed the airfield for Khartoum, Sudan at approximately 1902 GMT, but the flightcrew elected to return to the airport citing faulty equipment onboard. The aircraft reportedly exploded during landing when its wing hit navigation objects located next to the runway. As of 0500 GMT today, seven of the eight bodies of those onboard had been recovered. According to the central controller’s office at the airport, the plane crew consisted of four Moldovan nationals and four citizens of Ukraine.The airplane was flying from Chisinau to Antalya and Sudan. Preliminary investigation shows the accident was caused by malfunctions in the engine. The crew decided to return to the airport soon after the takeoff due to malfunctions in the engine. The airplane crashed during the land approach. The An-32 belonged to one of Sudanese airlines and was registered in Sudan. The prosecutor’s office of Moldova has opened the criminal case. A special investigative commission has been created. The An-32 transport plane started development in 1977, and came into mass production in 1984. It is based on the An-26, one major difference being that more powerful engines allow for even flight with only one in service.  The navigating equipment onboard allows pilots to carry out flight in complex meteorological conditions, day and night. The An-32 can transport up to 42 parachuters. These planes were delivered to India and Afghanistan.Workers are scouring New Orleans for any remaining survivors of Hurricane Katrina, and are vigorously searching for dead bodies. 25,000 body bags have been prepared in advance, in the event that the death toll from Katrina is that high. Temporary warehouses are being set up around the city to deal with corpse storage.In the last twenty-four to thirty-six hours, however, officials have revised downward, at least three times, the estimated death toll; 35,000, 10,000, and now less than 10,000.  After the first sweep of the city devoted to recovery of bodies, officials retrieved approximately 800 bodies.    Floodwaters are receding, but leaving a great deal of mud and contaminated water in their wake, filled with high levels of bacteria and viruses. All survivors are urged to leave the city. Dr. Julie Gerberding, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said "If you haven't left the city yet, you must do so," and stated that anyone who comes in contact with the toxic water must immediately wash themselves with clean water. If necessary, force will be used to remove all remaining citizens from New Orleans. While Dr. Gerberding's statement about mandatory evacuation seems clear, other officials have not been as emphatic.  When asked about mandatory evacuations, New Orleans Police Superintendent Eddie Compass, while reaffirming the official word, qualified his statement stating that every reasonable means would be used to logically convince a person that it is in his best interest to evacuate.  The superintendent would not comment on whether force would be used if reason failed.  Furthermore, utility workers are in the process of re-establishing power to the Central Business District of the city prompting residents in those areas to reconsider the evacuation option.Animal rights campaigners are protesting against evidence that law enforcement officers are killing animals as a form of control. According to HelpingAnimals.com, pets left behind by evacuees are being shot.Residents of Jefferson Parish, and the upper portions of Saint Bernard Parish will be allowed to  return permanently to their homes starting on Monday. Conditions in those areas — re-establishment of power, clearing of roads, and abatement of water — have improved to the point of making permanent return possible.  Parish President Arron Broussard and Councilor Jennifer Sneed stated that residents should be allowed to return as soon as possible so repairs and rebuilding may begin.  Companies are working with the US Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide money and support to the victims of Katrina, in order to ease them into a new life.  In addition, a contract for approximately thirty-three million dollars to repair the I-10 span crossing the eastern portion of Lake Pontchartrain has been awarded. Many of the bridge sections, especially on the eastern-facing span, were knocked off their pilings as hurricane Katrina passed close to the city.  The contractor expects one span to be repaired and opened for traffic within forty-five days.Bird Flu has been found in Kazakhstan and 600 chickens died at a farm. Earlier reports suggested that a 20 year old worker from the local Nan poultry farm was taken to the hospital with a suspicious infection. He is in intensive care but he is stable and in a grave condition.Officials say that a Kenya Airways Boeing 737-800 with 8 crew members, 106 passengers and a flight engineer on board, has crashed in Cameroon. Flight KQ 507 was traveling from Abidjan to Nairobi. It made a stopover in Douala, Cameroon where more passengers got on the plane, before it continued on its flight.It is not known if there are any survivors, but Kenya Airways says that there were passengers from at least 23 different countries on the plane (list below).Reports say that 3 referees heading to an African Confederation Cup game were also on the plane along with Anthony Mitchell a British journalist who is based in Nairobi, and Amol Chauhan the director of Parle Products."Flight 507 was coming from Abidjan via Douala. The aircraft unfortunately has not arrived. The last message was received in Douala after takeoff and thereafter the tower was unable to contact the plane," CEO of Kenya Airways, Titus Naikuni said earlier in a statement.Reports say that the plane sent a distress signal at 2:00 a.m., just after it took off from Cameroon, but it is not known what triggered the distress signal. The plane was supposed to land at 6:15 a.m. local time. It left Abidjan at 11:05 p.m. local time in Nairobi."The distress call came from a machine, not a pilot. The latest information that a distress signal was picked up on the west coast of Africa and a search and rescue mission initiated by Cameroonian authorities was initiated at 1105 (0805GMT) this morning, that is Nairobi time. So far no report has been received from this mission," added Naikuni. The Cameroonian military is using helicopters to search the area around the Cameroonian capital Yaoundé, near the town of Douala, Niete and Lolodorf. Ambulances in Lolodorf are ready to treat anyone they might find during the search. The plane is believed to be in an "area [of] very dense forest," said Alfred Mutua, a spokesman for Kenya's government. The United States is also assisting in searching for the plane.Jim Proulx, a company spokesman for Boeing, said that the distress signal would have been activated "in the event of a rapid change in velocity." Proulx also expressed his sympathies saying, "we express our profound concern for the passengers and crew on board on the Kenya Airways flight that went missing."According to Kenya Airways, bad weather is causing delays in efforts to locate the plane and any possible wreckage. "We are trying to get to the area of the crash, but the weather is really bad. We are getting help from the army," said Naikuni. Nothing was found during a search of the area by air on Saturday, but rescue workers are planning to resume the search Sunday morning. Because of the bad weather and heavy rains, the search has only been concentrated in the air.Witnesses from towns near where the signal is being reported say that they heard a "large boom" and then saw a "flash of fire."According to a Kenya Airways news release, a crisis management center in Embakasi, a location close to the airport, was setup to monitor the situation and additional details will be provided when received. Relatives of those on board the plane are being asked to stay at that location and wait for further details.Despite the search, the TurkishPress.com, which quotes AFP, an unnamed official says that they have located the wreckage."The plane has crashed. We have located the plane ... and we cannot talk about it," said the unnamed official with the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority. Despite the AFP's report, Naikuni says he cannot confirm that the plane has crashed or if anything was found. "Until we see the plane -- until then, it's missing." Naikuni also added that the distress signal could have been triggered by something other than a crash.The last Kenya Airways flight to crash was on January 30, 2000.  Flight 431 was traveling from Abidjan to Lagos when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean during bad weather. 179 people were on board and 10 survived.A helicopter crash at the edge of Nairobi, Kenya has killed six. Amongst the dead is internal security minister George Saitoti, a candidate in next year's presidential election.Saitoti, 66, played a major role in Kenya opting to send troops into Somalia last year in a bid to combat al-Shabaab. His deputy Joshua Orwa Ojonde is also dead, alongside both pilots and two bodyguards. The aircraft had not long departed Wilson Airport when it went down into a Kibuku District forest. One witness saw the helicopter "flying very low. It came down suddenly and we heard a loud explosion, and then it burst into flames." Another said it "hovered up there and looked like it was turning back" before crashing. The accident occurred at around 8:30 this morning, local time.Current President Mwai Kibaki decried "a devastating loss to our country." He called Saitoti "a hardworking and determined public servant who dedicated his time to the service of the Kenyan people". Prime Minister Raila Odinga, speaking at the scene, promised "a thorough probe" into the accident. He described a "great tragedy that has befallen our country".Saitoti, who personally told the public of the invasion of Somalia two days after sending in thousands of soldiers, had been faced with numerous bombings and kidnaps. He routinely made assurances on national TV in the aftermath of attacks, and recently vowed "terrorists" would not have an impact on government.With qualifications in accountancy and mathematics acquired in the US, Saitoti was a former Kenyan finance minister. A prominent figure in national politics, he also served as vice president under Daniel Arap Moi in 1989–1997 and 1999–2002.There is no immediate word on possible causes for the accident. Police have sealed off the scene and begun an investigation.The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a warning to 3,747 laboratories in the United States and 17 other countries around the world, instructing them to destroy samples of the deadly H2N2 Asian influenza virus that was mistakenly sent to them last fall by the College of American Pathologists, US company Meridian Bioscience and several other organizations responsible for testing laboratory proficiency worldwide, as soon as possible.The H2N2 flu strain killed between 1 million and 4 million people in 1957 and is thought to have become extinct in the wild in 1968. The WHO stated that the virus strain should never have been circulated, because of the risk that it could cause a pandemic among people born after 1968, who would probably have little or no immunity to it, as the strain is not contained in current flu vaccines.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is operating under the presumption that the H2N2 strain was purposefully dispatched. Officials of both organizations have assigned a low but real risk to the possibility of an outbreak. No-one has actually become infected.According to WHO, the virus was sent to laboratories in Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Meridian executives were unavailable for comment.Authorities were on high alert as a KLM Cityhopper flight from London made an emergency landing at Eindhoven Airport. The plane was forced to land with broken landing gear. During the landing, two tires broke and the plane was violently shaken. Four crew and 50 passengers were on board at the time.During the emergency, the airport was immediately closed and emergency crews arrived within minutes at the scene. Twenty fire units were sent to the plane.The Ministry of Defense said no one was injured in the incident and an investigation is under way.Kobe, Japan — January 17, 2005.Several commemoration ceremonies were recently held for victims of the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995, mainly in Kansai region. The municipality of Kobe and supporting organisations held one such ceremony in the early morning of January 17.  It was the biggest ceremony held that day. Over 5,000 people gathered in the East Playground in the center of city. Participants included surviving citizens and volunteers from around the whole country who had helped out.  At 5:43 a.m., just 10 years after the earthquake first occurred, people lit candles in honor of the 6,433 victims.  The victims included 133 people who died in the aftermath of the disaster, due to physical or mental difficulties caused by the heavy changes in their life. The earthquake centered around Awaji Island, near the city of Kobe. It measured 7.3 on the Richter Scale, the biggest quake to hit Japan since World War II. Though a great earthquake could theoretically occur in any part of Japan, and scientists had warned of the possibility of earthquakes in the Kansai region, citizens and local government tended to be unaware of this possibility 10 years ago.  The death and destruction caused by the quake gave a serious shock to the city's residents.  One story of the Kobe city hall was totally destroyed, and a part of Meishin Highway between Nagoya and Kobe was ripped apart; a bus barely avoided falling from the broken highway.  Engineers buttressed vulnerable city structures throughout Japan after the earthquake. Research revealed that architecture designed under national earthquake-proof standards had survived the earthquake. Many old buildings were rebuilt, reconstructed, or given structual support. Vulnerable city infrastructure was also attended to; in some areas water and fuel supply had been disrupted for over two months. Many municipalities reviewed their standards for civil engineering design.The earthquake also revealed systematic vulnerability within the Japanese government. The prime minister at that time, Tomiichi Murayama, first learned of the earthquake from a TV news program two hours later, and not from a government report.  He called his secretary, who also knew nothing of it.  The government improved these weaknesses, and in the case of the Chuetsu Earthquake in October 2004, the prime minister's office was able to quickly deal with the accident.After the earthquake, many people spent days in shelters. 104,900 houses were completely destroyed, and 144,256 only partly desroyed. The Hyogo prefecture and municipalities provided temporary shelters, called Kasetsujutaku. Such temporary houses had remained since 2000. Since those houses were provided to individuals and not to communities, many people found they were no longer with their familiar neighbors after moving. This caused serious problems among people, especially the elderly. Since 2000, around 200 people have died alone in such temporary houses, to be found only days later; this was considered a serious social problem.  A word was even coined for this situation, Kodokushi (meaning "death in solitude" in Japanese), but some say no effective solution has yet been offered. The earthquake has also had a bright side. Before the earthquake, it was not popular to participate voluntarily in social activities in Japan. The earthquake moved many people to join such activities. Since it was close to the end of the Japanese schoolyear, many students could stay in the affected area for long days. And it has been not easy to have a vacation for Japanese workers, as many people took vacations from their company and went to the affected area to help out.  This was not just a temporary movement, but influenced people to consider such social engagement as a regular activity (one can see a similar  influcence in the case of the Chuetsu Earthquake).On Sunday, the country of Kuwait pledged US$500 million in oil products and other aid to United States Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. It is the single largest donation given to help the victims of hurricane Katrina. Energy Minister Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah explained, "The humanitarian aid is oil products that the devastated (U.S.) states need in these circumstances, plus other humanitarian aid to lessen the devastation these three states have been subjected to."Al Sabah also stated that "It's our duty as Kuwaitis to stand by our friends to lighten the humanitarian misery and as a payback for the many situations during which Washington helped us through the significant relations between the two friendly countries." Kuwait is in fact one of the U.S.'s strongest allies in the Middle East, due to the U.S. protection of Kuwait in 1991 during the Gulf War.Kuwait's donation was followed by a $100 million donation from Qatar, a small, U.S. friendly peninsula jutting out into the Red Sea. These donations were brought on as the 22 members of Arab League (based in Egypt) asked Arab countries to donate to the Katrina relief efforts, and sent their deepest condolences to the U.S.File:12306354.jpgA court in Kuwait yesterday sentenced fifteen people for involvement in June's bombing of the Imam Sadiq Mosque. Seven were sentenced to death.The suicide attack in Kuwait City killed 26 and injured 227. The trial of seven women and 22 men before Judge Mohammad al-Duaij produced fourteen acquittals. All those sentenced to death were men; prison terms from two to fifteen years were imposed on the remaining convicts. A number were tried in absentia.Sunni militants Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack. IS view Shi'ites as enemies. Conducted in the Shi'ite mosque during Friday prayers, the attack came during Ramadan. IS hold a large swathe of Iraq and Syria. Sunnis and Shi'ites live together peacefully in Kuwait. It was amongst the worst attacks to hit the nation in decades.The accused include Kuwaiti, Saudi, and Pakistani citizens, as well as stateless individuals. Abdul Rahman Sabah Saud, stateless, admitted driving bomber Fahad Suleiman Abdulmohsen al-Gabbaa, Saudi, to the mosque. Saud, also accused of handling explosives, denied intending to harm any people. Judge al-Duaij found Fahad Farraj Muhareb to be an IS leader and sentenced him to death. Muhareb and Saud are in Kuwaiti custody. Saudi brothers Mohammad and Majed al-Zahrani, who have been detained in their homeland but were tried in absentia, were held to have transported the explosives used out of Saudi Arabia. Two stateless men convicted of being IS soldiers and a man whose identity is unclear were also sentenced to death in their absence.Of the eight given prison terms, three were men and five women. They were convicted of offences such as assisting the attack, training IS fighters, and withholding knowledge about the bombing. The death row convicts faced more serious charges such as premeditated murder. Appeals are possible. The prosecution had sought death sentences for eleven defendents.Amnesty International acknowledged the bombing was "an utterly heinous and callous criminal act" but said the death sentences are "misguided" and "must be overturned". The group, which is categorically opposed to the death penalty, said Kuwait conducted five executions in 2013 and none at all last year. Judge al-Duaij said in delivering his judgement "The court draws attention to the dangers of this extremist ideology that resorts to terrorism for its implementation."An explosion and subsequent chemical fire at the Australian National University this afternoon caused an estimated AU$1 million in damage and forced the evacuation of most of the  main campus.The initial explosion occurred on the top floor of the Research School of Chemistry in the early afternoon, and caused a fire which quickly spread throughout the rest of the floor. While no one was injured, the Brisbane Courier-Mail is reporting "widespread damage" to the laboratories. Furthermore, a number of computers containing postgraduate student theses were destroyed, causing the loss of months of work.As the fire spread a cloud of potentially toxic smoke formed. A large number of fire personnel were called to the site and police, with limited success, attempted to cordon off access to the university. Buildings downwind were progressively evacuated, including the central union building and students association at approximately 3pm. Students in the buildings were asked to leave the campus entirely. There was a great deal of confusion afterwards. Police were able to clear the buildings successfully, but had some difficulty evacuating those who were already outside. The university sent an email message giving a brief explanation of the situation at around the same time, but this did not reach most students immediately, leading to widespread confusion as to what exactly was going on.Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Lawrence Cram sent an follow-up email to the students at approximately 3.30 p.m. stating that the fire was under control and suggesting that the students in the affected areas should go home. There were reports of activities being cancelled at the other end of the campus late into the afternoon.While the remainder of the university will reopen Saturday, it is not currently known when the Research School will reopen, or just how severely the fire will affect ongoing academic programs at the university.A lahar at New Zealand's Mount Ruapehu is all but over, without causing anywhere the level of havoc for which authorities were prepared.The event was first confirmed by a 3 News helicopter, and then the Department of Conservation.The Department of Conservation had said that a "moderate lahar" was moving down the side of Mount Ruapehu.The lahar travelled down the Whangaehu Valley, past the Tongariro catchment; and then continued on to the Tangiwai Bridge, the site of the 1953 Tangiwai disaster, which was itself caused by a lahar.The crater lake is currently being reported by a free phone number as at a warning level of 3a. The crater lake is also being reported at a level between 5.7-6.7 metres up the Crater Lake tephra dam.The lahar emergency plan was activated by Civil Defence. The district mayor of Ruapehu, Sue Morris, and conservation minister, Chris Carter, said that the authorities had been very quick to respond to the emergency. All three electronic surveillance technologies had their alarms activated. Mr Carter said, "The lahar travelled down the path as predicted, and the early warning response system that this government provided worked exactly as planned."Highways near Mount Ruapehu were closed by the Ohakune police, including the Desert Road. The roads have now been re-opened.A lahar has been expected for a long time now, and scientists say the lahar could have been caused by, among other things, the bad weather New Zealand has been having lately.Since 1996 the water level in the crater lake at the top of Mount Ruapehu has been rising, which created a risk of a lahar last year.Suspected Maoist guerrillas killed eight Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans in Chattisgarh, India yesterday, blowing up a bullet-proof police patrol in the Bijapur district of the state. It was the first major attack by Maoists in the area since 76 people were killed in an ambush incident at Dantewada.The naxalites detonated an improvised explosive device near Pedakodepal village, located on National Highway 16 in Bijapur, then opened fire at security men, confirmed by the Director General of Police of Chattisgarh. The driver of the vehicle was also killed in the incident. One jawan was severely wounded and another missing, he added. The injured are being treated in a Jagdalpur hospital."It appears that the security personnel ignored the instruction not to travel in any kind of vehicle in the naxal-infested areas," Home Minister of Chattisgarh Nankiram Kanwar said. "The Maoists appear to be working with a better intelligence network and the forces need to be more alert."At least nine people have died in northern Italy after a landslide caused the derailment of a passenger train. A further 25 people were injured, according to emergency services.The incident occurred earlier this morning near the border with Austria, in a mountainous region near Merano, a city around 300 kilometres north of Venice."There are nine confirmed victims, while 28 people have been injured, seven of them seriously," reported the governor of the Bolzano-Bozen province, Luis Durnwalder, to the Reuters news service. Initially, eleven people were reported dead, due to what the governor described as a "counting error". However, he noted that "there could still be someone buried in the mud", so the death count is not yet final.According to the ANSA news agency, the train had about forty passengers on board when it derailed. Sky TV, meanwhile, quoted officials as saying that three people are reported to be missing. The authorities say the landslide was due to a broken irrigation pipe, which caused rocks to fall onto the tracks below. Authorities say they are looking into why the pipe burst.The trains front car hit two trees upon derailment, local media says, which prevented it from dropping off into a river below. The carriage, however, was hanging over the river, and firefighters had to use cables to stop it from falling any more. A crane was also dispatched the scene to help clean up debris, ANSA reported."The train is hanging off the rails about five meters from the river. It is now only a few trees that are holding up the train and preventing it falling into the river," said a witness, Alex Rowbotham, to the BBC."[...] The landslide occurred at the very passage of the train. It hit the train," said Thomas Widmann, a transport official for the city of Bolanzo.The crash was the deadliest in Europe since February, when eighteen people died after two commuter trains ran into each other near Brussels, Belgium. Italy saw its worse rail crash two decades ago, when 29 people died following the derailment of a freight train carrying petroleum gas, resulting in several explosions.On Saturday night, in Taining distrinct, Fujian Province, China, a landslide of about 100,000 cubic metres hit a construction site for a hydraulic power station.  Initial reports said 34 people were missing, but over the following hours local authorities increased this figure to 41 people missing.This event occurred after heavy rains recorded the previous day in that area.  The country's president, Xi Jinping, asked local authorities to increase their efforts to establish the whereabouts of missing persons.This slippage also reportedly injured seven people. Xinhua also said the rescue effort and search for possible survivors has involved more than 400 rescuers. Released images of this landslide show various structural remains — walls, roofs, etc. — embedded in muddy earth at a riverbank.Last December in Shenzhen City, a landslide buried 77 people. The government indicated at the time the disaster was due to safety regulation violations.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude 7.2 has struck  the Xinjiang region of China. The Earthquake Administration of China has reported the quake to be a 7.3 magnitude.The quake struck at 6:33 a.m. (local time) and its epicenter was located 228 kilometers (142 miles) southeast of Hotan and 780 k.m. (485 miles) east, northeast of Islamabad, Pakistan. The depth was recorded at 37.2 k.m. (23.1 miles).According to USGS geophysicist Dale Grant, this is the largest quake on record to hit the region. The largest quake on record occurred in China in 1556 in Shaanxi and had a magnitude of at least 8.0, killing over 830,000 people.Aftershocks with magnitudes of 5.5 and under began to occur just over an hour later in the same region.As of 2006, the reported population of Hotan was 114,000. The region is sparsely populated and so far there are reports of only some damage, but no injuries or deaths. However, the USGS states that damage could be "moderate to heavy." The quake struck near the Tarim Basin which is home to about 1/3 of China's oil reserve supply.Saskatoon, Saskatchewan —A 600 lb bomb which was found in Northern Ireland has been defused by a bomb disposal team. The bomb was found on the side of a road near the village of Forkhill in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, close to the border with the Republic of Ireland. It was defused by an expert bomb disposal team from the Irish Army. The explosives were home-made and weighed 600 lb (270 kg). It is believed that the bomb was planted there by dissident republicans.The Police Service of Northern Ireland believed that there could have been a "devastating outcome" — and that they were also potentially targets of the bombers.  Chief Inspector Sam Cordner said: "The actions of terrorist criminals in planting this device in the Forkhill area put local people and police officers at significant risk." "Their actions were reckless and dangerous in the extreme. Their target may have been the police, but they did not care who they killed or injured. It is only through the hard work and professionalism of police officers and their military colleagues that the area has been made safe," Cordner said.20 people had to evacuate their homes while the bomb was safely defused. Authorities took the device and will conduct a forensic examination.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 7.92 earthquake has struck eastern Sichuan Province in China. The USGS first reported the quake to be a magnitude 7.8 which hit at 6:28:00 UTC. Officials say that at least 10,000 may have been killed and local reports indicate over 10,000 injured.At least 107 people, some of them school children, were killed when two schools collapsed. It is reported that 900 students remain trapped in the rubble. Two people were killed after a water tower fell over. According to the USGS, damage is expected to be "very heavy" and that "some reports of damage have been received. Felt widely throughout China." Officials now fear landslides and mudslides."The epicenter of today's quake was shallow, which means it released more destructive energy. We have to guard against mudslides and collapsing buildings," said China Seismology Bureau scientist, Zhang Guomin.The quake's epicenter was located in the Aba prefecture, 90 kilometers (55 miles) west, northwest of Chengdu, Sichuan, China and was recorded at a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles). At least 11,000 people reside in the area, and because of poor communications due to the quake, the total extent of the damage is not known.Several counties have been hit hard, including Beichuan, in which 80% of the buildings have been reported to have collapsed. Deaths from this area have not been accurately accounted for yet. In another county, already 3,000-5,000 are reported to have died, with a further 10,000 injured.The quake could be felt as far away as Bangkok, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Shanghai and Beijing. At least 13 large aftershocks with a magnitude ranging from 4.9 to 6.0 have been recorded.This is the largest earthquake to strike the region in almost 60 years. The deadliest quake in China's history was of magnitude 7.8, striking Tangshan in 1976. Approximately 250,000 people were killed.On Tuesday, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 has struck the area surrounding Arequipa, Peru, killing one person and injuring several more. According to local authorities, the victim was a 93-year-old man who died when a wall from his house collapsed and crushed him.The epicentre of the quake was 60 km away from Arequipa, and over 700 km away from the country's capital, Lima.In addition to the injuries, damage to roads and property was also reported.Approximately one year ago, a larger earthquake struck Southern Peru. It had a magnitude of 8.0 and it resulted in over 2000 injuries, more than 500 of which resulted in fatalities.Japan has issued a tsunami warning after experiencing a magnitude 7.1 earthquake off the west coast island of Honshu. The US Geological Survey reported a magnitude 6.7 earthquake on March 25, 2007 at 9:41 a.m. local time near the west coast of Honshu and a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in the Southern Pacific off Vanuatu at 11:40 a.m. local time. The tremor did not trigger a tsunami.The USGS has reported subsequent smaller tremors in the regions of Honshu, on March 25, 2007 at 6:11 p.m. local time and Vanuatu, at 9:37 p.m., with magnitudes of 5.5 and 5.2, respectively.Japan's Meteorological Agency lifted the tsunami advisory for Ishikawa prefecture at 11:30 a.m. JST.ABC news says that 21 people died in the quake. The death occurred after a woman was struck, reportedly, by a stone lantern in her garden. NHK also states that South Korea's meteorological agency broadcast a tsunami advisory for the eastern and southeastern coast areas. A 50 cm tsunami was expected to reach the Busan area at 12:02 pm local time.NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata prefecture was operating normally. Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reported no effects from the earthquake and that the Number 1 and 2 reactors at its Shika nuclear power plant were shut down. It is reported that some 9400 homes in the region are without water and approximately 100 without electricity. Some roads have been damaged, railway service interrupted in the affected areas, and the Noto Airport in Ishikawa prefecture remains closed. The Japanese government has set up a task force at the risk management center in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official residence. It is collecting information to confirm damage.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a large magnitude 6.4 quake has struck Indonesia, the seventh such major earthquake in two days. The Meteorology Agency of Indonesia recorded the quake at a magnitude 6.9.The epicenter was located 164 kilometers (102 miles) west, southwest of Bengkulu, Sumatra, Indonesia with a depth of 47 km (29.2 miles), and the Meteorology Agency recorded it at a depth of only 10 km (6.2 miles).The Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning for the west coast of Sumatra, but was called off a short time later. The USGS did not believe a tsunami will occur saying "the earthquake is not big enough" and that they "generally need to be over 7.2" to generate one.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had issued a bulletin stating that "no widespread destructive tsunami is expected based on historical earthquake data," but that there could be "local tsunamis" located "not more than 100 k.m." from the quake's epicenter.There is no word on any injuries, deaths or damage. The region has been almost continuously rattled by earthquakes and aftershocks since a major magnitude 8.4 quake struck the region on September 12 killing at least 13 people and injuring hundreds. Several towns report that most of their buildings have been destroyed.Volcanologists say that the domino effect of the quakes could make some volcanoes in the region active. "We expect a triggering effect on volcanoes in the region which have already shown some activities in the last couple of years," said a Department of Earth Sciences Professor in Indonesia.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 has struck Greece. The epicenter was recorded 20 miles away from the city of Patras, and 125 miles away from Athens, the Greek capital. The earthquake occurred soon after 12:00 UTC today, according to the Athens Geodynamic Institute. The USGS originally reported the quake as a magnitude 6.5.There have been reports of at least two people killed and 37 injured. There has also been damage to property and mobile phone networks which are being overloaded. There are also reports of families trapped inside the rubble of homes and businesses.The control tower at Andravida airport is reported to have sustained serious damage and has been abandoned. Many buildings and homes are said to be severely damaged or collapsed.The tremors from the earthquake were noticeable in large parts of Greece, including Athens, but the shaking could be felt as far away as Italy.A nationwide mobilisation of civil defence and fire brigade units commenced after the natural disaster.  Finally, schools were also ordered closed on Monday in the affected areas.An eathquake with a magnitude of 5.2 has struck at the coast just north of French Guiana. The earthquake struck 770 miles North East of Cayenne, the capital of French Guiana.The earthquake occurred on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is a continental ridge that stretches through much of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans.The earthquake, which struck 1050 miles away from Belem in Brazil, occurred at 23:29:52 UTC yesterday.The United States Geological Survey (USGS) initially reported a magnitude 6.2 earthquake, later downgraded to 5.9, has struck the nation of Georgia. Georgia's meteorology center says the quake registered an 8.0. A magnitude 5.0 aftershock struck just minutes later.The initial quake occurred at 3:41 a.m. (local time) and was centered 80 kilometers (50 miles) Northeast of Kutaisi, Georgia. It registered at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles). The aftershock was centered in roughly the same location and depth and struck minutes later at 3:49 a.m.Power temporarily went out in many parts of Tskhinvali, but returned a short time later. According to the USGS, damage from the initial could have been "moderate to heavy," though no major damage was reported. Fallen rocks were reported to have blocked some roads, and some homes sustained minor damage to ceilings and walls. At least 10,000 people live within miles of the epicenter. No one was injured.At 19:29:46 UTC (2:29:46 local time), an earthquake estimated by the United States Geological Survey at a magnitude of 6.8 struck just off the Pacific coast of Guatemala, approximately 115 km (70 miles) south-southwest of Guatemala City. The USGS estimates the depth at 64.8 km (40.3 miles)."It has not caused any damage, there is no damage reported," said emergency services spokesman for Guatemala's emergency response team, Benedicto Giron.Despite the claims of no damage, the swaying of buildings, damages to houses, collapsing buildings and mudslides are being reported in Guatemala. Buildings also swayed in El Salvador. There are no reports of injures or deaths, but the USGS reports that damage in the area could be moderate to heavy."[There are] no reports of damage or casualties at this time; however, this earthquake may have caused damage due to its location and size," said a statement posted on the USGS website.A Red Cross spokesman in El Salvador, Carlos Lopez says that there are no reports of damage or injuries in El Salvador. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a bulletin stating that there was little risk of a tsunami; the bulletin listed the magnitude of the earthquake at 7.0."The earthquake was too deep to generate a tsunami hazard. We don't think there is going to be a dangerous Pacific-wide tsunami but we will monitor the situation," said spokesman for the NOAA Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, David Walsh.On June 8, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck off the coast of Guatemala in the same region 100 km (60 miles) south-southwest of Guatemala City.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a major magnitude 7.3 earthquake has struck 131 kilometers (82 miles) southwest of Macquarie Island, an Australian holding located to the south of New Zealand.The quake struck at 11:30 a.m. local time and had a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) states that there is no threat of a large tsunami, but that small local waves may be generated close to the quake's epicenter.The NOAA further said that, "Authorities can assume the danger has passed if no tsunami waves are observed near the epicenter within an hour of the earthquake."So far, there is no word on injuries or damage.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a magnitude 6.7 earthquake has been reported in the Solomon Islands.The epicenter was located 73 kilometers (45 miles) west, southwest of Honiara, in the Solomon Islands. The depth was recorded at 1.8 km (1.1 miles).The USGS says that damage could be light to moderate.The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says that no large or widespread tsunami is expected based on historical data.A large explosion, now confirmed to have been a bomb, shook Ankara, Turkey, killing at least 6 people and injuring at least 80. The explosion happened in the middle of a shopping district in the Turkish capital during the rush hour, while many people were out shopping.At first, the explosion was believed to be an accident, but officials later explained that it may have been caused by a bomb, either triggered by a remote-controlled device or a suicide bomber. There was widespread damage to the area; several buildings had their windows blown out."This is the most horrific scene I have ever seen. It gives me great grief," Mayor Melih Gokcek said."We have seen a vicious, ruthless terror attack at Ankara's busiest time," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told reporters. "Is it a suicide bomber or a parcel bomb? Technical teams are working on this."A huge fire was reported in Hackney Wick eastern London, England, on part of the 2012 Olympic Games site scheduled to be the location of the handball courts.Flames are visible from Canary Wharf and the smoke plume is visible across the whole of the City of London. The fire, at a disused single-storey warehouse in Waterden Road, Stratford, is said to have been reported around 12:05 GMT. The Associated Press reports say that a "large explosion" preceded the fire; eyewitnesses do not confirm this, though there is flammable material on the site.  David Jones of East London Bus company states that the fire started at a disused warehouse adjacent to their Waterden Road depot.Eight fire appliances and 40 fire-fighters were initially deployed. The winds carried the smoke over London and reports suggested that the plume of smoke was visible from Rochester, Kent.By 13:15 GMT the London Fire Brigade reported that there were 15 appliances and around 75 firefighters, and the fire was not yet under control.Police say they have no evidence of a terrorist attack at this time.Charles Buchanan of London City Airport told BBC News that the airport was still operational but had closed one runway whose flight path crosses the smoke plume, though services are unaffected.  A short stretch of railway close to Hackney Wick was temporarily closed but suffered no damage.London Ambulance Service confirms that there are no known casualties and their emergency response team has been stood down, though their hazardous area team remains on site. Police are holding back large crowds of bystanders.At least 114 people have been killed by fires in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. According to local fire official Nazrul Islam, the fire started in an apartment complex when an electrical transformer exploded. The fire that started at about 20:45 local time on Thursday then spread to six or seven other buildings in the densely populated Najiranazar neighbourhood of old Dhaka.The fire was brought under control after three hours of effort on Friday morning, leaving at least 114 dead and a further 40 injured of which 10 to 12 are in critical condition. The current casualties follows the death of 25 in a previous fire on Tuesday.Witnesses said that fueling the flames were chemicals from illegal home-based factories in the Kayettuli neighborhood. Kayettuli is one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in Dhaka.A large forest fire that started on Monday, June 9 is still out of control in the municipality of Froland in southern Norway. The fire is the largest forest fire to occur in Norway since World War II.The fire has spread extensively and it is estimated that approximately 2,500 acres of forest have been damaged. Approximately 15 cabins are reported to have burned to the ground, but as of yet, no permanent dwellings or farms have been damaged. However, many inhabitants have been evacuated due to the fire threatening their homes, including the entire villages of Mykland and Belland. There have also been some power outages due to power lines being damaged.Approximately 140 persons, including fire-fighters from several fire departments, and personnel from the Civil Defence and the Home Guard are working to curtail the fire. Four fire helicopters have been deployed. The fire fighting is focused on areas where the fire threatens buildings.Extremely dry weather, and difficult wind conditions, have caused severe difficulties in fighting the fire. Fire-fighters first had hope of gaining control on the morning of Thursday, June 12, but the wind changed direction during the day, causing a large extension of the fire. There is some hope that the weekend will bring some rain; however, this will likely not be enough to stop the fire. It could take several weeks before the fire is completely extinguished.According to live scanner communications, fire officials say a large gas main has exploded in a neighborhood located in San Bruno, California. Earlier scanner communications had suggested a "large commercial aircraft" had crashed."This is a natural gas explosion with multiple structures and vehicles," said one firefighter to San Mateo County dispatch while on the scene. "[at least] 20 structures are involved," said another firefighter with about 10-20 acres of land involved in the blaze. Later estimates put at least 30 to 35 structures involved in the fire.According to communications, fire departments from six different companies are reporting to the scene. Power has been shut off to the area while efforts are made to bring the blaze under control. PG&E says the line affected by the explosion is a 24 inch natural gas line.By 11:00pm PST yesterday, KPIX-TV was reporting three dead and 53 structures destroyed. On Friday, officials raised the death toll to 6 with several others injured and some still missing. Earlier reports were that several people are said to be trapped in a home near the site of the explosion. The location of the incident is just outside of San Francisco International Airport.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the Vanuatu region in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday. The quake was followed by a large aftershock with a magnitude of 7.3.So far there are no reports of damage or injuries.Both of the quakes' epicenters were centered roughly 373 kilometres northwest of the Vanuatu city of Santu, at a depth of 33 kilometres.Vanuatu was placed under a tsunami warning after the earthquake started, however, it has since been removed, as the tremors managed to produce only small waves.The earthquake comes a week after another heavy tremor caused tsunamis in the South Pacific. That quake killed 170 people on the islands of Tonga, Samoa, and American Samoa.The remains of the last missing person following the bridge collapse in Minneapolis were recovered on Monday. The official death toll now stands at 13, following the collapse nearly three weeks ago. All recovery efforts have now been stopped.The remains of Gregory Jolstad were found yesterday. Jolstad, nicknamed "Jolly," was a member of the construction crew that was resurfacing the bridge. Jolstad was driving a skid loader. He was 45.Jolstad's wife, Lisa Jolstad, was worried that the search for her husband's remains would drag on, leaving her without any closure. Sheriff Rich Stanek said, "There aren't a lot of smiles here tonight...We all have very heavy hearts. It weighed on a lot of people, both personally and professionally."Governor Tim Pawlenty asked President Bush on Monday to declare the collapse a major disaster, allowing the state to be eligible for more federal money. President Bush is scheduled to be in Minneapolis today to get a briefing on the bridge.A launch failure occurred at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on Tuesday.The failure occurred when Orbital Sciences Corporation's Antares rocket, which was carrying the Cygnus vehicle with cargo of 5,000 pounds (about 2,300 kg), exploded after liftoff at 6:22 p.m. local time (2222 UTC), creating a massive fireball in the sky. Nobody was reported injured during the explosion, but the rocket was destroyed. The cargo was supplies for the International Space Station (ISS). Despite the explosion, the astronauts working on the ISS will not run out of food or supplies, according to a NASA statement released on Tuesday.Orbital's vice president Frank Culbertson said the contractor's spacecraft will not fly until the cause of the failure is determined. NASA plans to continue the mission of delivering supplies to astronauts once it fully understands how this happened.The rocket was to launch on Monday night, but a boat entered the hazard area, delaying the launch until the following night.The cause of the explosion is under investigation by NASA and Orbital Sciences. NASA said the National Transportation Safety Board is monitoring the investigation.Scientists warn that Mount Merapi, or "The Mountain of Fire," a large Indonesian volcano on the island of Java is likely to erupt. Molten lava and shallow volcanic earthquakes were recorded on Wednesday, as well as further tremors on Thursday morning.Mount Merapi is the most active of 130 volcanoes in Indonesia. It is a strato-volcano with an active summit lava dome. It has small eruptions every 3-4 years and larger eruptions every 10-15 years. It has produced more pyroclastic flows, popularly known as heat cloud and magma, than any other volcano in the world. The last fatal eruption happened in 1994, killing 60. During the eruption in 1930, 1,300 people died. Historians say that Mount Merapi has been erupting for 10,000 years.Mount Merapi is considered very sacred by the locals. According to the local folk-lore the volcano's eruption is the result of spirits being angered by not receiving sufficient offerings or by a disrespectful attitude among the people in slopes. 27,000 locals in 3 villages could be affected by this eruption. Scientists gave a warning of eruption a fortnight back and asked for immediate evacuation. The nearest city is Yogyakarta. The awesome sight of the erupting volcano has attracted many tourists and locals.Leaked emails have revealed that the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF) were aware of a dangerous problem with fuel leaking from Nimrod MR2 surveillance aircraft long before one exploded in midair during a mission in Kandahar, Afghanistan. All 14 people on board were killed in the crash in September last year. Graham Knight, father of Sergeant Ben Knight, who died in the accident aged 25, told reporters that he had received internal RAF emails detailing prior concerns about the fuel leak problems on the Nimrod. One email originally sent on December 2, 2005 commented that “XV230 [the tail number of the Nimrod that would go on to crash] has fuel-leak issues which need to be rectified before the aircraft can be deployed.” Another, from February 2006, had the following to say: “The age of the airframe, combined with the aggressive tempo with which we are flying the jets in stark temperature shifts, is contributing to our leak headache.” Another email later the same month highlighted the serious nature of the problem: “Fuel leaks on the Nimrod MR2 aircraft now pose a significant threat to the force being able to meet commitments and operational tasking.” The emails were quietly forwarded to Knight, who has gone public with them via Sky News. “I have evidence that a fuel leak caused the crash and the Service was fully aware of the risk months beforehand. I believe the RAF killed my son,” he said.He said that the emails were all written by senior members of the RAF, adding “there are so many people within the organisation who are not happy with what has been going on.”"The more I have dug, the deeper the conspiracy gets - essentially, I think the major failures have been down to communication problems."A board of inquiry has recently completed deliberating the cause of the accident, with a final report expected in about two weeks time. It is expected by many that the report will find a fuel leak was to blame. The crash was the largest loss of life from any UK service in a single incident since the Falklands war. Although the report will determine the cause of the crash and make recommendations to prevent it's recurrence, it will not attempt to establish blame for the disaster.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had previously admitted they were experiencing Nimrod fuel leaks, saying in January that in the six months proceeding there had been no less than 25 fuel leaks in RAF Nimrod aircraft. Nimrods were grounded after the crash, but were subsequently phased back into operation, and are currently back in full service flying regular reconnaissance missions in Afghanistan.The MoD's response to these recent allegations was as follows: "RAF Nimrod aircraft are designed and certified to strict airworthiness and safety standards. "If we didn't have confidence in the aircraft, we would not continue to fly them. "Nimrod has a good safety record and remains a potent and respected aircraft. "The Board of Inquiry to establish the cause of the accident last September is continuing and it would be unhelpful to speculate on the outcome until the board's findings are published."All 12 of the crewmembers on board were from 102 Squadron at RAF Kinloss, Scotland. The loss was so large as in to have an adverse affect on the air base. The other two personnel on board were a marine and a solider."An aircraft should not suddenly burst into a ball of flames in mid-air,” Knight commented. He has been conducting his own investigation based on documentation obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. One important document is a recommendation made by BAE Systems in 2004 following a safety audit that concluded that it would be impossible to extinguish a fire on a Nimrod. The recommendation was to install a fire detection system. It was never acted upon.NASA has reported that a sensor aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis recorded a force of 1G on the shuttle's left wing. This could have been a small impact caused by a meteorite or space junk, or a sensor glitch. The anomaly was recorded on reinforced carbon panels 7 and 8 and reported during a mission briefing on Tuesday afternoon by NASA."[Sensors recorded a] 1G change at one part of the wing's leading edge," said Chairman of the Atlantis Shuttle Mission team, John Shannon who also said that other sensors on Atlantis have not recorded the impact.Damage resulting from impact to a wing during liftoff caused Space Shuttle Columbia to disintegrate when it was re-entering Earth's atmosphere on February 1, 2003. As required by new routines put in place after the accident, astronauts will now have to use a camera or laser to determine if there is any damage to Atlantis's left wing or not. NASA has a spacewalk scheduled for today, but it is not known yet during which of the 3 remaining spacewalks they will be inspecting this .NASA says they do not believe that there is any damage, because the other sensors around the one that reported the anomaly did not register anything out of the ordinary, as they would be expected to do in case of an actual impact. However, they will examine the area to make sure.At least 70 people are dead and hundreds more injured after three earthquakes and several aftershocks rocked western Iran between Doroud and Boroujerd in the Lorestan province at 11:06 p.m. local time (1936 GMT) on Thursday. Some estimates of those injured currently range between 700-1,200 people.The first earthquake measured a 4.7 on the Richter magnitude scale and was in a mountainous area and the second measured a 5.1. The third quake measured a 6.0 and hit Doroud and the villages surrounding the area at 4:47 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Friday.According to the U.S. Geological Survey, however, a 5.7 magnitude quake occurred at 0117 UTC followed by an earthquake of 4.7 magnitude fifteen minutes later. They also report that the previous day, a quake measuring 4.7 in magnitude occurred in the same area.Power has been cut to some areas and there are reports of at least 330 villages that have been severely damaged. Some reports say that at least 20 villages have been destroyed. Thousands have been left homeless as a result.In December of 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake killed over 31,000 people and in February of 2005 a 6.4 eathquake killed 600 people near Zarand in the Kerman province.Several explosions hit popular tourist destination areas in Kuta Beach, Indonesia early today, killing at least 19 people and injuring 100 others.  Between 11:50 and 12:00 UTC, three explosions hit the Kuta Square and Jimbaran Beach, two popular Western tourist areas in Bali.The Indonesian national news agency, ANTARA, reported that the first two explosions occurred at 6:50 p.m. local time, near a Jimbaran food court and the third blast at 7:00 p.m. in Kuta Town Square. Other reports claim that the blasts occurred at around 7:15 p.m. The two major blasts are thought to have struck a crowded main square at central Kuta, and the other in a cafe on Jimbaran beach, near the Four Seasons Hotel, areas which are generally popular with Western tourists. At this time, it is not clear how many explosions were involved; however, 4 blasts have been reported. The bombings occurred just two days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and 11 days before the third anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombing.At least one woman was injured after a letter bomb exploded inside the Capita Group Plc building on Victoria Street, near Scotland Yard which is located in the central part of London, England. The woman was holding the bomb when it exploded and suffered injuries to her stomach and hands."We were called at around 9.40 this morning to reports of a suspect package at a business address in Victoria Street," said a spokesperson for Scotland Yard.Victoria Street has been shutdown from Westminster Abbey to Scotland Yard while rescuers and police investigate the incident."Officers are attending the scene to establish the circumstances. As a precaution, a cordon has been put in place around the scene," said another police spokesperson.The bomb was inside a "jiffy bag" which held the letter which was contained inside a padded envelope. The explosion occurred inside the office's mailroom.The woman who was injured was not believed to be the target. Police will not say to whom the letter was addressed.There are no reports of other injuries or deaths so far."We are not in a position to discuss who may or may not be responsible at this stage," said police.McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won from pole position his first FIA Formula-1 2007 Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montréal, Canada.Fernando Alonso, his teammate, made a mistake in the first chicane right after the start and Nick Heidfeld, BMW, slipped to the second place. Alonso fought hard to stay on the third place, but the pace car, which appeared four times today, spoiled his attempts. The double World Champion was penalized by 10 seconds stop-and-go, together with Nico Rosberg from Williams-Toyota, for the pit-stop error while the safety car was on the track. Alonso still battled for points, finishing in 7th place, 21.9 seconds behind his winning teammate. While Rosberg placed tenth as a result of this penalty, his teammate Alexander Wurz closed the podium third.It seemed that some of the Formula One drivers forgot how to drive under safety car conditions, resulting in the black flag (disqualification) for Felipe Massa, Ferrari and Giancarlo Fisichella, Renault.Two Finns, teammates for Fisichella and Massa, Heikki Kovalainen and Kimi Räikkönen placed 4th and 5th. Takuma Sato, Super Aguri-Honda driver placed 6th.The race featured a catastrophic accident with Robert Kubica from Poland, who crashed his BMW on the entry to the hairpin turn. There was nothing left of his car except the driver's monocoque which flew a considerable distance, bouncing from one concrete wall to another on the other side of the track. Kubica escaped the crash with just a sprained ankle and concussion, and has said he hopes to compete in the next race ( Indianapolis ).Three other causes of the safety car appearance were Vitantonio Liuzzi and Scott Speed from Toro Rosso-Ferrari and Adrian Sutil, from Spyker-Ferrari.This became the first Formula One victory for Lewis, after he won four consecutive second places in the previous races, with six consecutive podium finishes. He now leads the drivers' championship with 48 points, 8 ahead of Alonso. Team McLaren leads the constructors' championship with 88 points, 28 ahead of Ferrari.Six construction workers at Hong Kong's International Commerce Centre (ICC) were killed on Sunday when they fell seventeen stories down a lift shaft.The workers were standing on a platform on the 27th floor of the building when it collapsed.The ICC's building developers from Sun Hung Kail Properties, Ltd., said they would pay the families of the victims at least HK$1 million (US$129,000) apiece and pay for funeral costs. Donald Tsang, the city's CEO, said a full investigation into the incident would be launched.The International Commerce Centre, when completed, is to be the fourth tallest building in the world, with 118 stories. It is scheduled to open in 2010.BBC Wales and iPTV station VTV are reporting that a light aircraft made an emergency landing at 13:00 BST at Treforest Industrial Estate near Cardiff.The aircraft, an orange-coloured single-engine model Fox home-built kit was carrying two people when it made a forced landing on a section of dual carriageway within the industrial estate.It is not known how severely the man and woman on board were injured, a spokesperson for South Wales Police stated that both of the aircraft's occupants sustained "non life-threatening injuries".Treforest Industrial Estate is one of the largest business parks in the south Wales valleys. Its location, just two hundred metres from the main A470 expressway could have resulted in a far greater tragedy.VTV reporter and private pilot Craig Handley said that the location of the accident "would have been the most logical place to try and set the aircraft down as the dual carriageway, which runs through the estate, is clearly visible from the air and is almost completely straight and wide."Today's accident comes less than a year after a similar-sized aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing less than two miles away from Treforest Industrial Estate. A Cessna 150 suffered a sudden loss of engine power during its approach to nearby Cardiff International Airport.The Cessna in the earlier accident collided with a group of trees shedding its wings before coming to rest on a small country road.  The two occupants of that aircraft received slight injuries.South Wales Police have not confirmed whether any motorists or pedestrians were injured when the aircraft in today's accident made its emergency landing.  The aircraft did cause some structural damage to a factory unit on the industrial estate prior to coming to rest, inverted, on the adjacent dual carriageway.According to one eyewitness, the aircraft appeared to have experienced an engine-related problem seconds before impact.A spokesperson, for Cardiff International Airport said that the aircraft had departed from Cardiff at 12:43 BST and that the airport's Air Traffic Control centre had lost contact with the plane.The Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) have been informed and are due to begin their investigation into the crash.A father and his son escaped serious injury yesterday when their plane flipped over on landing at an air show at Defford Airfield, near Worcester, England. The crash occurred during Defford Air Day at 2:30pm local time, at a charitable event to raise money for the Mission Aviation Fellowship and the Warwickshire and Northants Air Ambulance. The plane involved was one of a range of both vintage and modern aircraft being showcased in front of hundreds of spectators at the event. The accident occurred at low speed as the plane landed. The forward wheel suddenly dug into the soft ground and stopped dead, causing the plane to flip forwards onto it's back. The 56-year-old pilot and his son escaped from the plane unaided.A land ambulance, a rapid response vehicle and the Warwickshire and Northants Air Ambulance provided emergency response at the scene. The older man was taken by land ambulance to hospital for an x-ray on his shoulder, but the younger man did not require hospital treatment. However, the air ambulance doctor could not rule out the possibility of spinal injuries.An investigation has begun to determine the cause of the accident.A lightning strike in Southern Norway’s Hardangervidda region has killed more than 300 wild reindeer, according to reports from local authorities. The bodies were discovered on Friday by a hunting warden at the Norwegian Nature Inspectorate located between Møsvatn and Kalhovd in Telemark County. Knut Nylend of the Norwegian Nature Inspectorate operations center told Sputnik News, "The deer were found dead in an area 50-80 meters in diameter". Due to an intense thunderstorm on Friday afternoon, Nylend suspects the herd were killed by a lightning strike.  The rare incident has left 323 deer dead, including 70 young calves and 5 others needing to be euthanized due to injury. A representative from Norway’s Environment Agency, Kjartan Knutsen, also spoke to the AFP. "There were very strong storms in the area on Friday. The animals stay close together in bad weather and these ones were hit by lightning."Although the close proximity of the bodies indicate they were killed by a lightning strike, further tests are underway.  Samples of the dead animals' blood and tissue will be examined for chronic wasting disease (CWD), which was detected in both Norwegian reindeer and elk earlier this year. It is still unclear what will happen to the carcasses and if they will be collected and disposed of.22 people have been killed in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and a women's cricket match has been interrupted due to lightning strikes during thunderstorms on Sunday. Most of the casualties were farmers, who worked in their fields despite the thunderstorms.Officials blamed a low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal for causing the heavy thunderstorms, which affected eight districts of Andhra Pradesh.Lightning during the storm killed a woman and her daughter-in-law while they were working on their farm, according to newspaper The Hindu. At another farm, a man was killed while drilling a well during the storms.Lightning interrupted a women's cricket team match by striking a nearby tree. The match was stopped mid-game, and both players and spectators fled the scene. The escape was "miraculous", according to a cricket official in the area where the match occurred.Even though the storms occurred during the monsoon season, when lightning strikes occur more frequently due to an increased amount of precipitation, the number of lightning-related casualties from Sunday's storms was considered by local authorities to be unexpectedly high.Several people were killed by lightning after thunderstorms struck Mumbai, India on Tuesday evening.Three people, including a woman, were killed and a twelve-year-old boy was hurt by the lightning in Navi Mumbai. The woman had been injured while selling lampshades on the street, and a third victim was also hurt while parking his motorcycle, trying to get out of the rain. The three were hospitalised immediately, but were declared dead upon arrival. The boy is currently undergoing treatment.Lightning was also seen in Kurla, Kalbadevi, Chembur, and Bandra-Kurla Complex, but according to the fire brigade no one was injured from those strikes. There was no water logging despite the heavy rains.Trains on Central Railway were affected by the weather and were half an hour behind schedule. The problem started around 07.00 p.m. Mumbai Time (+330 UTC) and lasted until almost 10.00 p.m. Flights were also delayed; 12 flights, including six Air India and two Kingfisher, were diverted to Ahmedabad as the pilots could not land at the Mumbai airport.At least 4 people are injured, one "very seriously", and at least one is dead after being struck by lightning during a thunderstorm which passed over a park located in Madison, Connecticut.According to the city's local chapter of the environmental Protection Agency, lightning struck a pavilion at approximately 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) at Hamonasset Beach State Park.The names ofthe victims have not yet been released. At least four people remained hospitalized.  Nearly 26,000 people are reported to have lost power when the storms moved through the area.The National Transportation Safety Committee of Indonesia on Monday announced the cockpit voice recorder from Lion Air Flight 610 has been recovered from the Java Sea. All 189 on the aircraft died when the flight came down last October.The device was located and recovered "broken into two pieces" from under eight metres (about 25 feet) of mud, according to investigators. The new Boeing 737 Max was not airworthy, investigators have said, and should not have taken off. It was commencing a journey from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang and hit the ocean at speed shortly after asking air traffic control to return. It disintegrated upon impact.The location of the device, and the location of the flight data recorder recovered in November, were around 50 m (165 ft) apart. Authorities said they found human remains nearby the second recorder.Lion Air has been funding extended searches for both the recorder and outstanding human remains. The aircraft had been operating for days with a malfunctioning airspeed indicator; its angle of attack sensor had recently been replaced. Preliminary investigations suggest a new feature on the 737 Max, which had not suffered a crash before, was forcing the nose down in an erroneous attempt to prevent an aerodynamic stall, while the pilots tried and failed to correct this.A frilled shark was spotted off the coast of Japan on January 21, 2007 and taken to the Awashima Marine Park in Shizuoka, Japan where it was filmed and later died."We believe moving pictures of a live specimen are extremely rare," said an official with the Awashima Marine Park.The frilled shark, Chlamydoselachus anguineus, is a member of a 350 million year old family, and characterised by an eel-like appearance with a distinctive protrusion of the gills. The 1.6m female specimen was spotted in shallow waters by a local fisherman who contacted the Awashima Marine Park who were able to catch the shark.The video is available on many websites including "YouTube" and shows the dying shark swimming around the aquarium with its mouth open.It is unknown as to why the shark was in such shallow waters, but officials say it might have been sick. Its usual habitat is between 120 meters and 1280 meters in depth where it feeds on squid and bony fish. The sharks grow to 2 meters in length and are regularly caught by bottom trawlers and used as fish bait."They live between 1,968 and 3,280 feet (600 and 1,000 meters) under the water, which is deeper than humans can go," added the park official."We think it may have come close to the surface because it was sick, or else it was weakened because it was in shallow waters," continued the official.This species is a living fossil, having a close resemblance to fossil records of paleozoic sharks. In comparison modern sharks have 5 sets of gills whereas the frilled shark has 6 sets.Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi, the only individual convicted in connection with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, has been released by Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, on compassionate grounds.Megrahi is suffering from terminal prostate cancer and will be allowed to return to his home country of Libya.270 people were killed when, on December 21, 1988, the Pan-Am flight from London's Heathrow Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport was destroyed by a bomb whilst in flight over southern Scotland.A police convoy escorted Megrahi from his former prison home in HMP Greenock to Glasgow Airport, where he boarded an Afriqiyah Airways flight to Tripoli. He was told he could not remain in Scotland on security grounds.In announcing the release on compassionate grounds, Justice Secretary MacAskill stated, "Al-Megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power. It is one that no court in any jurisdiction could revoke or overrule. It is terminal, final and irrevocable. He is going to die".The conviction remains controversial. Last year then-president of US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 told Wikinews that the vast majority were satisfied in Megrahi's guilt. UK Families Flight 103 painted a very different picture to Wikinews of the opinions in Britain: "UK Families have different views about Megrahi's guilt or innocence.  Certainly some, including my husband and I, believe that we are not in a position to make a judgment about whether he was involved in some way or not," said group coordinator Jean Berkley, whose son was killed. "Much of the evidence at the trial was circumstantial and confusing and it is a fact that the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, after considering the matter for three years, came to the conclusion that there were grounds for appeal. The UK families are united in believing that the full independent inquiry for which we have been asking since 1989 should now take place, to deal with the many unanswered questions and enable the evidence which would have emerged from the now abandoned appeal to be made public." This is in sharp contrast to The Daily Telegraph, which earlier reported that the majority of British families felt Megrahi was innocent.The United States government had been strongly opposed to any possible release. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had previously called the possibility "absolutely wrong". MacAskill sought to justify the decision by commenting that "Compassion and mercy are about upholding the beliefs th[at] we seek to live by, remaining true to our values as a people - no matter the severity of the provocation or the atrocity perpetrated."Megrahi issued a statement shortly before leaving HMP Greenock in which he maintained his innocence. "The remaining days of my life are being lived under the shadow of the wrongness of my conviction. I have been faced with an appalling choice: to risk dying in prison in the hope that my name is cleared posthumously or to return home still carrying the weight of the guilty verdict, which will never now be lifted. The choice which I made is a matter of sorrow, disappointment and anger, which I fear I will never overcome," said Megrahi.Robert Gibbs, press secretary for the White House, said "The United States deeply regrets the decision by the Scottish Executive to release Abdel Basset Mohamed al-Megrahi. As we have expressed repeatedly to officials of the government of the United Kingdom and to Scottish authorities, we continue to believe that Megrahi should serve out his sentence in Scotland." Many US victims have also reacted with anger. Many US victims' families have reacted with anger. One relative commented that "This might sound crude or blunt, but I want him returned from Scotland the same way my wife Lorraine was and that would be in a box." Dr. Jim Swire, a UK victim, disagreed, saying Megrahi had "nothing to do with" the disaster and calling the earlier dropping of the appeal "a blow to those of us who seek the truth."Megrahi's plane was greeted by crowds in Tripoli waving both Libyan and Scottish flags. Seif al-Islam, son of Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi, held his hand as he exited the aircraft amid heavy security. Loudspeakers broadcast patriotic music and it is reported that celebrations are ongoing in Tripoli.The High Court in Edinburgh has today accepted Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi's request to drop his second appeal against his conviction for the Lockerbie bombing. Al-Megrahi was found guilty of planting a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103, which detonated as the aircraft flew over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 killing all 259 people on board and eleven more on the ground.Megrahi has always protested his innocence. Although his appeal was dismissed in 2002, a review found evidence of a possible miscarriage of justice and granted Megrahi a second appeal. He is terminally ill with prostate cancer and may soon be released on compassionate grounds. Today's hearing was attended by the Reverend John Mosey, whose daughter was killed and who believes in Megrahi's innocence.The conviction remains controversial, with the majority of victims' families in the UK feeling Megrahi is innocent while those in the US believe him to be guilty according to the Daily Telegraph. Doctor Jim Swire, a member of UK Families Flight 103, has threatened to sue the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service over what he feels is a deliberate blocking of justice. Meanwhile, in an earlier interview with Wikinews on the twentieth anniversary of the bombing last year, the then-head of the US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, Kara Weipz, told Wikinews that "There is no difference between the truth as we see it and the official version of events. The facts are the facts, Mr. Megrahi is guilty."Wikinews has obtained a statement from Mrs. Weipz's replacement Frank Duggan. In it Duggan maintains that Megrahi should die behind bars in Scotland, casts doubt on the likelihood of a transfer to Libya and attacks the Scottish media's coverage of the case. Dr. Swire has also been contacted with a request to comment."The murderer appealed again, and now seeks, without apparent reason, to withdraw that appeal. The court had little discretion, and absent some grandstanding from the bomber’s attorneys, it is certainly not what the Scottish media is making it out to be. It is NOT the key to Mr. Megrahi's release pursuant to the Prisoner Transfer Agreement, since Article 5 of that agreement states that there cannot be any pending legal action against him. There is, as everyone should know, another appeal pending, which was originally filed before Megrahahi's, objecting to the lenience of the sentence for the murder of 270 innocent souls. In addition, Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill must still rule on the request for transfer, a request made by [Libyan President] Muammar Gadhafi, who has admitted his nation’s guilt in the most egregious case of state-sponsored terrorism in UK history. It is simply inconceivable to us that the Scottish government would respect the wishes of this man. "The American victim’s families cannot understand why Megrahi would withdraw his appeal, unless his attorneys thought that they were not persuading Minister MacAskill that the bomber was indeed on his deathbed. That is a more likely scenario since they had been saying he had one foot in the grave for the past year. If the rumors of his impending release, fueled by the Herald, Guardian, Scotsman and other “newspapers” were meant to test public opinion about his release, either by Prisoner Transfer or Compassionate Release, then the trial balloon was successful. There has been worldwide outrage and opprobrium that this man might get to go home to a hero’s welcome in Libya. "The only other reason we can imagine is that his attorneys were not aware of the other pending appeal, and are perhaps taking advice from that legal scholar, Prof. Robert Black, who still maintains that there was insufficient evidence in the first trial and appeal. Black has been wrong about every step of this case from the beginning, yet he and Dr. James Swire are given full opportunity to express their views of the evidence in the UK “newspapers.”"The convicted bomber should not be transferred under any subsequent agreement since the arrangements for the trial in the Netherlands promised that if convicted, the defendant would serve his prison term in Scotland. As to the application for release on compassionate grounds, this has caused the most uproar around the world. News media, not so many in Scotland I regret to say, wonder just how much compassion was shown by Megrahi and Libya when they planted a bomb designed to murder hundreds of innocent, unsuspecting lives."Megrahi is now set to complete his sentence in HMP Greenock, where he is to serve a minimum of 27 years, barring any further developments.In a press conference this morning, the Metropolitan Police Service has announced that the death toll from yesterday's bombing has risen to "more than 50". (Initial reports had put it at 33, rising in later reports to 37.) Police are unable to give an exact figure at this moment due to the difficulty of removing bodies, and believe the figure is likely to rise. Some bodies have yet to be recovered from the Piccadilly line train caught between Kings Cross and Russell Square.However speaking at the press conference, Metropolitan Police chief Sir Ian Blair said he did not expect the death toll to reach three figures. The total number of casualties remains at 700, with 350 requiring hospital treatment. Twenty-two people remain in hospital in a serious condition, with one person dying.West Yorkshire Police searched six houses in Leeds today in connection with the London bombings.  Houses were searched in the Burley, Beeston and Holbeck areas.  Further properties were searched in Dewsbury, about eight miles from the city centre.  The raids began at 6:30am BST this morning after warrants were issued under the Terrorism Act 2000.  Police are still in attendance at one property, and are describing the searches as significant, and "intelligence led".Access to one house was gained using a robot-deployed controlled explosion.  Other houses were entered by armed police.London Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair said that the operation "is directly connected to the outrages on Thursday".  A "significant amount" of explosives was recovered from the Burley property.  Following the discovery of the explosive, military bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene.  Around 600 people were evacuated from the surrounding area.  Temporary food and shelter is being provided by the local council at Kirkstall Leisure Centre, a mile away.Police have revealed that the Tavistock Square bus bomb did not explode until nearly an hour after the bombs on the Underground system detonated.The bomb exploded at 9.47am, while all three Tube bombs exploded within 50 seconds of each other at 8.50am.Police are looking into "every possibility" as to why the bomb exploded such a long time after the others, and are not ruling anything in or out.However they have stated that the bomb, consisting of 5kg of high explosives, was in a bag on the floor or on a seat at the rear of the upper deck - and not strapped to a person.At the scene of the blast itself a meticulous finger tip search is taking place to find evidence. The roof of the bus has been taken away for a thorough forensic examination.The bus itself will be removed in due course.The bus was fitted with an internal CCTV system, but it has not yet been stated if it was working. However the bus was seen by numerous traffic cameras as it made its journey that morning, and police are reviewing hours of footage.Thirteen people died in the blast outside the British Medical Association building.Twenty-four hours after a series of bomb blasts rocked London, the city's transport system is returning to normal, although a series of security alerts have caused some disruption.All the major train stations are now open, with the only service alteration being at King's Cross, where GNER is operating a revised service. Suburban services in and out of King's Cross are normal.On the London Underground, services are running on most lines with only some delays. Four lines are still seriously affected though:Piccadilly line: No service from Hyde Park Corner to Arnos Grove. Buses are running from Arnos Grove to Finchley Central to connect with Northern line services.Circle and Hammersmith & City lines: closedMetropolitan line: no trains running between Baker Street and AldgateDistrict line: no service from High Street Kensington to Edgware RoadThe King's Cross St Pancras station is also closed.On the roads, the London Congestion Charge has been suspended, although Transport for London is advising against driving in central London today.Several roads remain closed as of 9.20am BST - the A11 (Aldgate Highstreet) and the A1211 at the A10 in Bishop's Gate are both shut to traffic. The A4200 (Eversholt Street) is closed between the junctions with the A501 (Euston Road) and the A40 (Vernon Place).The A3212 (Millbank) is closed between the A3203 (Westminster) and the A202 (Vauxhall Bridge Road).Finally, the B452 (Argyle Road / Drayton Green Road) is closed between Sutherland Road and Manor Road.Outside of London, the motorway network is running well.One Wikinews reporter in Central London noted how many more cyclists there were, especially in Hyde Park.After a press conference in London from the Metropolitan Police and Transport for London, more details are emerging about the attacks in London on Thursday.Data from the Underground system's power and control systems have revealed that all three bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other, at 8.50am, with the managing director of Transport for London, Tim O'Toole saying the bombs went "bang bang bang, very close together".The first bomb to detonate was on the Liverpool Street train soon after it left for Aldgate on the Circle line, seconds before the others. The blast tripped out the power system, visible in the control room. The first call the police received that morning reported "a bang" at Aldgate East, coming within a minute of the blast.The Edgware Road train, leaving for Paddington and also on the Circle, exploded opposite a train coming from the other direction, making people think at first that it was a derailment. The first call to the Police spoke not of an explosion, but of a person falling under the wheels of the train. The confirmation of a bomb did not come until 9.17am, but by that time the emergency services were already on scene.Transport for London's new TrackerNet software is fully opertational on the Circle line, which allows for precise tracking of trains, but is not yet fully installed on the Piccadilly line. The first indication of the Piccadilly line bomb was when the tunnel telephone system wires were cut by the blast, an event logged by other software. The cutting of the lines then tripped out the track current. The tunnel itself suffered only slight damage and is safe, but the train - which was packed with commuters heading for Russell Square - is very badly damaged.London Underground declared a 'code Amber' within minutes, moving trains to platforms and opening all doors. A 'code Red' - full evacuation - was set at around 9.15am. O'Toole described the decision to evacuate as being "very grave, not taken lightly". When questioned as to whether everything possible had been done on the day to save lives, the managing director of Transport for London was "very proud" of the choices made that morning.As investigations continue, all bodies have been removed from the sub-surface Circle line trains, but the carriages themselves are still in situ while a painstaking forensic investigation takes place.Currently, work is on-going to retrieve bodies and forensic evidence from the carriage of the train in the deep tunnel of the Piccadilly line near King's Cross. Teams of rescue workers looking for human remains are working alongside forensics experts in a "meticulous" search to find evidence.Conditions are described as being very difficult, with high temperatures and lots of dust. Work was halted over Friday night when conditions became too bad, and resumed this morning. Efforts have been made to improve the ventilation.Work will continue throughout tonight and possibly into Sunday. The exact number of bodies still in the wrecked carriage is unknown.Access from King's Cross is impossible, so workers are taking the longer route from Russell Square station to get to the front of the train.Police have revealed that the bombs were 'high explosives' - not homemade. However they are declining to be specific about their composition as the information could be useful when they interrogate suspects.Police will not confirm or deny if any parts of a timer have been found, but have said that "any device will now be in a million pieces". Police believe the use of timers more likely than suicide bombings as the blasts were so closely timed, but are not ruling out anything.A westbound London Underground train has derailed between Mile End and Bethnal Green on the Central Line shortly after 9am BST during the morning rush-hour leaving hundreds of passengers stranded who had to walk along the tracks to leave at the nearest station.Transport for London have said that 20 people received medical attention with five taken to hospital with minor injuries including breathing difficulties. A lot of dust is said to have been disturbed during the incident.A London Underground spokesman said that "We are investigating a report that at around 9am this morning a Central Line train derailed in a tunnel between Mile End and Bethnal Green. LU is looking into reports that there was an obstruction on the track."Passengers initially feared that a bomb had exploded but a TfL employee on the train was able to calm the situation by suggesting that he thought it was a derailment. This was later confirmed by the train driver.Chris Christofi who was on the train described what had happened to the BBC: "We felt a massive jolt underneath the train which caused the train to move up and down and sideways. There were some windows that seemed to blow in and explode and there was some soot that came into the carriage. There was a lot of people crying and upset, a lot of people falling over. We thought there'd been a bomb."  In a statement, British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Ellie Bird said that "there is nothing to suggest that this a terrorist-related incident".Central Line services remain suspended between Leytonstone and Liverpool Street causing severe delays on the rest of the line.The London Fire Brigade are currently tackling what they have described as a "major fire" at Camden Market in London.Early eyewitness reports state that a "strong smell of gas" and "explosions" preceded the blaze, which reportedly has a number of people trapped.Local bar patrons have been evacuated away from the danger zone, as over 20 fire engines and about 100 firefighters attempt to contain the blaze, which has shooting flames "30 feet in the air". Nearby houses and flats are also being evacuated, and roads near the fire are also being sealed off.London Ambulance Service reports no casualties so far.The London Underground service was disrupted today due to a man being caught under a train near Marble Arch Station in the city of Westminster, Central London. According to British Transport Police officials,"on Wednesday 9 August 2006 at 16:30 the Central line was suspended between Liverpool Street and White City due to a person under a westbound train at Marble Arch. The person was confirmed deceased at 17:20. At 19:45  service resumed from Liverpool Street and White City. There was severe delays on the Central line until the close of traffic.[sic]"The incident affected the Underground's Central Line between Liverpool Street Station and White City Station. According to Underground staff, the Central Line service on this route was suspended at 17:20 local time. On stations that connect to the Central Line, passengers were informed that "service for the Central Line is suspended until further notice" and that their "...tickets will be valid for all local traffic." In addition to announcements over loudspeaker, passengers were advised of the interruption with notices on white boards inside of most stations in Central London. While Marble Arch Station was closed off, additional buses were made available by the city to carry Underground passengers from Central Line connection points like Bond Street Station to their intended destinations.  The scene outside of Marble Arch station brought back memories of last year's train bombings: Underground staff, as well as police officers blocked the entrance to the station, and advised passengers to use alternate means of transportation; meanwhile, vehicles from the London Underground Emergency Response Unit, as well as police cars were standing by outside the station. British Trasport Police did not release further details about the accident.By 20:00 local time, London Underground staff confirmed that service on the Central Line had been fully restored. "Yes, they're all open" said an Underground associate when asked whether Marble Arch Station had resumed service. By 23:00 local time, however, the Central Line service still reported "severe delays" on some stations. On Thursday, August 10th, the Central Line was operating normally again, but the service interruption was overshadowed by the breaking news regarding a plot to detonate explosives on airplanes flying from the UK to the United States.Train accidents on the Tube are not uncommon: the London Underground reports 53 injuries last year and continues to advise passengers to "mind the gap between the train and the platform" when trains arrive, and to "stand clear of the closing doors," in order to help ensure a safe journey. In addition, passengers are also advised to carry a bottle of water with them on hot days to avoid heat-related injuries and to remember to "take all their belongings with them when [they] leave the train, in order to avoid station closures and security alerts."The closure of Marble Arch Station was not the only service interruption on Wednesday; according to its web site, London Underground reports that Baker Street Station was also closed down due to a gas leak. The station reopened Thursday afternoon, but some delays were reported.At least 25 people have been killed and many more injured when a Metrolink commuter train collided yesterday afternoon with a Union Pacific freight train in the Chatsworth district of Los Angeles. Around 250 firefighters have responded to the accident scene. Estimates are that 350-400 people were on the number 111 commuter train which departed from Los Angeles' Union Station at 3:35pm PDT. The collision occurred on Friday at about 4:25pm PDT on Metrolink's Ventura County Line. The area in which the crash took place is hilly and contains a single track; it is just north of the Chatsworth Metrolink station.The force of the collision sent the locomotive of the Metrolink train to penetrate deep into the lead bi-level passenger car of the three-car train. The collision then knocked the Union Pacific and Metrolink locomotives on their side along with the lead passenger car. According to various sources, upwards of 10-15 passengers, possibly even more than 20, have been killed, including a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer. The LAPD has not released the name of the officer.  The engineer of the Metrolink train is believed to be another of the fatalities.The number of injured is believed to be 135, although the precise number is still unclear. According to emergency responders, the injured have been transported to Los Angeles area hospitals, including the University of California, Northridge Hospital Medical Center,  Providence Holy Cross Medical Center and Huntington Hospital.“This is the worst accident I’ve ever seen. Clearly the injuries are going to mount and so are the fatalities,” Mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, said.It is unclear how the accident occurred. Some of the possibilities include a signal malfunction, a failure by a crew member to notice a signal or a lapse in protocol for moving trains safely in the area. According to Metrolink and the Los Angeles Times, the National Transportation Safety Board has a team on scene and is investigating.In an apparently unrelated incident less than an hour after the crash in Chatsworth, another Metrolink train collided with a car in Corona, California, killing the female driver of the automobile.Saturday evening, at approximately 7:00 p.m. PST on Mt. Washington in Los Angeles, California, a brush fire broke out on the southwestern side of the hill.Firefighters were on the scene by 8:30 p.m. with fire trucks, paramedic units, surveillance helicopters, and water-equipped helicopters.  Two fire trucks blasted water at the blaze from higher up on the mountain, while every minute or so, a water-equipped helicopter would swoop down over the flames and release its payload.  At the top of the hill, there were five fire trucks and one paramedic unit; the three main entrances to the mountain were barricaded off by fire trucks.  By approximately 9:15 p.m., the flame was entirely extinguished, thanks mainly to the water-equipped helicopters.  Firefighters were offering bystanders bottles of water and Gatorade to help combat the effects of standing near an open flame.The recent wildfires in Los Angeles, California, have burned more than 42,000 acres (17,000 hectares) of land. Nearly 1,000 homes were destroyed, and more than 10,000 residents were evacuated. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa expressed concerns that Los Angeles was on the verge of a blackout, and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has declared the situation a state of emergency. In terms of property damage, this fire is the worst since the Bel Air fire in 1961. Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky stated, "Whether you live in a mobile home park or you live in an estate, when you lose your home it's devastating."In Montecito, a census-designated place in Santa Barbara County, the homes of many celebrities, including Steven Spielberg, Steve Martin, Eric Schmidt, and Rob Lowe, have been destroyed. This massive fire has caused millions of dollars of damage and 13 injuries. Rob Lowe declared that "it was just like Armageddon."According to one official, the fire started when ten students lit a bonfire on a ridge but failed to extinguish it. Although Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown believes that "this fire was the result of carelessness, not criminal intent," the county district attorney will still have to review the case.Santa Ana winds with gusts up to 70 mph exacerbated the Montecito fire, which destroyed over 100 buildings and damaged many others, including Westmont College. The college's 1000 students were forced to take shelter in the gymnasium.A spokesman for the college, Scott Craig, described the scene: "I saw flames about 100 feet high in the air shooting up with the wind just howling. Now when the wind howls and you've got palm trees and eucalyptus trees that are literally exploding with their hot oil, you've got these big, red hot embers that are flying through the sky and are catching anything on fire."Officials now report that firefighters are making some progress. Of the three major fires, the Montecito Tea Fire is 95% contained; the Sayre Fire, 70%; and the Triangle Complex Fire, 75%. Officials have lifted the evacuation order for Chino Hills as well.A one-inch settlement of the roof of The Bay tunnel to the Montreal Metro caused authorities to evacuate 12 blocks of the Montreal downtown core. Several people noticed water infiltration in the tunnel over the last few days. On Friday, August 24, at 1 p.m., while investigating another water infiltration incident, The Bay employees noticed that the ceiling of the tunnel portion of The Bay's basement sales area had descended one inch over a 7 meter length. They subsequently called police. The police and firefighters evacuated the basement of the downtown Bay store. The police closed de Maisonneuve Boulevard from Aylmer Street to Union Street, over the area of the crack.At 4 p.m., firefighters evacuated the Parkade Montreal Building and The Bay Department Store after finding pieces of concrete falling from the Parkade Montreal structure, a multi-story carpark with five levels of offices on top. They also evacuated the downtown portion of the Line 1 / Green Line of the Montreal Metro subway, from Lionel-Groulx to Berri-UQAM stations, and evacuated the McGill metro station, which is situated below The Bay tunnel. After consulting with city engineers, Centre 2001, the loading dock of the Bay and its Hertz car rental agency, Les Promenades Cathedrale underground shopping centre and office tower, and a neighbouring office tower to the Parkade were also evacuated. Police cordoned off an area from Bleury Street in the east to University Street in the west, and from Ste-Catherine Street in the south to President Kennedy Street to the north.The closure of the Metro caused havoc to the Friday afternoon rush hour, as over 40,000 people regularly use the Green Line (Line 1) every day. Montreal Transit Corporation workers issued directions during the day, though some may not have been informed of a provisionary bus service to replace the lost subway service. Loudspeakers announced that commuters should use the unaffected Orange Line (Line 2), which has lines between 5 and 10 blocks south of Line 1 (Green Line), and also connects to Lionel-Groulx and Berri-UQAM stations. The downtown area is intended to remain closed for at least the weekend, along with portions of the underground city, or RESO. The tunnel was built in 1966. For the last few days, city work crews have been working above the slab in question, digging a one meter trench to install a median and segregate a new bike path on de Maisonneuve Boulevard. The tunnel roof lies five meters below street level. Residents of Montreal are frustrated with the crumbling infrastructure in and around the city, including the collapse of the de la Concorde Boulevard overpass over Autoroute 19 expressway last year, the shattering of a column holding up the Autoroute 720 Ville Marie elevated expressway last month, and other incidents.Ivor van Heerden, Deputy Director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center and director of the Center for the Study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes, is warning that floodwaters resulting from Hurricane Katrina could carry toxic waste from the "Industrial Canal" area in New Orleans - the site of many chemical plants. Van Heerden has, for four years, studied computer models about the impact of a powerful hurricane."These chemical plants [could] start flying apart, just as the other buildings do, so we have the potential for release of benzene, hydrochloric acid, chlorine and so on." said van Heerden; "we're looking at a bowl full of highly contaminated water with contaminated air flowing around and, literally, very few places for anybody to go where they'll be safe."Van Heerden itemized problems people returning to the city would find: "no sewage, no drinking water, contamination, threat of rapid increase in mosquitoes, roads are impassible, downed power lines everywhere, trees, debris from houses in the roads, no way to go shopping, no gas." The water has also released fire ants and thousands of snakes, many being venomous, from their normal habitats."If you came back, you would be coming literally to a wilderness," van Heerden said. "Stay where you are, be comfortable; nothing's going to change. If your house is gone, it's gone. If you come back in a day or a week, it's not going to make any difference."CNN is reporting "huge police roadblocks" leading into New Orleans and that their news truck was not allowed to enter the city. The CNN correspondent said the other side of the roadblock looked like "a scene out of hell".State Police in Lafayette, Louisiana, have been accused of hindering attempts by private citizens to rescue people trapped by floodwaters in New Orleans. The accusations were contained in an unconfirmed report received via email by Jason Robideaux, an attorney from Lafayette.The email was written by a person who claimed to be part of "a group of approximately 1,000 citizens pulling 500 boats" heading into New Orleans to rescue people still stranded in places such as hospitals. The email claimed that the members of the flotilla were ".. experienced boaters, licensed fishermen and hunters, people who have spent their entire adult life and teenage years on the waterways of Louisiana."The email reports that a Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries (DWF) agent ordered them to turn around and go home. "We then specifically asked the DWF agent that we (and other citizens in the flotilla) be allowed to go to the hospitals and help evacuate the sick and the doctors and nurses stranded there. We offered to bring these people back to Lafayette, in our own vehicles, in order to ensure that they received proper and prompt medical care," the email said. "The DWF agent did not want to hear this and ordered us home. We complied with the DWF agent's orders, turned around and headed back to Lafayette along with half of the flotillia. However, two of my friends were pulling my other boat, a smaller 15ft alumaweld with a 25 hp. The DWF agents let them through to proceed to the rescue operation launch site," the email continued. The email also reported hundreds of DWF agents who were not being utilised. "My two friends were allowed to drive to the launch site where the La. Dept. of Wildlife and Fisheries were launching their rescue operations (via boat). They reported to me that there were over 200 DWF agents just standing around and doing nothing. My friends were kept there for approximately 3 hours. During that time they observed a large number of DWF agents doing nothing. After three hours had passed they were told that they were not needed and should go home. They complied with the DWF's orders and turned around and went home to Lafayette," the email said.A newborn baby girl in Malaysia has died after a macaque took her from her home, mauled her, and then dropped her off a rooftop. According to reports, the young girl was asleep in the living room of her home when the monkey seized her, carried her to the rooftop, and bit her face and neck before discarding her.After discovering the infant was missing, her family searched their home until they found her body outside the house.  State wildlife and national parks director Ishak Muhamad suggested that the macaque was probably scavenging for food and snatched the baby for this reason. Muhamad confirmed that the monkey responsible was tracked down and killed."The baby died when it fell to the ground. The monkey had apparently released the newborn, probably because it was alarmed by the parents' shouts", he stated.Sources say the newborn died en route to hospital.According to assistant wildlife official Mohd Zafifi Ramli, macaques in Malaysia are moving into urban areas due to population pressure and shrinking natural habitats, and because people in urban areas feed them.Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, New York City, was evacuated due to a two-alarm fire on Sunday. The fire started in an escalator and smoke began to spread throughout the department store. Nobody was seriously injured, however thick smoke was present. The fire was reported at 16:00 EDT (21:00 UTC) and the store reopened at around 18:00 EDT (23:00 UTC) and will stay open until 18:00 EDT Christmas eve, according to Macy's spokesperson Elina Kazan."Real smoky, you could hardly breathe on the third floor [...] everybody had to wear masks." shopper Raysha Oliver said to the local CBS affiliate.  Oliver also said that those without masks had to cover their faces with cloths. Customers were still attempting to complete purchases "I got some already, but had to put the rest of it aside," Oliver said.New York City Fire Department officials estimate that about 5000 customers were displaced during the fire, although some waited the two hours for the store to reopen. Shopper Stanley Rafal said that "it's going to kill a lot of business." Macy's executive Patti Lee said that she could not estimate the financial toll which the fire took and that "We're just pleased no one was hurt".42 people are reported dead and more than 120 are reported injured on the Portuguese island of Madeira after severe rainstorms triggered floods and mudslides. There are still people missing, and authorities say that the death toll will likely rise further. The worst affected area of the island is the southern coast, including the largest city, Funchal.According to an eyewitness, the infrastructure of the area was "decimated" by the flooding; water flooded down streets, leaving debris in its wake and destroying roads and bridges. In some localities, residents were evacuated, and services such as power and telephone lines have been severely disrupted. Emergency services have been hampered by the damage, and rescue crews are still unable to reach some mountainous regions. The storms have left hundreds of people homeless, in addition to the dead and injured.The government is considering declaring a state of emergency on the island, and local authorities have authorized relief supplies such as temporary housing for the homeless. Prime minister Jose Socrates has issued a statement saying "I am absolutely saddened and shocked with the images [from the scene], [and] with the consequences of this calamity."  He is expected to travel to Madeira sometime soon to inspect the damage and co-ordinate relief efforts.  The Portuguese military has already sent rescue teams to the area to aid in the recovery efforts, and the Spanish government has offered assistance.The 32-story Windsor Tower, located in the business district of Madrid, Spain, was devastated by the largest fire in the city's history.The fire destroyed large parts of the building, completely gutting the top 14 floors. Parts of the structure collapsed during the blaze, which was extinguished on Sunday evening. The 106m high tower is now extremely unstable, and experts believe there is a chance it could collapse in the next 24 hours. Surrounding areas have been evacuated, traffic diverted, and trains stopped on the three subway lines beneath the building.The fire is believed to have been started by an electrical short-circuit on the 21st floor. No-one was in the building (which was undergoing refurbishment) at the time of the blaze; the only casualties being three firefighters treated for smoke inhalation.The top twenty floors of the building housed the Deloitte & Touche auditing firm. The remains will be demolished at a future date.An apartment building collapsed on Monday in Magnitogorsk, a city in the Ural region of Russia. A suspected gas leak led to an explosion, followed by the ten-storey building coming down. A total of 39 are confirmed dead, officials told state media, adding that rescuers ended their work yesterday. Some reports suggest a deliberate criminal act.The 1973 building was home to over 1,000 people; 48 apartments were damaged. Rescuers, working in temperatures well below freezing, according to the emergencies ministry recovered at least ten survivors from the debris on Monday. The building was evacuated. Over 1,000 rescuers responded.The Investigative Committee and the Federal Security Service (FSB) said they believe gas, which leaks relatively frequently in Russia, was the trigger for the disaster which occurred at 6am as many occupants slept. President Vladimir Putin was briefed, and flew to Magnitogorsk on Monday, observing the rescue mission and visiting the wounded in hospital. In a meeting that day he was told by Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev of "presumably between 36 and 40 people under the rubble", while Chelyabinsk regional Deputy Governor Oleg Klimov indicated 68 people were missing. Search and rescue was suspended on Tuesday, with Zinichev describing the "real threat of [another] part of the building collapsing" as making it "impossible to continue working in such conditions", and work launched to stabilise the remaining structure. He estimated this would take 24 hours. Cranes were used to hoist workers into position to demolish sections deemed dangerous. Rescue work resumed on Wednesday, with additional bodies recovered increasing the confirmed death toll from fourteen to 31."The search and rescue operation is complete," Deputy Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Chupriyan told TASS on Wednesday. Chelyabinsk's governor has promised each victim will be subject to a payout of one million rubles.Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova indicated on Monday the chances of those trapped being found alive were already diminishing. On Tuesday an eleven-month-old boy, identified only as Ivan, was rescued alive and flown to Moscow for treatment of injuries including frostbite, leg fractures, and head trauma. He was found under rubble, still in his cot after having been trapped for over 30 hours. Ivan's condition was on Wednesday reported to not be life-threatening.The Emergencies Ministry said six deaths were of children.On the night of Monday to Tuesday another explosion hit a gas-powered minibus in the city. Officials said three people died; their identities were not provided. Both explosions took place on Karl Marx Avenue, within two miles of each other.The FSB denies the two explosions are related; reports describe speculation the disaster's cause was not in fact a gas leak. One news site, Znak.com, claims FSB sources have ascribed the explosion to terrorism. The Investigative Committee says it has found no trace of explosives despite Znak.com claiming an anonymous source described a second-floor apartment being used as an explosives depot ahead of a planned shopping centre bombing. Znak.com further reported its source said that apartment's tenant moved in the day before the blast.Regional governor Boris Dubrovsky said FSB officers were present where the minibus exploded outside the local administrative building, but said this too was unrelated to the other explosion. Znak.com reported its source said "three terrorists" were killed in a firefight on Monday night, while footage from the scene showed the vehicle burn amid what sounds like gunfire.The website further reported its anonymous source claimed a fourth offender escaped and remains wanted. Monday saw armed police with dogs searching a second apartment block in Magnitigorsk. Residents there told the press the officers claimed to be seeking a bomb.A magnitude 3.6 earthquake occurred on Friday near Washington, D.C., capital of the United States.

The epicenter was located 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Christchurch; 190 kilometers (115 miles) south-southeast of Westport; 295 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of Wellington; and 320 kilometers (200 miles) north-northeast of Dunedin. New Zealand's Civil Defence Minister John Carter has declared a state of emergency in Christchurch and Selwyn District.Widespread damage extending beyond Christchurch has damaged infrastructure, including substantial disruption to the power and water supply. Two people were reported seriously injured, and local residents have also reported that chimneys have fallen in through roofs, ceilings cracked and brick walls collapsed. Several aftershocks were also felt as far north as New Plymouth.Bob Parker, the mayor of Christchurch, told the New Zealand Herald that he is "thankful there has been no loss of life but there had been considerable damage across the city and outlying areas." "We are very happy and blessed that no one died," Prime Minister John Key said; he further pledged that "we are here to support them. We are not going to let Christchurch suffer this great tragedy on their own."People in the Christchurch area have been told not to enter the CBD, and a curfew has been established there from 7pm to 7am. Other towns have also had parts closed off to be inspected for safety. The NOAA's evaluation of the situation predicts that significant damage will not progress beyond New Zealand: "Based on the earthquake magnitude, location and historic tsunami records, a damaging tsunami is not expected along the California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska coasts. At coastal locations which have experienced strong ground shaking, local tsunamis are possible due to underwater landslides."A significant earthquake has impacted Mexico on a part of the coast bordering the Pacific Ocean. No fatalities have been reported thus far.The United States Geological Survey [USGS] has registered the magnitude of the earthquake today as 7.4.

All tsunami warnings were subsequently canceled.The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) reported today a "significant explosive event" had occurred at Mount Redoubt in Alaska.  Lightning was observed within an ash cloud that formed over the volcano.  As a result the AVO raised the alert level to 'warning' and level 'red' for aviation. The event occurred at 6:00 a.m. (AKDT).According to the Observatory, seismic activity caused a major lahar, similar to a mudslide or landslide, to occur in the Drift River Valley. Inhabitants of the Valley were advised to seek high ground and take immediate precautions against flooding. So far there are no reports of injuries or evacuations. Wikinews has e-mailed the AVO for a statement regarding the event, but has yet to receive a reply."Strong, but diminishing seismic activity is continuing as of 07:35 AKDT," said the AVO on its website. At 9:18 a.m., the AVO reported that the event had ended. "Continuing seismic activity and web camera images indicate that low level emissions of steam, gas, and some volcanic ash are continuing to be emitted at the volcano at altitudes of [20,000 feet]." The AVO is sending a team to investigate the latest eruption which will include a fly-over to take readings on the gases being emitted.The explosion sent volcanic ash which spread to "Homer, Anchor Point, and Seldovia" to an altitude of over 50,000 feet.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued an advisory stating that ash fall can be expected from "Ninilchik Southward through mid morning."  The advisory is scheduled to end at 10:00 a.m. (AKDT).As a result of recent eruptions at Redoubt, half of the 6 million gallons of crude oil stored in the Drift Valley will be removed to a safer location. There is no word on when the move will take place. The storage facility is located just 22 miles from Redoubt.A series of large explosions have occurred close to Hemel Hempstead  Hertfordshire, UK. The source of the explosions has been confirmed as the Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal (HOSL), Hemel Hempstead, known locally as the Buncefield complex. Up to  150 fire fighters are reported to be at the scene with 10 fire appliances and 1 specialist foamer.The first 'blast' was heard near Hemel Hempstead on Sunday 11 Dec at 6 am. Further smaller explosions followed at 6:24am , 6:26am, 6:30am. BBC News 24 reported an additional, fourth large explosion.  Hertfordshire Police Constabulary are currently treating the explosion as an accident.  Reports say the explosion, which registered 2.4 on the Richter scale, was heard as far away as Oxford, and Whitehall, Central London which is 60km (38 miles) away. Eyewitness statements report that the explosion was heard from at least 160km (100 miles) away and as far away as France and The Netherlands. Pilots reported noticing the blast from the North Sea and the West Country area of the UK.  The M1 motorway which runs close by has been closed in both directions near the blast which is causing travel chaos as other roads become congested.Malcom Stewart, a BBC News24 eyewitness who is a tanker driver for the site has reported that the site supplies several oil companies and is a joint operation between Total UK and Texaco, it is also used by BP, Shell and the British Pipeline association. The complex is not a refinery but a storage facility for refined petroleum awaiting distribution to airports and filling stations. The eyewitness reports that the depot has approximately 20 tanks which can hold about 3 million gallons (11 million litres or 70,000 barrels) each.  Another News24 eyewitness has just reported that he has seen at least 5 of these tanks on fire.The depot operates on a 24 hour basis and is split into 2 parts - aviation fuel and domestic fuel.  A number of eyewitnesses have reported on UK news that the aviation fuel side appears to be the part of the site that has been affected.Local authorities were not immediately available for comment but there have been reports of casualties.Some reports on live television state that, "Several other neighbours said they did see a plane go into the depot."  BBC News 24 were also discussing the idea a possible plane crash as the cause of the explosions.  Hertfordshire police have now gone on the record to say that there is no plane involved (BBC News24).The police have issued a contact number 0800 096 0095 and asked that people do not call the emergency services in Hertfordshire directly unless it is an emergency. In addition to being an oil storage depot, it is a major hub on the UK oil pipeline network with pipelines to Killingholme Lindsey Oil Refinery (LOR), Humberside (10 inch), Merseyside (10 and 12 inch), Coryton on the Thames Estuary (14 inch) and Heathrow (6 and 8 inch) and Gatwick airports radiating from it.The disaster is believed to be the worst explosion at a petrochemical plant in the UK since the Flixborough disaster of 1974.Hertfordshire's Chief Fire Officer Roy Wilsher said: "This is possibly the largest incident of its kind in peacetime Europe." A firefighting press officer said that they are stock piling foam from neighboring regions for a prolonged attach which they hope will stop the spread of the fire, however, the inferno itself will have to burn out which could take between 24 hours and a few days.Despite the authorities saying that there is no need to panic buy petrol, filling stations have had above average queues since this morning and some small garages have ran out.Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has visited the scene.A huge fire that started in the cargo area has engulfed part of Turkey's Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul. All flights to and from the airport have been diverted and major fire-fighting efforts are in progress. Hundreds of people have evacuated the area, which is about 1 kilometre away from the passenger terminal.A witness told Turkish news channel NTV that the blaze broke out in the cargo area of Terminal A, presumably due to an electrical spark, at around 12:30 UTC. The area in which the fire is raging is near the location of the fuel depots. Unconfirmed reports suggest that there were about 250 cargo-handlers present there but most of them seem to have escaped unharmed.Thirty metre high plumes of smoke are rising into the air and the billows can be seen from all over Istanbul, which indicates the severity of the inferno. Several fire engines and ambulances are rushing to the scene even as aircraft overhead try to douse the fire in an attempt to prevent it from spreading to a hotel nearby. The airport, incidentally, is located very close to a military hangar.Fire ravaged several businesses in Montreal, Canada on Monday evening, despite the efforts of over 150 firefighters to extinguish the flames.

Fire authorities were forced to close Shiloh Road, a busy street which runs adjacent to the complex, for several hours while multiple city units  fought to douse the blaze. Eye witnesses report that screams of animals and people were heard. A local news source described the blaze as "massive", adding that while no-one was injured during the blaze, one cat was killed. One witness told a local news agency: "It engulfed it pretty quick. It's amazing to see how quick a fire can go like that. It just started on one end and took over."8 apartment units were reportedly totally destroyed in the incident. Initial reports indicate that the fire started in an upstairs apartment and spread rapidly. Local medical personnel were alerted to expect a large number of casualties. A woman, who lives in the neighboring apartment complex and was present during much of the event, spoke to Wikinews on the condition of anonymity. "It was unbelievable," she said. "There were firetrucks and police cars everywhere. It was the biggest fire I've ever seen."Fire officials have stated that they believe the cause of the fire may have been faulty wiring, adding that there was no evidence to suggest arson. On Thursday morning, local news outlet KLTV reported that many residents of the complex praised the fast and aggressive response of local firefighters. 61-year-old Cecile Hughston said that she was in her home about one block from the fire when she saw the flames. She said: "I was inside my house and I could see the flames, they were stretching up toward the sky. I was terrified." Multiple clean-up workers were present at the complex on Thursday morning and the damaged building was cordoned off with police tape.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a major moment magnitude 6.3 earthquake has struck Central Italy at 3:32 a.m. local time with a 4.8 aftershock about an hour after.

At least nine aftershocks, with the highest being a magnitude 4.8, have shaken the area since the initial earthquake.At least 150 people have been killed in the region and officials say the death toll is likely to rise. According to the RAI (Italian public broadcasting service) and press agencies, at least 1,500 people have been injured. No less than six people, four children, and an elderly woman, are reported to have been killed in a building collapse in L'Aquila, where most of the shaking was felt and at least six students are trapped beneath the rubble of a partially collapsed college dormitory. The USGS says nearly 70,000 people live in L'Aquila, with hundreds of thousands more people residing in the surrounding areas. Several buildings are reported to be collapsed or damaged in the city, including a church and school. The BBC reports the area as "hard hit." BNOnews reports that there are thousands of buildings damaged or collapsed in the region. Reports say as many as 50,000 houses and buildings have been destroyed, leaving thousands of people homeless. The mayor of L'Aquila, Massimo Cialente, declared that Onna fraction, a small conglomerate of houses near the capital of Abruzzo, was completely destroyed.Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has declared a state of emergency for the region, and is returning to Italy to coordinate the relief operations. The Minister of the Interior, Roberto Maroni, is also travelling to L'Aquila to offer collaboration from the government. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman contacted Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini to offer the assistance of Israel's natural disaster SAR teams.This is the deadliest quake in Italy since November 23, 1980, when nearly 3,000 people were killed in a magnitude 6.8 earthquake that struck Southern Italy in the Irpinia region. At least 10,000 were injured with over 300,000 being left homeless.This month is set to be one of the coldest ever recorded in the United Kingdom, as snow leads to millions of people's travel plans disrupted. One person at London Heathrow Airport said the grounding of aircraft, and disruption to rail services, had created "the Christmas from hell." On one of the busiest weekends for travellers of the year, Heathrow and Gatwick Airports closed their runways and roads countrywide became impassable.One person has already died this weekend after the ambulance he was being treated in crashed in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Meterologists warn that the conditions are unlikely to recede soon, adding that this month is set to be one of the coldest on record. Britain is not alone in Europe; airports in Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands are similarly affected.Wikinews today reports from the village of Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire, England, where villagers were buying essentials from the local supermarket, and roads were covered in six inches of snow. Wikinews journalist Paul Wace reported that councillors pledged to grit major routes, but the main road through the village was covered in a slushy mix of snow and grit, making travel extremely difficult.A fast, but potent, snowstorm passing through the United States state of Colorado dropped more than a foot of snow and caused a 35-car pile-up on one of the U.S.'s major highways, Interstate 70. The collision happened Saturday morning when white-out conditions, caused by 68 MPH sustained winds, hit the area. Despite the pileup, officials report that there were no major injuries. Interstate 70 was closed in both directions on Saturday, on a route from Denver to the Kansas state border, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. The storm also forced the closure of 125 miles of highway on Interstate 80. A blizzard warning remained in effect for parts of Kansas and Nebraska.A major winter storm, which has been nicknamed by some as "Snowmageddon", has pummeled parts of the U.S. Middle Atlantic region, dumping up to 19 inches (50 centimeters) of snow in some parts of the Washington area. The National Weather Service is predicting as much as 24 to 30 inches (60 to 75 cm) of snow for the Washington, D.C. region by late Saturday. The storm brought high winds and low visibility, with winds gusting at 56 miles per hour (93 kilometers per hour) along the coast.Life in the nation's capital ground to a halt with the federal government and most businesses closing early on Friday and residents warned to stay off the snow-clogged roads. Hundreds of thousands of homes were without power as the wet snow weighed heavily on trees and power lines. Power lines in some areas have been brought down by the heavy snow. The Weather Service issued blizzard and winter storm warnings for states reaching from Virginia and West Virginia up to Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey.Forecasters say this could be the largest recorded snowfall in Washington, rivaling a storm, known as the Knickerbocker Storm, that hit the city nearly 90 years ago, in January 1922.  The largest amount of snowfall recorded so far has been in Elkridge, Maryland, reporting 32 inches (81 cm).  The 1922 storm was named the Knickerbocker Storm for a theater where 98 people were killed when the building's roof collapsed due to heavy snow.  Snowfall in that storm measured 28 inches (71 cm).Airlines and airports across the region have canceled flights and train service has been disrupted.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, known as the Metro locally, has suspended bus service and above ground train service.  Underground subway service is running at 30 minute intervals.As the storm approached, residents emptied supermarket shelves, stocking up on food and other supplies, especially due to Super Bowl XLIV  which will be held on Sunday. Local area sports teams in Washington, D.C. will still play games as scheduled. People are urged to take the Metro to see the games and not use the roads. Impromptu snowball fights have also broken with some people going as far as to organize them over Facebook and Twitter.The winter weather has already been blamed for hundreds of road accidents. So far two fatalities have been reported, a father and son who were rendering aid to a stranded motorist on Interstate 81 in Virginia, when an approaching tractor-trailer jackknifed and killed the pair.This is the second major snowstorm to hit the region in less than two months.A major storm system has swept through Spain, Portugal, and France over the weekend, killing more than 50 people, and leaving nearly a million without power.The storm system, named Xynthia, has moved from Portugal north through Spain and coastal France, and is expected to reach northern Europe, including Denmark, by Sunday evening.  According the French Interior Ministry, at least 47 people have been killed in France alone, with around 60 injured.  Additionally, five are dead in Germany, three are dead in Spain, and one dead in each of Portugal, Belgium, and England.  French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux said that the death toll would likely rise, with around 30 people still missing.According to the French utility EDF, nearly a million homes in France are without power, largely around Brittany and central France.  Full restoration of power is not expected until Wednesday. Several towns on the French coast have been flooded, with more than a meter of water on the streets in some areas.  The storm produced winds upward of 100 mph and waves up to 26 feet high. Effects of the storm reached inland to Paris, where nearly 100 flights were canceled and a terminal of Charles de Gaulle Airport was severely damaged.  Rail transport was also affected, with tracks flooded in both Spain and France.In the United Kingdom, flood warnings have been issued for most of Britain, and warnings for severe flooding that was possibly life-threatening were issued for parts of Cambridgeshire.  In London, barriers on the Thames River were raised in order to reduce the potential for flooding.  The storm was expected to affect southern regions of the country as it moved northeast towards Scandinavia. In a statement, French president Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his condolences to those affected, and sent France's interior minister to the areas most affected to co-ordinate a response.  According to Prime Minister Fillon, the storms were a "national catastrophe." On Monday, the French government officially declared the storms a national disaster, which will allow funds to be released to help affected areas rebuild.The BBC and CNN has reported that a train derailment Saturday morning at about 4:15 a.m. local time (Friday 2245 UTC) has resulted in at least 100 casualties in the state of Andhra Pradesh in Southern India. Heavy rains, which killed over one hundred people in India this week, apparently washed out a section of track. A rescue operation is ongoing as some train carriages overturned into the flood waters and some people are apparently trapped. The BBC reports that many of the passengers were traveling to celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights, which occurs Tuesday.India operated rail systems carry more than 13 million passengers a day, but has a poor history of safety. The BBC says that about 300 rail accidents are reported each year, resulting in significant casualties.Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a Boeing 777, was shot down by a surface-to-air missile on Thursday according to US officials, over disputed eastern Ukraine by an unidentified party.The flight, which departed Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in The Netherlands at 10:15 UTC en route to Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, disappeared from radar at 13:15 UTC near Hrabove, a village in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine. 283 passengers and 15 crew were aboard the aircraft, all 298 in total perished. The area the plane was flying over is a conflict zone currently between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatist forces.  United States officials confirmed the aircraft has been shot down, according to data from a surveillance satellite which showed the last trajectory and impact of the missile. The missile is believed to be a Buk M1 surface-to-air missile which are believed to be in the hands of rebels according to reports from the area. So far no party has claimed responsibility for the attack. Ukrainian officials denied the missile which shot down the airliner belonged to Ukraine. Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's foreign minister, said to The Guardian, "We are absolutely sure and we checked yesterday that no missiles have been taken from the Ukrainian army". The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) published on YouTube an alleged wiretap of separatist commanders and Russian intelligence officers discussing the shoot-down and acknowledging the aircraft shot down was civilian.Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry has denied involvement, posting a statement on their website which read, "In view of various types of speculation concerning operations of the Russian armed forces in the areas bordering Ukraine, we affirm that the anti-aircraft means of the Russian armed forces did not operate in that region July 17".Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said, "This was not an 'incident', this was not a 'catastrophe', this was a terrorist act". Malyasian prime minister Najib Razak, said, "If it transpires that the flight was shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice."All civilian aircraft have been barred from flying over eastern Ukraine.  The US's Federal Aviation Adminstration issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) prohibiting flight operations by United States carriers over eastern Ukraine. However, questions remain as to why the aircraft was flying over the contested area. Eurocontrol noted airspace was closed up to 32,000 feet. Flight 17 was flying at 33,000 feet just above the restricted airspace. Malaysia Airlines issued a statement saying "The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). [The] International Air Transportation Association (IATA) has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions."Malaysian officials stated Wednesday, some of the debris found in the Maldives will be brought back to Malaysia to determine if they are from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370) as they now believe. A team arrived Tuesday in Maldives to take charge of the debris, which had previously been disposed of as trash."We [Malaysia] have an understanding with the authorities there [Maldives] ...we think the parts which were found about a month ago were parts of the aircraft," said Ab Aziz Kaprawi, the deputy transport minister for Malaysia as quoted by Bernama, a Malaysian government news agency. "They have to be further analysed and will be brought back to Malaysia for verification," he added."The parts are currently undergoing few processes before they can be released and brought to Malaysia for further identification and verification," said Seri Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia's transport minister during a press conference today. "If it belongs to Boeing 777 then we will have to carry out further analysis and verification," he added. Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation will be in charge of examining the debris once it arrives in the country.The debris washed ashore the Kaafu Atoll reportedly around May 31 and was recovered by employees of the Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru Resort. However the debris had been disposed of as trash before authorities could examine it. An investigation into the debris was launched after photos of it were uploaded to the social networking service Facebook, by an employee of the resort. The photographs show a large white object, possibly two, stained with algae and appear to be made of a fiberglass and honeycomb material. Debris has since washed ashore on at least three other Maldives locations, the Baa Atoll, and the islands of Fehendhoo and Fulhahdhoo, but most of it isn't believed to be from an aircraft. Abdulla Rasheed, a captain of a cargo boat which recently capsized in the waters off the Maldives stated, "From the pictures of the debris found on most of the islands, I can almost certainly say that they are from the cargo we were carrying." Despite this possibility, any debris located is being gathered up until Malaysian authorities can examine it."We are collecting any unidentified debris and storing them in a warehouse so that the Malaysians can carry out tests and determine if it is from their plane or not," said the office of the Maldives President in a statement reported by Haveeru Daily on Monday.MH370, while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, China, vanished on March 8, 2014. All 239 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. On the day the plane went missing, residents on the small Maldives island of Kudahuvadhoo claimed to have seen a very "low flying jumbo jet" crash into the Indian Ocean. Some also noted the colors appeared to resemble that of a Malaysia Airlines plane. "I’ve never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly", one resident was quoted as saying to the newspaper Haveeru Daily. Some claim the plane appeared to be headed in the direction of Diego Garcia, but Malaysian authorities have discounted those claims."Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of Flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country [Maldives]. Furthermore, the data of radars at Maldives airports have also been analysed and shows no indication of the said flight," said Malaysia's transport ministry at the time of the report.After published reports stated suspected plane debris washed up on several Maldives islands, Malaysia has stated it will send a team of investigators to examine it. Investigators are to try to determine if the debris came from a plane before taking any further action. "I urge all parties to allow for the verification process to take its due course. Once it is determined to be aircraft debris, discussions will be held to determine next steps in terms of the process of analysis. Undue speculation will only stress the families and loved ones, anxiously awaiting news on this matter," said Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia's Transport Minister in a statement.An investigation into the debris was launched after an photos of the debris were uploaded to the social networking website Facebook on, reportedly, May 31, by an employee of a beach resort. Some of the debris is reported to have washed ashore as early as May 31 and was found on a beach owned by the Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru resort, located in Kaafu Atoll. In the past few days, several other pieces of debris were recovered on at least three other islands. Authorities are trying to determine if it may be part of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370). Last week, a piece of a wing known as a flaperon was found washed ashore on Réunion Island. The Malaysian government stated it's from MH370, but according to Chinese officials, the piece has yet to be confirmed to be from MH370 because managers were on leave from the Spanish manufacturer of the part.However, before most of the debris could be examined, it had already been taken away for disposal. The photographs showed a large white object, possibly two, stained with algae and appear to be made of a fiberglass and honeycomb material. The objects appear to be several feet in length and width and in one photo where the paint is severely peeled, red letters "IC" can be seen.  Those pieces, along with others, were taken away and disposed of as trash. When authorities discovered the photographs, they returned to the site, but only found a small, five to seven inch (about 13–18 cm) piece of debris they say doesn't appear to be part of a plane.Some of the debris may not be from a plane. Abdulla Rasheed, a captain of a cargo boat which recently capsized in the waters off the Maldives, stated, "From the pictures of the debris found on most of the islands, I can almost certainly say that they are from the cargo we were carrying".

They are not related to MH370 and not even plane material," said Seri Liow, Malaysia's transport minister during a press conference today. He also stated investigators were still examining debris and if any of it was suspected of being from MH370, it would be taken for further analysis in Malaysia.On Tuesday, the team of Malaysian investigators arrived in Maldives to take charge of the debris, which washed ashore on Vabbinfaru on May 31 and had been disposed of as trash.

Forty one year-old Nerhus said he was diving near the shore in murky waters, when the shark grabbed him by the head, crushing his diving mask. Nerhus fought back, poking the shark's eye socket with his fingers. The shark released him but came back again, grabbing Nerhus by his upper body, leaving deep lacerations on his torso. Nerhus managed to free one arm and stabbed the shark with a chisel. When the shark released him again, he made for the surface, where he was pulled out of the water by his 25-year-old son and was rushed to hospital. He is being treated for serious injuries to his head, body and left arm and is expected to remain in hospital for a few more days. He was able to recount his experience to reporters. Nerhus believes that the shark may have mistaken his black wetsuit and flipper clad figure for a seal, prompting the attack. Grant Willis, a shark expert at Sydney Aquarium agreed with the assessment, speaking to CNN. An average of about 15 shark attacks occur in Australia every year, of which one is fatal. This is one of the highest shark attack rates in the world.Thomas Charles Damron, aged 22, was charged in the death of 18 year old Kathryn Sutherland, killed Saturday afternoon in a four-car crash Saturday afternoon near Romeo, Michigan.Damron, arraigned Monday afternoon, was charged with operating a vehicle with the presence of drugs causing death, possession of marijuana, and negligent homicide.

According to authorities, the only reason why the man is alive is because he landed on top of a woman who had fallen down the same shaft just one day earlier.27-year-old Jens Wilhelms, who was not injured in the fall, was walking up a dark stairwell, passing by the elevator shaft which was undergoing repairs. When he peeked inside the open doors to see what was going on, he slipped off the edge."I saw the door open and I just wanted to check whether somebody was finally working on the elevator. I took a closer look inside the shaft as it was pitch black, and must have slipped off the edge somehow," said Wilhelms to the media.Approximately 24 hours prior to Wilhelms' fall, an unidentified 57-year-old woman fell down the same shaft and was laying unconscious on the shaft's floor, bleeding internally.Authorities say that although the woman sustained additional injuries from Wilhelms' fall, he likely saved her life."When Wilhelms fell down on her his weight caused additional damage to her body, but without that she could have laid there for days. The woman had been lying unconscious in the shaft for some time already," said Manfred Vonhausen, a spokesman for the Frankfurt Police Department.The woman remains in a hospital where she is in critical condition.A 21 year old man fell into a tank of chocolate and was stuck waist deep in it for two hours on August 18 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.Darmin Garcia, an employee of a company that supplies chocolate ingredients, said he was pushing the chocolate down into the container because it was stuck but it became loose and he fell in.

Police spokesperson Petra Sjölander said "One explosion happened at the intersection of Drottninggatan and Olof Palmes Gata," At least 2 people were treated for minor injuries from the first explosion. There are conflicting accounts concerning cause.A second explosion followed at the intersection Drottninggatan and Bryggargatan according to the same spokesperson, who called this 'suspicious' - "We don't know at this point what caused the second explosion, we had bomb technicians on site, but I can't give you any details of what they did."The body of a male was found close to the site of the second incident, although any relationship to either incident is still unclear. "I can't confirm that the death is linked to the car explosion, but I can't rule it out either" Sjölander stated. An eyewitness to the second explosion, Gabriel Gabiro, was reported as saying "There was a man lying on the ground with blood coming out in the area of his belly, and with his personal belongings scattered around him."The cause of both blasts is under investigation, police spokesperson Ulf Johansson saying 'We need more investigation and of course we need more witnesses to give us the information of what actually has happened'. He also claimed that there had been no warnings.Despite statements from police, some news sources are raising the possibility of a terrorist link after apparent warnings were sent to Swedish news agency TT. The warnings are reported to have contained references to Swedish involvement in Afghanistan and to the controversial Lars Vilks Muhammad cartoons.A man has been admitted to hospital, having been  seriously injured when hit by a car in Glasgow, Scotland. The accident took place at approximately 0345 UTC on Sunday morning. The  30-year-old victim was run over by a Vauxhall car in the vicinity of John Knox Street and Wishart Street in the east end of the city.The pedestrian was transferred to the Southern General Hospital after initially being transported to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The condition of the passenger, who experienced a serious head injury, was described as serious albeit stable by hospital staff. The 48-year-old driver, who alerted emergency services to the incident, was uninjured but apparently shaken.Sergeant Jo McPherson of Police Scotland said of the area in which the accident occurred: "Despite it being in the early hours of the morning this route can often be busy with taxis and cars as people make their way out of the city centre." Appealing to potential witnesses for information, Sergeant McPherson said: "The area is also overlooked by residential flats and it's possible someone may have witnessed the crash from their flat."A man has been killed after a car accident in Cornwall, England. The collision involved a vehicle driving off a quay in Porthleven, near the town of Helston in the county and into the sea at around 2100 Greenwich Mean Time on Friday, according to reports from members of the public made to the police and the coastguard.A major rescue operation was launched with contributions from the harbourmaster, the ambulance service, the police, the fire crews, a helicopter and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. After roughly two hours, a harbour crane lifted the vehicle out of the water that it had crashed into. It transpired that the man was the only occupant of the vehicle. It is believed that no other vehicles were involved in the incident. The man was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, which is situated in Truro, by ambulance. However, on arrival, he was pronounced dead.Now tributes are being paid to 20-year-old Jamie Hocking after his death. The family of the man have said that he will be "truly missed by all who knew him", describing Jamie with the words "loveable rogue". The family also expressed their thanks to people offering sympathy messages and support from others, as well as the emergency services who assisted at the scene of the accident. Devon and Cornwall Constabulary are now asking any people who know of any information relating to the incident to contact them as soon as possible.A man was shot and killed by police officers in East New York, Brooklyn, New York who were responding to a 9-1-1 call reporting a home invasion late Thursday night. The deceased, 26-year-old Duane Browne, was carrying a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver. Police believe he was responding to armed men who had entered his home.According to police reconstruction of events, as Browne's brother, 31-year-old Dale Ogarro, approached the home on 943 Schenck Ave., he was accosted by two armed men who demanded "where's the money!" He was forced into the building's basement. His girlfriend in a nearby car called 9-1-1 five times to report the invasion. The robbers escaped as police approached. When police arrived, Ogarro reported he was unharmed but did not say the robbers had left or his brother was carrying a gun. Browne exited the house through a back door holding the revolver and police ordered him to drop it. When he failed to do so, police shot him.Police found 11 bags of cannabis and a scale in a basement closet. According to police, Ogarro has been arrested in the past on several drug charges, and the firearm he carried was unregistered.On December 12, 2011, police officer Peter J. Figoski was killed while responding to a burglary at a nearby home.Authorities have said that an anonymous phone call warning of a potential terrorist threat aboard an aircraft may have been a hoax call. Swedish police detained a passenger aboard a Boeing 777 on suspicion of preparing an attack on the aircraft, but he was later released. A police spokesperson said: "The man who was the suspect for the bomb case was released by the district attorney. They couldn't find any crime done, therefore [they] decided to release the man and he's free to go where he wants." A statement released by Swedish prosecutors confirmed that "the prosecutor on duty decided not to keep the man suspected of having explosives on the airplane in detention. The suspicions against this man are not sufficiently solid to keep him in detention and so he is free to leave Sweden. No further information can be given for [the] moment".The Pakistan International Airlines jetliner, which was carrying 273 people according to an airport spokesperson, was flying Flight 782, which travels from Toronto to Karachi, when it was diverted to Stockholm-Arlanda Airport in Stockholm after Canadian officials were informed that a passenger had explosives on his person. Passengers were reportedly informed that they had to divert for technical reasons, but were only told on the ground why they had to land in Stockholm. "The pilot only informed us that he's landing there due to security reasons. All passengers and crew members are well," a spokesperson for the airport said. Upon landing, the aircraft was evacuated, and the suspect was arrested by a SWAT team. Passengers were taken away from the aircraft, which was encircled by armed police, by buses. 35-year-old Irfan Ahmed, a passenger on the flight said: "We really got scared, especially when we saw a large number of commandos wearing masks coming in."Adelaide, Australia —A man is in Royal Adelaide Hospital in a critical condition after being run over by a train north of Adelaide today. The accident occurred at 1:30pm ACDT. The man has lost both his legs. Reports indicate that the man was a railway employee involved in shunting of train carriages.England's Greater Manchester Police yesterday appealed to the public for information to track down a man who stole a woman's purse after she was fatally injured by a lorry. Police were alerted to the collision between the truck and the 82-year-old woman, in the town of Leigh, at approximately 1145 UTC on Wednesday. The woman died at the scene, in what one nearby resident called "a horrible thing to have happened". Witnesses subsequently told police a man stole the victim's purse in the aftermath of the crash."This is one of the most disgusting crimes I have ever investigated and I find it hard to believe someone could stoop so low to commit such a horrific offence," said detective Sergeant Neil Lawless. "This man has taken what he sees as an easy opportunity by stealing a purse from a dying woman.  I am sure the community will be equally disgusted and I appeal to anyone who may have seen this man take the purse and walk off on Leigh Road. There are a number of rumours circulating on social media at the moment but I would like to reassure residents we are doing all we can to find out who is responsible." Meanwhile, website Wigan Today has claimed witnesses and an unnamed Greater Manchester Police source informed it some nearby pedestrians took pictures of her body following the crash, although the official police statement does not directly address these claims.Sergeant Lawless has asked members of the public to contact police with any information that may be relevant to the investigation. Greater Manchester Police describe the thief as white, of medium build, aged between 30 and 40, and six feet in height. The police force say he "had a dark brown beard, [and] wore a light grey hooded top with the hood pulled over his head, light blue jeans and black boot style training shoes."Evacuation alerts were issued to 850 Manitoba residents as they prepare for the worst flooding from the Red River.Dominion City declared a state of emergency on Monday regarding rising water levels. The area is already experiencing overland flooding. Southern Manitoba is under a winter storm warning which will worsen the situation with further precipitation. Besides working on dikes and sandbagging efforts, communities are breaking up ice jams and frozen culverts.  Ice jams have already caused the evacuation of 40 homes north of Winnipeg, and dozens of homes were flooded. A state of emergency was declared Wednesday for the rural municipalities (RM) of St. Andrews, St. Clements, East St. Paul, West St. Paul, Blanshard, St. Laurent and Franklin. Roads are being wiped out and basements flooded due to the overland flooding caused by frozen culverts and ice jams. The Red River Floodway was constructed to divert flowing waters from the river basin around the city and communities, however ice jams have caused the waters to flow over the river banks."The road is eventually going to get washed over so we want to get the elderly out for that reason," said Curtis Smith of the Manitoba Association of Native Fire Fighters. 95 have already been evacuated to Winnipeg from Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation.“All the plans are in the offing. It all depends on the elevation of the water, how fast it's going to approach. You need to do a phased evacuation so it's elderly and people with special needs first." said Don Brennan acting executive director of Manitoba's Emergency Measures Organization.Paul Guyader, Manitoba's emergency measures coordinator reported that residents are setting sandbags into place as fast as they can be made, however the height of flooding won't come for yet another week in southern Manitoba. Towns throughout the area are surrounded by ring dikes.During the week of April 5 to 10 is when the Red River is expected to crest around Emerson, Manitoba. Emerson is located on the east banks of the Red River near the Canada – United States border.The river should reach its maximum during the week of April 12 to 17 in the region around Winnipeg."We don't want to be in a scramble this time, because one of the problems that we had last time [in 1997] was making sure that everyone understood who was in charge," said Chief Terry Nelson of the Roseau River First Nation. "Last time, the people, we weren't too much involved in what the authorities were doing."The United States National Weather Service recorded levels at 11.6 metres (38 feet) on Thursday, and the predictions are that it should reach 12.5 metres (41 ft) by the weekend. Mayor Dennis Walaker of Fargo, North Dakota has put into place contingency plans. The Red River's recorded highest cresting at Fargo was in 1897 when it reach 12.2 metres (40 ft). The Flood of the Century in 1997 crested at 16.5 metres (54 ft) at Grand Forks, North Dakota. Manitoba officials feel that this year flooding should not be as bad as the 1997 flood."Mother Nature will decide when she's going to crack this baby loose", said Steve Strang, mayor of the RM of St. Clements, Manitoba.Over 1,600 volunteers registered to help build approximately 65,000 of the 500,000 sandbags to create dikes 20.5 feet (6.2 meters) high to protect the City of Winnipeg, Manitoba in the war against the Red River of the North flood.700 volunteers answered at the rural municipality of St. Andrews alone. Once sandbags are filled for West St. Paul, St. Andrews, and Selkirk, then frozen culverts must be cleared.The height of the river is expected to be Thursday, and predictions are that it will be less than Flood of the Century of 1997. There is no precipitation in the forecast, and snow in the province should be melted by the end of the week."The fear right now is we have to get that ice out of the river. The Amphibex [Excavators] are still working and breaking the ice apart, and everyday we buy with the warm weather and the current, it is thinning the ice down a bit, so when it does start to move, the better chance it'll move right out into the lake," said Paul Guyder, the emergency coordinator for the RMs of St. Andrews and St. Clements."I feel that we've done everything humanly possible to get ready," said Gary Doer, Premier of Manitoba, "But ... there are fallibilities with human behaviour. We can take every preventative measure as human beings possible and we can still get Mother Nature proving again she is superior."Communities with ring diking will partially or fully close their dikes at the beginning of the week. Provincial officials are considering opening the Red River Floodway gates around mid-week before ice is fully melted.Ice jams could cause flooding within the city, however opening the gates could spare neighbourhood flooding when the river rises to the estimated 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) height. The province does have back up plans for dealing with ice jams within the city if they do occur. The unpredictability of ice jams and the ensuing water level rise may cause neighbourhood flooding. The city is raising dikes where the river has jammed with ice in the past such as on tight curves and past bridges.  Likewise there are excavators and backhoes positioned at these points.Vulnerable neighbourhoods on the river banks have been reinforced with sandbag dikes at vulnerable areas from the massive volunteer effort over the weekend. Guyader feels no more extra volunteers are needed, however volunteers are still being asked to leave their names and number in case of unpredicted need. Existing personnel will assess roads, and help with clean up. Approximately 400 of the 800 people who evacuated the Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation have returned to their homes.Former Premier, Dufferin Roblin, brought forward the floodway as a protection for Winnipeg residents and economy following the 1950 Red River Flood. The Red River floodway, "Duff's Ditch" was finally finished in 1968, and its floodway gates have been opened 20 times saving Winnipeg from an estimated CA$10 billion in damages. The floodway expansion began in 2005 at a price of $665 million.Polish and Chinese experts have come to survey the Red River Floodway, and Dennis Walaker, mayor of Fargo, North Dakota  recognises the need for Red River flood defences down river. "Every town that you drive by from the Canadian line up to Winnipeg is either elevated or ring-diked," said Walaker.The Red River at Winnipeg is almost clear of ice blocks and ice jamming, however there are still dangers from the Red River flood.Ice blocks which were as high as two storey buildings were ripping out trees, fences and railway ties. "You'll see huge pans of ice standing vertical, up to 20 feet (6.1 m) high," said Steve Topping, an official with the provincial Water Stewardship Department. "Ice was shoved up on the shore and took out trees with a very devastating effect. It has changed people's view of the river."  "It is incredible, the force. One piece of ice pushed out of the river about 20 feet. You watch the force push this up right in front of your eyes," said Dean North, of the Selkirk Golf and Country Club. Royal Canadian Mounted Police are ticketing sight seers who are driving through road closure signs and approaching excavators, cranes and crews breaking up the ice. Vehicles, people, boats, and kayaks are getting in the way. An eight year old boy is in critical condition after slipping on a culvert Thursday. He was pulled underwater by the speed of the flowing water and remained under for about five to ten minutes until adults could rescue him. The air ambulance supplied by Alberta's STARS (Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society) remains in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba."This is not a spectator sport. It's not about getting the best pictures for the family albums. I know floods are seen as a bit of an event, but some of the instances I'm hearing about, people should give their head a shake, they really should,"  said Steve Ashton Manitoba Emergency Measures Minister, "Those who fall into the river or get into trouble in another way would be not only endangering themselves but the emergency response crews trying to rescue them. I don't want to see a situation … where we're trying our darndest to prevent flooding and save lives and somebody [who] decides to go have a white-water experience ends up killing themselves."Early Easter Sunday morning floodwater reached the rural municipalities of St. Andrews and St. Clements north of Winnipeg. Residents were sent an evacuation advisory Good Friday, however some residents remained. Rescue efforts commenced Saturday night to find those stranded and unable to leave as their vehicles cannot travel in the swollen overland floodwaters. Some people were rescued from roof tops as entire houses were swept off of their foundations by the large ice blocks hurtling down the river.Highways in the area remain closed. Neil Gobelle, of Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation said to "definitely continue to watch the Red River Valley and north of the city up in the Selkirk area. Things are changing quite a bit, quite quickly, so we'll keep an eye on those areas." As of Easter Sunday, Winnipeg is expected to be ice free on the Red River. The River rose 4 feet (1.2 m) in the course of 24 hours. Rain is in the forecast and the higher temperatures of 17 °C (62.6 °F) will cause melting of snow and ice.A weather system caused by La Niña is being watched by the United States National Weather Service and its potential effects between April 16-18 for residents along the Red River Valley. "We want people to be aware there is a very real possibility of the river going higher than what is out there," said Mark Ewens, data manager at the NWS, "To have spring floods like this back-to-back is just an unfortunate series of events that have come along to plague us this spring. We're wanting people to understand that this is a potentially serious problem."A train crash in India at around 0200 local time Monday (2030 UTC on Sunday) has killed at least 40 people and injured at least another 100. The crash occurred in the town of Sainthia, which is located in eastern India.  Initial reports say that one passenger train collided with another that was waiting at a station, but the exact cause is not known.The lowest estimate of the death toll is around 40 dead, and Indian media has reported that there are as many as 100 dead and 150 people injured. The incident has prompted a major rescue operation, and senior government officials are en route to the site of the incident.The region's Superintendent of Police, Humayun Kabir, said that "[c]asualties have taken place. I cannot give any number now. Rescue work has begun."  A local railroad official said that "[t]he people who have lost their lives were travelling in unreserved coaches.  We do not have their names and any vital information about them to inform their relatives." The state-run Indian railway system has a poor safety record, with several hundred incidents a year taking place, and this crash is the third major one in the past decade.Investigations are continuing at Alton Towers after a total of 29 people were injured on a roller-coaster.  Six people were taken to hospital after the accident at the UK’s most famous theme park. The front carriages of the Runaway Mine Train, which had 46 passengers on it at the time, became separated and subsequently crashed back into the rest of the ride at the Staffordshire theme park. A Staffordshire Ambulance spokesman said two women, aged in their 30s or 40s, were flown by air ambulance to North Staffordshire Hospital suffering possible whiplash, spinal or abdominal injuries. A third woman was taken by land ambulance to the same hospital and a man is thought to have made his own way to a casualties centre in Leek. Two other people were taken to Accident and Emergency later, and the other people who were injured were treated for cuts and bruises on the premises. The ride, which opened in 1990 and is one of Alton Towers oldest attractions, was immediately evacuated and closed to the public. Alton Towers and the Health and Safety Executive are investigating the incident which occurred at 11:00am local time on Thursday. A spokeswoman for the theme park announced that “the ride has been closed and will remain so whilst a thorough investigation is carried out”. It is unclear how long the ride will be closed for, but the rest of the theme park will stay open.On the Alton Towers website, customers are told the Runaway Mine Train lets them “rattle along the rickety rails and mine shafts, past trees and rivers, on a speeding locomotive that’s out of control - and getting faster every second” .The roller coaster was manufactured by Mack Rides, and is situated in the Katanga Canyon area of the theme park. The train normally makes two circuits for each ride, but on quiet days, it has been known to make three.Citizens across Texas were still dealing with the effects of hurricane Harvey, days after the storm made landfall on Friday.A meteorologist for CNN called the storm a "one-in-1,000-years-type of event." Media sources today stated the storm will still continue to wind its way across the state for the next four to five days. Houston's mayor told sources, "This is a storm that is testing the city of Houston." University of Texas officials cancelled all classes at their Houston Engineering Center for this week. Public health officials north of the hurricane's path began planning to deploy social workers and other staff to the storm's area if needed.The storm was classified as a Category 3 hurricane as it approached the state's coast. Late Friday evening, as the storm pressed close to Texas, it was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane. Many locals decided to shelter in place and ride out the storm. The National Weather Service predicts roughly 27 inches of additional rain will fall over Houston during the next few days.Tornadoes have been reported across the southern United States, with some sources saying as many as 48 have died. The NOAA have reported that several buildings have been damaged in the tornadoes, including a hospital in Arkansas. At least 69 tornadoes have been reported to have taken place in the last two days, most of which took place on the same day as US citizens were voting in caucuses and primaries on a day known as super Tuesday.Over twenty five nations have offered aid in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.  In particular, France has offered the use of its resources in the Caribbean sea, including 2 navy ships, 1 navy hospital, 8 planes, 600 tents, 1000 beds, and rescuers.  President George W. Bush has refused such material aid to the hurricane's victims, although cash donations will be accepted.  He explained his reasons to ABC News:I'm not expecting much from foreign nations because we hadn't asked for it. I do expect a lot of sympathy and perhaps some will send cash dollars. But this country's going to rise up and take care of it. You know, we would love help, but we're going to take care of our own business as well, and there's no doubt in my mind we'll succeed. And there's no doubt in my mind, as I sit here talking to you, that New Orleans is going to rise up again as a great city.A few of these nations, such as Venezuela and Cuba, are disliked by the administration, but the majority are considered allies of the United States.  Venezuela's Citgo Petroleum Corp. pledged a $1 million donation for hurricane aid.  Cuba refused U.S. aid following Hurricane Dennis.    In order to reduce the side effects of hurricane Katrina, Japan, Venezuela, and most EU countries offer to provide oil reserves to the U.S.A boat travelling in rough seas capsized off the coast of Christmas Island early this morning. Inside the boat were approximately 70 asylum seekers from Iran and Iraq, many now of which are feared dead. Reports from Government sources indicate that 41 of the 75 asylum seekers were rescued. So far only 27 bodies have been recovered from the water, but authorities believe the death toll could rise to 50. The remainder of people were not accounted for. The incident is believed to have occurred at about 6:00am. Residents of Christmas Island first attended the scene to assist in the rescue attempt. The residents rushed to the boat after hearing screams very early in the morning. They then went out and attempted to assist. Customs are believed to be attending the scene currently. Life jackets have been provided, but not every person on the boat has received one. Rough seas hampered rescue attempts. The boat, according to witnesses was upturned and surrounded by large quantities of debris after being smashed against rocks. It is located in the vicinity of Flying Fish Cove.  Gordon Thomson, president of the Christmas Island Shire stated that the incident was a "very bad situation". The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) expressed concern and sadness over the incident."We believe that far too many people are tragically losing their lives as they take desperate measures to escape conflict, persecution and poverty," said the UNHCR in a statement on its website.Christmas Island hosts an immigration center which is currently housing over 3,000 individuals seeking asylum.On Wednesday, it was raining rocks in Toronto. A 115 Kilogram marble panel fell 51 stories from the side of First Canadian Place, 100 King Street West, which is the heart of Toronto's Business district. The panel was one of many that were identified as a risk during an inspection.The rock fell onto a third story roof, where its fall was broken.There were no reports of injuries, but the event snarled traffic in Toronto, as many major roads were closed. It also backed up street car traffic along King Street. King St. W. from York St. E. to Bay St. is expected to be closed for several days. Traffic continues normally now along all other previously closed streets.As investigations continue, an expert has commented that there is no need for alarm. David Bowick, a professor of architecture at the University of Toronto, says such incidents are rare, given the improvements to architectural technology over the years. Several experts, Bowick included, have commented that the incident was probably caused by a major storm which occurred Tuesday night.Bowick added that natural materials like marble have inherent flaws which are susceptible to such destruction.According to the official website, First Canadian Place, constructed in 1975, is 2.8 million square ft., has 72 stories, and is still today Canada's tallest office building (tallest skyscraper) measuring 298 metres in height. It has 3-levels of over 120 offices, banks, restaurants, and stores.The World Health Organization (WHO) announced Wednesday that an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever, caused by Marburg virus, in Angola has claimed the lives of 311 Angolans.  The outburst can be traced back to October 2004.  The great majority of cases have originated in Uige Province.  WHO estimates that 75% of the cases have occurred in children under the age of 5 years old.From the WHO:'Marburg virus disease has no vaccine or curative treatment, and can be rapidly fatal. In the present outbreak, most deaths have occurred between 3 to 7 days following the onset of symptoms. Past outbreaks indicate that close contact with bodily fluids of infected people, as may occur in health care settings or during burial practices, increases the risk of infection.'This is the largest recorded outbreak of Marburg viral hemorrhagic fever in history.The risk to international travelers is low, according to the WHO, because the disease requires close personal contact to be transmitted.An F/A-18 jet belonging to the US Marines crashed today at the Miramar Air Station in San Diego, California.The pilot, who ejected safely, was found conscious and did not suffer major injuries said spokesperson for the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department, Maurice Luque. Luque also confirmed that the pilot was the only person aboard the plane. The plane crashed about three miles away from Miramar Airfield. The cause of the crash is currently being investigated by the US Marine Corps.An eyewitness to the event told local television station KUSI-TV that, "...it just pitched down and plummeted straight into the ground."An internal investigation by the United States Marine Corps into the crash of an F/A-18 jet into a San Diego house has blamed errors on the part of the pilot, his superiors and maintenance personnel for the accident which killed four people. The report found that mechanics had noticed the aircraft had a faulty fuel transfer system in June 2008 but repairs were never made, with the defective jet performing 146 more sorties in this state before the December accident."While we did not find any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, the responsible parties are being held accountable for their part in this tragic accident," said Maj. Gen. Randolph Alles of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. Four Marine squadron officers have been relieved of duty, as well as Navy officers. Eight enlisted Marines and one Navy sailor have been reprimanded. The pilot has been grounded.On the day of the accident the pilot, Lt. Dan Neubauer, had just taken off from the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln when he reported that the aircraft's right engine had low oil pressure.Neubauer, who was still in training, shut the engine down as a precaution, leaving the plane operating on the left engine. The Abraham Lincoln's captain and the 'air boss' suggested an emergency landing at the North Island military base, which was about 100 miles from the carrier. This would have given an approach from over the ocean.Neubauer contacted his squadron bosses and instead opted to try to land at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, which was 11 more miles away and involved a flight path over San Diego. Neubauer also failed to read his own emergency checklists, instead having sections read to him by his squadron representatives on the ground. The squadron representatives at Miramar were unaware of all the details of the situation on board and did not read out all the relevant sections.Officers at Miramar were informed of the fact that a warning light indicated the remaining engine was running low on fuel. However, they did not take heed in what was described by the report as a "critical mistake". In fact, the plane's tanks had plenty of fuel, but the engine trouble was caused by the faulty fuel flow system, which fed the left engine. Officers also failed to watch the plane's location properly. Upon final approach to Miramar, Neubauer thought, incorrectly, that he could not turn right, towards his inoperative engine. Instead, he conducted a long leftwards loop to line up. The maneuver took around ninety seconds to complete and starved the left engine of fuel, causing it to flameout. At this point the jet fell towards the ground and the pilot attempted to aim the aircraft for a canyon, where it could crash safely. However, the plane did not stay airborne and struck a house at an estimated 150 mph. It is thought that two more seconds would have been enough for the plane to reach the canyon.Instead, the crash killed four people inside the house; a grandmother, her daughter and her two granddaughters. The children's father, Dong Yun Yoon, was among those briefed on the publication of the report, alongside politicians in Washington and San Diego. The pilot safely ejected after holding on as long as possible, the report stating that a second or two more would have likely resulted in his death.The investigation has a number of implications. The fuel problem was not followed up on as it was not on a list of faults requiring immediate repair, but nonetheless 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing operations officer Col. John Rupp said keeping it in the air "was collectively poor judgment on the part of the squadron's maintenance department." The commanding officer, operations officer, aviation maintenance officer and operations duty officer have all been relieved of duty, while eight other marines and a sailor were reprimanded.Maintenance standards have been upgraded and emergency training enhanced as a result. Flight simulators are set to include a scenario based on the accident. Lt. Dan Neubauer has been grounded and it is up to the deputy commandant for aviation whether he will be allowed to return to the air. Immediately after the accident, all F/A-18s were grounded and inspected. The Marines issued a bulletin to all other operators of the aircraft worldwide to warn them of the circumstances.So far, the Marines and the United States Navy have identified 40 F/A-18 Hornets with the same problem. None of these have crashed.A man and his wife, aged 87 and 84, have died after a car hit them in North Ayrshire in Scotland. The couple, who have yet to be publicly identified, were walking across Greenock Road in the town of Largs when they were hit by a red Toyota at approximately 9:15am BST (0815 UTC) yesterday.An air ambulance reportedly attended the scene of the crash. The woman was taken to Southern General Hospital in Glasgow. She died several hours later. Her husband died at the crash site. The Toyota driver, a 34-year-old woman, was uninjured but as a precaution was taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital.Greenock Road was closed between Nelson Street and Brisbane Road following the incident but reopened around 4:00pm BST (1500 UTC) yesterday. A report about the incident is to be sent to the procurator fiscal. Police have appealed for potential witnesses to the accident to contact them.The Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, Pakistan was bombed today killing at least 60 people and injuring 120.The explosion, believed to be a car or truck bomb and heard 30 km (18 miles) away in Rawalpindi, occurred at 8 P.M. PDT (14:00 UTC), just hours after newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari addressed Parliament promising to destroy terrorism in the country.It is thought that more than a ton of explosives were used in the blast, which left a crater 30 feet deep and triggered a gas leak which sent the hotel up in flames. It is feared that the death toll may go much higher in what is one of the worst terror attacks in Pakistan's history.The Marriott is a popular place for foreigners to stay and a prominent enterprise in the city, despite a wave of violence the country suffers.The hotel had been victim of another attack in January 2007 where a security guard was killed and several people injured after the guard blocked a bomber from getting at the hotel, forcing him to detonate his explosives where he was.Ambulances rushed to the scene of today's explosion, where rescuers ferried away the dead. Dozens of vehicles were gutted by fire, nearby trees were knocked down, and windows shattered in buildings hundreds of metres away. Witnesses, including a security guard, described a large truck approaching the building immediately before the explosion.No-one has yet claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the main suspects are Pakistan Taleban who operate in the north-west of the country.The Marussia F1 team's test driver, Spaniard María de Villota, was taken to hospital by air ambulance today after a collision in testing at Duxford Aerodrome.At the end of her first installation run, the car she was driving had a low-speed collision with the loading ramp of the team's support truck. According to BBC Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, the car "suddenly accelerated" into the rear of the vehicle. The Marussia team released a statement an hour and a half after the accident, stating that she had been transferred to hospital, and a further statement would be issued once her condition had been assessed.A spokesman for the East of England ambulance service, Gary Sanderson, said de Villota had "[...] sustained life-threatening injuries and following treatment at the scene by paramedics, she has been taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital for further care." According to witnesses, she was motionless for about fifteen minutes as medical teams attended to her, but did move her hands before being taken away from the test track. Medical charity Magpas, whose volunteer paramedics attended the accident, reported she had sustained injuries to her head and face, and was in a 'stable condition' when she reached the hospital.Marussia reported her as conscious later in the afternoon: "Since Maria's arrival at the hospital at approximately 10.45am this morning, she has been receiving the best medical attention possible at the hospital, which is the region's major trauma centre. Maria is conscious and medical assessments are ongoing. The team will await the outcome of these assessments before providing further comment. The team's first priority at this time is Maria and her family."De Villota was announced as Marussia's test driver in March, having prior experience driving for Alan Docking Racing in Superleague Formula in Spain.Today, Zimbabwean officials informed the media that an Air Zimbabwe Boeing 767 aircraft carrying 250 people had crashed at Harare International Airport, before they announced the reports were false and the incident had in fact been a drill to simulate the occurrence of such an event. Initial reports suggested that a flight from London had crashed upon landing at the airport. However, Medical Rescue International later stated in a post on Facebook that no airplane had crashed and it had "joined up with other services to attend to a mock accident at Harare International Airport ... Good to keep the practising up." Those behind the staged accident had reportedly not told any other governmental departments, resulting in relatives inquiring with Air Zimbabwe as to what had happened. A senior figure for Air Zimbabwe stated that he was "concerned that this incident led to many, many calls to us. People were frightened. No actual plane was involved, but there was a scenario involving a Boeing 767 plane that had been hijacked and forced down at Harare airport."It was reported that Peter Chikumba, chief of Air Zimbabwe, had also not been informed that the exercise was to take place, and that the airline had set up an emergency helpdesk to liaise with the families of victims. Alan McGuinness, a correspondent for Sky News, stated, "journalists who arrived at the airport saw smoke rising from a runway and were then taken to a room where they were told to wait. David Chawota, the head of the Zimbabwe Civil Aviation Authority, said the media was duped to make the drill more realistic." Chawota stated, "telling the media was part of the exercise. We wanted to see how the media would react," he said. Chawota himself told BNO News that an airliner had crashed. Michael van Poppel, head of BNO News said that "while I first thought Chawota was just misinformed by others, although that would be odd since he is the CEO of the aviation authority, I was stunned to hear that he actually knew it was a drill and wanted to see the media's response ... This basically means he was lying to me when I spoke to him, but also to other reporters he spoke to ... I think it was absolutely irresponsible of this CEO and I can't imagine what the families of passengers travelling to Harare around that time must have gone through when they heard news reports that there had been an 'accident' at the airport."McGuinness reported, "Stuart Sprake, general manager of FX Logistics, works at Harare airport and believed the secrecy surrounding the drill will help emergency crews learn valuable lessons." Sprake told reporters "they (the crews) had to find their way through crowds and traffic ... training exercises should be ad hoc — the less people know about it the better."According to Pentagon officials, nearly 70 United States Air Force personnel and high ranking officials have been relieved from command and or duty after an incident on August 30 when a U.S. B-52H bomber plane flew from Minot Air Force Base located in North Dakota to Louisiana with six armed AGM-129 ACM nuclear missiles attached to its wings.Twelve unarmed missiles were supposed to be taken to Barksdale Air Force Base to be taken out of commission. Instead, live missiles were placed on the planes wings, along with six of the "dummy missiles," before it took off from Minot AFB.  The air force says that this was a "serious error" on the part of the military, and is launching a formal and ongoing investigation. So far, the investigation states that the missiles loaded onto the plane were supposed to be inspected by looking through a portal on each missile, where a code would determine whether or not the missile was armed or a dummy. The inspector who loaded the missiles onto the plane only looked under the wing where the armed missiles were located and the plane's navigator also failed to perform a proper inspection.The numbers on an out-dated piece of paper were also not checked prior to the missiles being loaded on the plane despite the fact that the air force already had a system which is supposed to track the missiles."[The incident is an] erosion of adherence to weapons-handling standards. In the countless times our dedicated airmen have transferred weapons in our nation's arsenal, nothing like this has ever occurred. This was an unacceptable error that resulted in an unprecedented string of procedural failures," said Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Major General Richard Newton who also said that the plane's crew did not know that the missiles were on board the plane.U.S. air force officials state that there was no threat of a nuclear explosion had the plane crashed, but that a radiation leak was possible.Officials said that they want to make sure they "hold ourselves accountable to the American people and want to ensure proper corrective action has been taken."At least four colonels and at least one lieutenant were suspended from duty. At least 66 other personnel were also relieved including Colonel Bruce Emig, the commander of the B-52 5th Bomb Wing team and two other members. Officials say that criminal charges have not yet been filed against anyone involved in the incident, but did not rule them out.The US state of Massachusetts is turning a portion of Camp Edwards, an active Cape Cod military base, into a "village" for 2,500 evacuees of Hurricane Katrina, as part of Operation Helping Hand.The temporary shelter on the Massachusetts Military Reservation will have a population the size of Truro, Massachusetts and will include an active mayor and a system of government that will be like a town council However, the shelter will face security demands different from the fifteen Cape towns because Cape Edwards is an active base used for training exercises. Security will be overseen by the Massachusetts National Guard, with help from the Massachusetts State Police and the County Sheriff's office. Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney stressed that he wanted to give it a comfortable, non-hostile atmosphere.Upon touching down at Otis Air National Guard Base, Massport officials will issue identification cards, create case files for them and ask the evacuees to provide personal information which will go into to a database to be shared with other states that are taking evacuees.The agencies that will be on hand are, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. These agencies will coordinate volunteers, who must commit themselves to five days of volunteer efforts, and they must be able to transport themselves to the camp. Romney has asked for donations from the community. Evacuees will be assigned housing by groups. There could be barracks for single men, another for single women, and then space for elderly and families with children. Visitors will not be allowed.The school superintendent for the township of Bourne, Ed LaFleur, will work on enrolling the children of evacuees into Cape Cod schools. Romney met yesterday with leaders of the Blake Churches Alliance who will make available chaplains and counselors for the evacuees.Romney spent Monday night asking for the State House to pass a $25 million emergency spending bill to pay the initial costs of the facility.The arrival time of the evacuees has been postponed, for unknown reasons.On the night of November 3rd a blackout in France left 5 million in the dark. The blackout, which started at about 10 P.M. local time (2100UTC), is said to have affected the French capital, Paris, and 15 other areas, including Rhône, Isère, Loire, Ain and Saône-et-Loire (Burgundy).As of early Sunday morning, about 5 million people are still without power, and the French power authority, Électricité de France, said that the failure had originated in Germany, which has also effected other European countries.The blackout was triggered due to a sudden drop in temperature, which over heated the power system. The French emergency services were so overloaded with calls that they were forced to ask that people not call.Air traffic around Paris was unaffected by the blackout.Massive blackouts occurred throughout the US state of Florida shortly after 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (18:00 UTC) on Tuesday afternoon. Out of the 4.4 million customers served by Florida Power & Light, Co. (FPL), about 680,000 residents were affected, with an additional two million-plus customers affected in other parts of the state. It is estimated that as many as four million customers throughout Florida were affected, with many different power companies losing control of their specific grids. Power outages were reported as far south as the Florida Keys, on the original FPL grid, and as far north as Orlando and Daytona Beach, nearly 300 miles (483 km) away on the Progress Energy grid. Most of Miami-Dade and parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties suffered the worst outages. FPL President Armando Olivera said that a disconnect switch failed at 1:08 p.m. at the automated substation west of Miami, and a piece of equipment that controls voltage caught fire about the same time. Neither failure by itself would have caused a widespread outage. The event at the utility's Flagami substation consequently led to the rolling blackouts. Originally the first failure was thought to have occurred at the utility's nuclear plant at Turkey Point. It is still unclear how failure at this site spread, but with power turning off at the main Turkey Point location, which serves all of south Florida, FPL's grid shut down as well. It contributed to a domino effect which ended up sapping energy from bordering grids all over Florida. Police reported several people were stuck in the elevators of high-rise buildings in downtown Miami and several hospitals were running on backup power, although no injuries or fatalities have been reported. The blackouts caused major traffic jams and a few accidents, but the original outage was contained shortly after it occurred. All customers affected had power restored to them by 6:30 p.m. (23:30 UTC).An 8.6 magnitude earthquake occurred off the Indonesian coast at 08:38:37 UTC today, causing a tsunami watch to be issued over the entire Indian Ocean.According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck at a point 308 miles (495 km) southwest of Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, located on the northern extremity of the country's Sumatra island, at a depth of 20.5 miles (33 km). Local media reports suggest that people in Sumatra fled from their homes and offices in fear. The 8.6 quake was followed by a quake measuring 8.2 on the Richter Scale.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) advised authorities to "take appropriate action", stating that they were not aware whether a tsunami had occurred yet. The earthquake, initially believed to be 8.9 on the Richter Scale was later revised to be an 8.7 and finally an 8.6 quake. In reaction to the earthquake, the Indonesian disaster management agency noted that power had been shut down in Aceh. Moreover, people were being warned by sirens of the danger and were going to higher ground. Agency spokesman Sutopo said: "The electricity is down, there are traffic jams to access higher ground. Sirens and Koran recitals from mosques are everywhere."In its report, the PWTC issued a tsunami watch for 28 countries, including, but not limited to Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, Myanmar, Thailand, Maldives, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Mauritius, Singapore, Bangladesh, miscellaneous Indian Ocean islands, Pakistan, Somalia, Oman, Iran, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa and Mozambique. They mentioned that "[e]arthquakes of this size have the potential to generate a widespread destructive tsunami that can affect coastlines across the entire Indian Ocean basin."The tsunami warnings were initially issued for Indonesia after the 8.6 earthquake and later issued for a further two hours after the 8.2 earthquake hit the Aceh province. The watch was lifted for Myanmar, Australia and Malaysia. Later, India too ended its tsunami watch, with a scientist at the Indian tsunami warning center noting that "the danger has passed".Earlier, the tremors were felt as far away as Bangkok in Thailand and south India, particularly in Bangalore and Chennai. According to locals, people left their buildings in Bangalore on feeling the tremors. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Service issued a red high-level warning for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The southeastern coasts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu were put on lower warnings. According to Sky News, people residing near the coast were asked to move away from the sea in India. The tremors there reached upto the northern city of Kolkata. Kolkata and its surrounding areas felt tremors, also felt in North 24 Parganas and the town of Siliguri in the same state. Several people rushed out of their office as windows and doors rattled due to the quake, while some buildings developed cracks. Metro Rail services were suspended in the city, and people were asked to leave the stations.Similar warnings were issued by the governments in Sri Lanka, where mild tremors were experienced at Colombo. The tsunami warning was however lifted after 6 p.m. local time. But the government advised people not to go close to the sea. Smith Dhamasoroja, of the National Disaster Warning Foundation, predicted that Thailand would have to face a tsunami as the earthquake was so powerful. Thai Meteorological Department deputy chief Somchai Baimoung however stated that no warning had yet been issued. Later a warning was issued in the country and subsequently lifted. In Bangladesh, two tremors were felt. But the authorities stated there was no fear of a tsunami.Amy Vaughn of the U.S. Geological Survey told Sky News that because the earthquake was so massive, "a large body of water is disturbed by the movement of the fault". Therefore, since the epicenter was so close to the west coast of Sumatra, "it could be devastating for the region." In Malaysia, high-rise buildings shook for over a minute.Indonesia straddles the Pacific Ring of Fire, a major earthquake belt. On December 26, 2004 a 9.2-magnitude earthquake in the same area triggered massive tsunami waves, killing almost 220,000 people.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a massive earthquake with a magnitude of 8.4 has struck Indonesia and a tsunami is reported to have been generated. Some smaller aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.2 and 5.7 were also reported in the region. At least four have been killed and dozens injured.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a tsunami warning saying that the quake had the potential to "generate a widespread destructive tsunami that can affect coastlines across the entire Indian Ocean.""Sea level readings indicate a tsunami was generated. It may have been destructive along some coasts.  Based on these data, the threat continues for all coastal areas of the Indian Ocean," said the NOAA tsunami warning.The earthquake was recorded at 6:10 p.m. (local time), 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Bengkulu, Sumatra, Indonesia with a depth of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) and the USGS states that damage could be "moderate to heavy." Reports say that buildings shook heavily in Jakarta and that the quake could be felt as far away as Singapore and Thailand.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a second massive earthquake, magnitude 7.8 struck Indonesia at 6:49 a.m. (local time) [23:49 (UTC)]. The epicenter of the earthquake was located 185 kilometers (115 miles) south, southeast of Padang, Sumatra, Indonesia with a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles). Just hours ago on September 12, a massive 8.4 quake struck in the same region killing six people and injuring hundreds.Several aftershocks have rocked the same area, the latest measuring 7.1, had a depth of 10 km. It was first reported to be a 7.3 aftershock.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had issued a tsunami warning saying that the quake had the potential to "generate a destructive local tsunami and sometimes regional destructive tsunamis along coasts located usually no more than a thousand kilometers from the earthquake epicenter," but it was later lifted because no tsunamis were generated. Australia was also included in the warning. An advisory was sent out for the 6.5 aftershock stating that there was "no widespread tsunami threat based on earthquake historical data."There is no word on injuries, deaths, or damage, but the USGS states that damage could be "moderate to heavy." The quake was felt in Singapore where buildings are reported to have shook.Multiple large explosions have been reported at Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases, a propane facility in northern Toronto near Keele Street and Wilson Street near the Highway 401, at approximately between 3:25 and 3:50 am EST, at Murray Rd. and Spalding Rd. A six-alarm fire continued to erupt from the explosion, now under control. The cause is currently unknown.A person who was 10km from the explosion told Wikinews that "my house shook 10 km away. The sky was rumbling every few seconds."Windows were blown out, doors were broken, and balls of fire descended from the sky near the explosion.A witness who was in Niagara-on-the-Lake at the time witnessed the entire skyline of Toronto lighting up; someone else in Aurora at the time saw and felt the explosion.A user on YouTube named "wolfshades" said that "we don't know whether the explosion was chemical or by virtue of its proximity to the Toronto Airport if a plane had crashed." Some witnesses thought the explosion was thunder or a nuclear bomb; the explosion was seen at Ossington Avenue and heard in Bloor and Jarvis in Toronto.At least eighteen injuries have been reported, with one person still unaccounted for. All of the injuries reported so far have been minor, although one man had a layer of skin burned off his back. A Toronto firefighter died near the scene from a non-traumatic cause, believed to be a heart attack while fighting a fire near Murray and Regent; efforts were made to revive him, but were unsuccessful.Large numbers of police are on the scene to keep people away from the explosion.There is concern that two large railcar-mounted propane tanks, each capable of carrying 220,000 litres, could explode with enough force to affect a 1.6km radius. The air was found not to be toxic at the site. Firefighters are working to cool the tanks down and keep flames away, reducing the risk of explosion. More than 12,000 people have been evacuated. Most evacuees were transported to Yorkdale Mall and York University.At the time of writing, evacuated residents have not yet been allowed to return to their homes. The 401, a major highway has been closed near the area; Eastbound 401 has been shut down between 400 and Allen Road, westbound shut down from 404/DVP to Highway 400. Three TTC subway stations: Yorkdale, Wilson, and Downsview were closed, but later re-opened. It was reported that Yorkdale Mall had been evacuated, but the Toronto Mayor David Miller confirmed through a teleconference from Vancouver that the report was false.Heavy June rainfall has forced China to  evacuate more than 550,000 people from their homes. Massive floods have devastated the central and  southern parts of the country,  causing rivers to overflow their banks and triggering mudslides.  The rains follow the worst drought in China in over 50 years, which has decimated  crop yields.  Overall, 40 rivers have risen above safe limits, stressing  dykes and dams including those on China's largest waterway, the Yangtze River, which is flooding downstream while experiencing a severe drought near its source in the north. China's disaster level has been raised to four, the highest on the scale. In a statement on its website on Friday, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs said, "Since June 13, the damage caused by the rainstorms has led to ... the emergency evacuation of 671,200 people to safety."The current round of heavy rains began in early June. Since then, more than a million and a half people have been displaced in  the central and southern regions of the country and at least 168 deaths have been reported. Meteorologists in Beijing are predicting more heavy rain in  Sichuan, Guizhou, and Zhejiang this weekend.The government has mobilized its forces to aid in the massive evacuations. According to Reuters, local authorities are distributing a box of instant noodles and a carton of bottled water to those affected by the flood. But villagers have reported that survival is difficult, especially for those still trapped by the flood waters in small villages, and distribution of aid is slow, with some not receiving any. A villager was quoted by Reuters: "To be frank, those rescue boats cannot go through those narrow lanes inside the village. A lot of them depend on their relatives rowing small wooden boats to get to them... It is hard to help these people inside there." Another villager, Shou Pengfei  said, "Some did not even get any relief items. There is no electricity and you get bitten by mosquitoes all the time." According to  the Beijing Climate Centre, weather trends have shifted drastically. Currently the  rain is coming in shorter but fiercer bursts, with  protracted periods of drought in between the torrential rain. The heavy  rainfall is not likely to reduce the crop failure caused by months of drought, especially in the north, the heart of China's grain-growing bread basket, where many rivers have dried up. According to reports, the northern countryside  has been left devastated by the droughts. Huge dams hundreds of meters wide are now small, muddy pools. Large cities such as Beijing are draining the underground water sources and China is facing a long-term water crisis.Meanwhile, China is engaged in  a huge multi-year engineering project designed to move water to the parched north and away from the flooded south. The North-South water project is a massive series of canals and pipes designed to carry water from the Yangtze and Yellow rivers to Beijing.It is likely, analysts predict, that Chinese crop shortages will increase food prices worldwide. Even before the latest flooding, the severe drought in the north caused a  shortfall in China's crop yields that will likely  affect the price of wheat and may propel a price increase in global markets.Heavy rainfalls have caused massive floods in Southern Bavaria, Western Austria and Central Switzerland.In Southern Bavaria authorities have declared a state of emergency. The city of Garmisch-Partenkirchen is cut off from the outside world. Near Augsburg a freeway had to be closed because a bridge was on the verge of collapsing after water had damaged the foundation. In the Austrian states of Tyrol and Vorarlberg authorities are battling with floods that intensified during the night with record rainfall. In Vorarlberg a brook broke into a house and caused a gas explosion injuring six people. One person is missing after he and his car were swept away. In the capital of Tyrol, Innsbruck, all bridges over the Inn had to be closed. In Western Tyrol, landslides killed one man and injured another.In Switzerland the cities of Bern and Lucerne were partially flooded. Mudslides killed two firefighters who were trying to evacuate a farm. In the canton of Zürich one man drowned, and a woman in Graubünden is missing after she too fell into a stream. The Swiss government estimates the floodings caused a damage of at least US$79 million.A 146,000 ton oil tanker carrying a crane has collided with a barge named the Hebei Spirit off the coast of South Korea spilling more than 10,000 metric tons of oil (1.8 million barrels) into the sea in what is being called the country's worst oil spill. There are no reports of any injuries.The tanker has suffered at least three large gashes on its hull and the spill has since began to wash ashore south of Seoul. Residents described the water as all black. Nearly 60 miles (100 kilometers) of shoreline are at risk of being destroyed."We are worried about an ecological disaster. We have set up a boom, trying to stop oil from spreading along the coast, but oil sometimes overflows it depending on the currents. If we fail to contain the spread, it is feared (it will) inflict serious damage to the coast," said spokesman for the ministry of maritime affairs and fisheries for S. Korea, Kim Jong-Sik. He also stressed that the spill has not yet caused any damage which "will depend on how the sea currents move in coming hours. We have 40 vessels out there fighting the oil spill."Emergency workers in the region of Taean are fighting to stop the oil slick, which is over 20km (12 miles) long.The electric plant supplies the regions of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Goiás, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, and Espírito Santo, as well as 90% of neighbouring Paraguay, which was almost completely without power for fifteen minutes.  Brazilian Energy Minister Edson Lobao stated that the cause of the "complete paralysis" of the plant was not yet known, but put forward a theory that lightning may have caused the high-tension supply lines to short out.Although this is not the first time that Brazil has had power outages, with severe loss of electricity in 2001, 2005 and 2007, radio station Bandnews estimated that 50 million people—a quarter of Brazil's population—were affected, one of the largest outages in recent history.A few hours after the power cut, the hydroelectric plant came back on line and the affected regions gradually regained power, allowing the areas in chaos caused by lack of traffic lights and power to underground railways to return to normal, and residents to put out their candles.Before Hurricane Rita arrived, cars idling for hours in traffic jams near Houston began running out of gas, stranding evacuees in their cars.  The New York Times reported Friday morning that "Colossal 100-mile-long traffic jams left many people stranded and out of gas as the huge storm bore down on the Texas coast on Thursday. ... Acknowledging that "being on the highway is a deathtrap," Mayor Bill White asked for military help in rushing scarce fuel to stranded drivers."The obvious express routes slowed to a crawl.  Some drivers reported easy travel on rural roads, while others encountered heavy traffic on two-lane highways.Constantly during the evacuation on two-lane highways, people would take over the other lanes, causing some head-on collisions. Even when the line jumpers didn't get in a wreck, they still slowed the flow of traffic because they had to merge back into the right lane at some point. The general attitude towards these cheaters was very hostile. Curses and hand signals were exchanged. To stop the cheaters, cars would swerve in front of those who tried to pass or not let them merge back in line, often causing an accident, or at least causing a backup in the lane of oncoming traffic.  Sometimes blockers would occupy the shoulder as well as the lane to stop them cutting back into the line.Small towns such as Magnolia were overwhelmed by the evacuees passing through. The majority of gas stations were closed and out of gas, and only a few restaurants were open.On Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a weather emergency in New York City, New York.  The announcement was issued as a preemptive measure in preparation for an expected 6-12 inches of snow Wednesday, although the Metropolitan Transportation Authority claims to be ready for 14 inches.  Bloomberg explained the meaning of the preemptive announcement by stating: "We recognize that we did not do the job that New Yorkers rightly expect of us in the last storm.  We intend to make sure that does not happen again." Despite declaring an emergency, the mayor said the city would not make the decision to close public schools until 5 AM.The city is looking for people to shovel snow off sidewalks and intersections.  The New York City Housing Authority announced on their Twitter page, "Turn a snow day into a payday. The city is looking for snow removal help. Apply now."  The linked page offered $12 an hour to shovel snow for the city.Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana has ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city ahead of Hurricane Gustav.Nagin states that residents "need to be scared" in what he calls "the mother of all storms". Residents are to be out of the city by Sunday evening. Even before the announcement, tens of thousands of people had already began to flee the city on Saturday. Nagin also stated that as many as 10,000 people were taken out of the city by buses they provided, trains and planes."This storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day. I'm not sure we've seen anything like this," said Nagin to reporters during a press conference Saturday."If you are stubborn enough, if you are not taking this as seriously as we need you to take it, and if you decide to stay; you are on your own. Anyone who decides to stay, I'll say it like I said it before Katrina: make sure you have an axe, because you will be carving your way, or busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that you will be surrounded with in this event," said Nagin during a press conference yesterday.Along with the issuing of the mandatory evacuation order, Nagin detailed a dawn-till-dusk curfew and said that emergency services would be unavailable after 4am Monday, south of Highway 22. He continued, explaining evacuation plans for the 500,000 residents of the New Orleans area, including the use of contraflow lanes on major highways and the use of over 1000 buses to aid the evacuation effort.  He also detailed the relief preparations including over 1500 National Guard personnel being deployed in the area and the medical care provisions.In 2005, New Orleans was devastated when levees broke during Hurricane Katrina. Nearly 2,000 people were killed when the storm made landfall along Louisiana's coast.A stampede today has killed over 717 Muslim pilgrims, officials say, in Mina, outside Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the Muslims' holy city, where the pilgrims gathered to throw stones at one of the three walls to symbolize the stoning of the devil, a ritual performed during the Hajj. The cause of the stampede is uncertain.Civil defence of Saudi Arabia mentioned the death toll is continuing to rise, and 863 pilgrims were injured during the incident, and also mentioned rescue operations are under way with, as of earlier today, 4000 personnel along with more than 200 emergency and rescue units present at the scene.This is reportedly the worst Hajj pilgrimage disaster in 25 years. A similar incident in Mina in 2006 killed more than 350 pilgrims.A medical helicopter crashed into a fence just outside a house in Tucson, Arizona on Wednesday afternoon, killing all three crew members on board. The crash occurred at 1:42 p.m. Arizona time (21:42 UTC) at the intersection of Glenn Street and Park Avenue. Eyewitness Ricardo Carrasco said that he saw the rotors stop working and the helicopter start plummeting towards the ground, with the pilot attempting to steer it away from the house.According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopter was a Eurocopter AS350B3 flown in the LifeNet Arizona fleet. It was operated by the Colorado-based Air Methods Corporation, which specializes in flying emergency medical helicopters."This is a sad day for all of us at Air Methods and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family and friends of our employees who perished while on duty," Air Methods Corporation CEO Aaron Todd said after the crash.Two other fatal aviation accidents were reported in the United States on Wednesday. In Alaska, a United States Air Force C-17 Globemaster transport plane crashed while preparing for an air show, killing all four crew members. Earlier, Delaware, Ohio city councilman and airport commissioner James Moore died when his rented light plane crashed and caught fire close to the city's airport.A medical helicopter has crashed near Chicago, Illinois killing three crew members and the patient, a thirteen-month-old baby girl. The crew aboard the helicopter included the pilot, a nurse and a paramedic.The helicopter, operated by Air Angels Inc., was transporting the baby to Children's Memorial Hospital from Valley West Hospital, when it hit a wire connected to a 734-foot (224-meter) radio tower in Aurora and burst into flames around 12:00 a.m. (EDT). The baby was suffering from epileptic seizures. The cause of the crash is not known, and there were no reported problems with the helicopter before it took off. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is ongoing.This is the third crash which involved an Air Angels helicopter. In 2003, a pilot was killed when his chopper crashed. An investigation concluded that the cause was pilot error, and bad weather. Another chopper crashed in 2007, but there were no injuries.Rail services between Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia are expected to be disrupted until early next week following a fatal crash between a truck and freight train in Lismore, Victoria 170 Km (105 miles) South-West of Melbourne.The B-Double truck hit the side of a 1,375 metre long freight train at a level crossing at 7:13 a.m. AEST on Thursday in heavy fog, derailing two locomotives and 44 goods wagons. Victorian police said that the truck had been wedged beneath the wreckage of the train.The driver of the truck, thought to be a 34-year-old man from Wedderburn in Victoria's North-West died in the crash. The train driver and an observer escaped uninjured. Police said it could take a number of days to retrieve the truck driver's body. "It could possibly take days to retrieve the body" a Victorian police spokesperson said.Great Southern Railways, which operates "The Overland" passenger train service between Melbourne and Adelaide said it expected rail services to be disrupted up until early next week. The company will transfer passengers to bus services or allow them to claim a full refund.The crash will also disrupt freight services between Melbourne and Adelaide.Local residents and the Victorian opposition are blaming the crash on the level crossing itself, which has no booms, lights or bells.Rob Dennis, a local resident said the level crossing is the cause of the crash, as it is not fitted with boom gates or flashing lights."And it's a blind turn for anything in a large vehicle," he said. Terry Mulder, the opposition's transport spokesperson said the Bracks Government should have spent part of the $750 million allocated to fast rail projects to upgrading level crossings in Victoria."The State Labor Government has wasted $750 million on fast rail projects," Mr Mulder said.Mr Mulder said that Victoria has 2,274 level crossings, 1,468 which have no warning systems in place.Friday marks the 50th anniversary of a mining disaster which occured in Lanarkshire, Scotland on September 18, 2009, killing 47 miners. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond MSP unveiled a bronze statue and a memorial garden in Moodiesburn on Sunday in front of a crowd of approximately 600. At roughly 0700 BST on September 18, 1959, 47 men who were working in Auchengeich Collery in North Lanarkshire, Scotland were overcome by smoke as they were walking down to start work. They were subsequently killed after being trapped by a fire in the mine which prevented them from escaping. At the time, a decision had been made to flood the pit after attempts to rescue the men failed. Only one miner had managed to survive the blaze. It transpired that the fire was caused by an electrical fault 1,000 ft below the surface. First Minister Salmond unveiled a memorial garden and a bronze statue which had been placed to mark the 50th anniversary of the incident. The statue is one of a miner. A religious service was carried out from Bishop Joseph Devine. Tom Clarke, MP for Chryston and Bellshill, also attended the event. Memorial committee chairman Daniel Taylor read out the names of the late 47 people while another person was playing bagpipes in the background.When the service came to a close, First Minister Salmond commented on the tragedy, saying "The tragedy at Auchengeich Colliery left barely a town, village or mining family in North Lanarkshire unaffected. Fifty years on, the memories of the fateful day which claimed the lives of so many husbands, fathers, brothers and sons endure and I am honoured to pay tribute to them. Scotland is fortunate enough to have been blessed with rich natural resources, from the abundant coal seams of the central belt to the oil and gas reserves off our shores and the emerging renewable energy sources we are just beginning to feel the benefits of. But we should never forget the human cost which has come with that. Just as the Piper Alpha tragedy more than two decades ago underlined the hazards of North Sea exploration, the Auchengeich disaster showed all too starkly the dangers and risks which miners all over Scotland took for granted as part of their job every time they descended the pits. The excellent work of the people of North Lanarkshire and Auchengeich Miners' Welfare has provided this new memorial garden and magnificent bronze sculpture. Together, they are a truly fitting tribute to those 47 brave men who died in Auchengeich half a century ago."The roof of the new Menorca Airport terminal in Spain collapsed at 12:32 p.m. local time, trapping 20 people and injuring three. The terminal was scheduled to be inaugurated in a few months time.Indonesian authorities have ordered the compulsory evacuation of thousands of residents living on the slopes of the volcano Mount Merapi in Central Java. The alert level has been raised to the highest level, warning of an imminent eruption of the volcano that has been rumbling for weeks and spewing lava and black ash."This morning we raised the status of Merapi to the top alert which is the red code" said Subandrio, head of the Merapi section at the Centre for Volcanological Research and Technology Development."Every resident has been ordered to evacuate.""Because there has been constant lava flows that cause hot gases, we have raised the status to the highest level," said Bambang Dwiyanto, head of the region's vulcanology center.More than 1,000 people who live closest to the crater, including the elderly and mothers with young children, have already been evacuated. But some residents have remained reluctant to leave; they fear losing property and livestock. 27,000 locals in 3 villages could be affected by this eruption. The scientists have warned that the greatest danger could come from hot gasses expelled from the volcano's crater. The 3,000m (9,700ft) peak, in densely populated Central Java province, is one of 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia and part of the Pacific "Ring of Fire" - a series of volcanoes stretching from the Americas through Japan and Southeast Asia.It has small eruptions every 3-4 years and larger eruptions every 10-15 years. It has produced more pyroclastic flows, popularly known as heat cloud and magma, than any other volcano in the world. A gas cloud from the volcano's last eruption in 1994 killed 60 people. During the eruption in 1930, 1,300 people died. Historians say that Mount Merapi has been active for 10,000 years. The locals consider Mount Merapi very sacred. According to the local folklore the volcano's eruption is the result of spirits being angered by not receiving sufficient offerings or by a disrespectful attitude among the people on the slopes.Drug maker Merck & Co. was found liable for a person's death concerning the use of the pain medication Vioxx, according to a jury verdict in a Texas court.  The plaintiff's case, headed by the widow of Robert Ernst, who died in 2001 of an irregular heartbeat and of clogged arteries while on the drug Vioxx, was successfully awarded $253.4 million dollars.  Vioxx was pulled from the shelves in 2004 after a study discovered it could double the risk of a heart attack or stroke if taken for longer than 1.5 years. However, the US government agency, the FDA, decided in February of this year to allow the product back on the shelves.Merck's stock price dropped 10% within minutes of the verdict being announced, and continued to fall hours after. There are in excess of 4,200 other Vioxx-related lawsuits pending across the USA. The company plans to appeal the decision.A resident of Schaumburg, Illinois in the (U.S.) was severely injured by an industrial punch press machine on Monday. He died an hour later.Elk Grove Village police said William Naras, 48, was operating the machine at a local metal manufacturing plant when he became pinned by an I-beam, or metal arm, about 4 p.m. He was transported to Alexian Brothers Medical Center in Elk Grove Village where medics pronounced him dead at 4:51 p.m.The death was ruled an industrial accident and reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, according to a spokesperson for the Cook County medical examiner's office.Presses of the type which killed Naras routinely develop pressures in the 80,000 pounds (40 tons) per square inch range, according to manufacturers’ Internet pages.A methane gas explosion occurred at the Ulyanovskaya Mine near the city of Novokuznetsk in the Kemerovo region of Siberia. At least 106 people have been reported to be killed in the blast. Conflicting reports say that at least thirteen to forty-three miners are still trapped underground or missing, as well as 75 to 93 have been reported to have survived the blast.The mine disaster is the deadliest accident in Russia's mining industry in over a decade. The mine, which was opened in 2002, had around 200 miners inside at the time of the methane gas explosion. The Kemerovo governor Aman Tuleyev said that when the blast occurred, the mine's management was underground inspecting a newly installed safety system made by a British company. British experts and representatives of a management of the mine have gone down under the ground shortly before explosion. Tuleyev stated that on mine start-up, "the newest English system on a safety of conducting mountain works under the ground" should take place. The operator of the mine is Yuzhkuzbassugol, Russia's biggest producer of deep-mined coal. The spokeswoman of the Emergencies Ministry stated that the blast occurred at 08:00 GMT, and that eighty-three miners had been safely evacuated from the mine shaft.A soldier identified as flight mechanic Sgt. Dan Neftali Botello Ramos has died after the helicopter he was travelling in crashed yesterday in Guerrero, Mexico. Two other airmen among the ten on board have been hospitalised with serious injuries after the Bell 212 went down.A defense department statement said that the helicopter was conducting operations related to "the permanent campaign against drug trafficking" and attributed the accident to a mechanical problem without elaborating.

The accident occurred near the town of Vallecitos de Zaragoza, which is roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Ciudad Altamirano.The United Kingdom's Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), a division of the security agency MI5, has raised its threat level to critical. Critical denotes that a terrorist attack is expected imminently. The threat is noted as being from al-Qaida, groups associated with al-Qaida, and other Islamic extremists. The change was made as a result of an earlier incident where a burning jeep drove into Glasgow Airport, which has been linked to the attempted London car bombings of the previous day.MI5 also indicated that, although the threat comes principally from al-Qaida and related networks, Northern Ireland-related terrorism remains a threat.In a press release Saturday, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said, "I can confirm that JTAC has raised the national threat level to critical. This is in response to the events of the last 48 hours. Critical is the highest level of threat, and the threat level will be closely reviewed on a regular basis. Appropriate security measures have been put in place."A terror alert system was set up by the UK government to keep the public informed about the level of threat to the UK from terrorism. According to the Home Office, the likelihood of a terrorist attack taking place in the UK is identified in following threat levels:critical - an attack is expected imminentlysevere - an attack is highly likelysubstantial - an attack is a strong possibilitymoderate - an attack is possible but not likelylow - an attack is unlikelyAt least five people have died and sixteen were injured in a train derailment in Tabasco, Mexico  yesterday, according to the director of Tabasco civil protection. The cargo train is often used by migrants.The derailment occurred at approximately 3:00 a.m local time (8:00 a.m UTC), with eight of the twelve cars overturning. The state government reported that at least 250 Honduras citizens were traveling on the train, which had a scrap metal cargo. The train company and rescue workers continue to search the wreckage and treat survivors, but the remote and marshy site hinders efforts. Two cranes have been dispatched to assist. Mario Bustillos Borge, the Red Cross chief in Tabasco, noted that current information on the numbers deceased and injured was hard to confirm due to the complex nature of the rescue. "There are some very high estimates, and others that are more conservative," he said. The first car and the engine, which did not overturn, were used to transport the injured to a local hospital in Veracruz.The train, dubbed 'The Beast' by locals, was headed north from the Guatemalan border at the time of the accident. Migrants regularly try to hitch a ride to the US by climbing onto its roof or in between cars. Preliminary reports suggest that the tracks had shifted following heavy rains.A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.  The governor's office said nineteen of the injured were police officers. Police said they suspect an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant of responsibility for the attack.Turkish media reported two police officers, Yusuf Evrin and Serdar Şakir, spotted the bomb in the vehicle as the driver approached the building. The officers opened fire on the driver before the bomb exploded. This follows another suicide bombing in Istanbul four days earlier that wounded several people, and three other militant attacks this year in Turkish cities populated with high numbers of tourists. Daesh have not claimed responsibility for any of these attacks.Turkish police claim to have found evidence linking the suspect to Daesh and conducted a raid on his home. They took the suspect's father in for questioning and DNA testing, in an attempt to confirm the bomber's identity. The US-led coalition against Daesh, of which Turkey is a member, carried out airstrikes in Syria last Thursday. Gaziantep is near the Syrian border and a city official estimated to news website The Conversation the area harbors as many as 400,000 Syrian refugees. Suspected Daesh militants amongst them have recently been subjected to police raids. Foreign travel advisories are warning tourists of an increased threat of terrorist attacks in Turkey.A United States military MH-47 Chinook helicopter has crashed in Colquitt County, Georgia after clipping a wire connected to the WFXL television tower.

The final sections of the northbound lanes of the new Interstate 35W St. Anthony Falls Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota were put in place on July 5. The final segment was raised with a barge-mounted crane from the Mississippi River below. A temporary bridge now connects the two segments.The remaining seven-foot gap will be closed in several days with concrete which is poured in place. The segments for the southbound lanes will now be raised and connected.  The segments were cast in a work area which was on the 35W roadbed and were then moved to Bohemian Flats, near the University of Minnesota West Bank campus.  A crane places each segment on a barge for delivery upstream to the bridge site.The bridge may be completed as early as September, well ahead of the scheduled opening date of December 24th.A major oil pipeline in Minnesota exploded and caught fire, killing two workers. The pipeline carries oil from Saskatchewan, Canada to close to Chicago, United States, representing 16% of America's total oil imports.The section of the pipe that exploded was undergoing maintenance at the time to address a pinhole leak first identified three weeks earlier, and patched at the time with a metal sleeve. On Wednesday, the entire section was removed and replaced with a new one. When oil was reintroduced on Thursday morning, oil leaked where the new section joined the pre-existing pipe, triggering the fatal explosion.The fire was extinguished later the same day.The line is split between four separate pipes. After the explosion, all four pipes were shut down, resulting in the global price surge, but this subsided for the most part after it became clear that the three undamaged pipelines had returned to normal operation, restoring 80% of the line's capacity, and that the accident pipe is expected to be back in use in a matter of days."There were no problems found in that area where the leak occurred," reporters were told by Larry Springer, spokesman for Enbridge, the Canadian company that owns the line. High-tech equipment had been through the line in 2006 to check for any signs of problems.Enbridge identified the deceased as Dave Mussati Jr. and Steve Arnovich, both of whom were contract workers based in Superior, Wisconsin. The damaged section of pipe is in Clearbrook, which is approximately 350 miles Northwest of Minneapolis.Enbridge metallurgists have been sent to examine the failed section in an effort to determin the cause of the accident. Other Enbridge workers are working to clear spilled oil from the site. It is expected that once this is complete, the pipe will return to service. Global crude oil prices temporarily spiked by over US$4 per barrel but closed yesterday slightly above original prices.A minor, low-intensity aftershock of the March 11 earthquake occurred last night in the Pichilemu area, ONEMI reported.

The boat and gift shop became a popular attraction for tourists visiting the Mississippi Gulf Coast.But on August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina came ashore pushing a 20-plus foot storm surge leaving mostly everything on the beachfront destroyed. Only a few things were standing including the Biloxi Lighthouse, the Friendship Oak, and the S.S. Hurricane Camille. Lucille Moody decided not to rebuild the gift shop, so there the S.S. Camille stands, a rusted hulk on a beachfront that is quickly rebuilding.People want it gone, suggesting it is an "eyesore", but others suggest this historic object be preserved, especially after the loss of historic sites including Grass Lawn and Tullis-Toledo Manor. They suggest a coat of paint and some repairs could make the boat much more appealing.At least ten people are dead after a large, destructive tornado tore through Yazoo City, Mississippi yesterday. The tornado has been rated an EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and is estimated to have had at most 170 mph winds.Five of the deaths were in Choctaw County, four in Yazoo County, and one in Holmes County. 21 people have been hospitalized as a result of the storm, and others have been trapped in cars and houses. Multiple injuries resulted from cars being blown off of Interstate 55 during the storm.The tornado moved along a path 97 miles long and 1.75 miles wide at its widest point. Among damaged or destroyed buildings included at least twenty houses, a church, and several businesses. According to Yazoo City mayor McArthur Straughter, the storm ripped the roofs off of every building in the area. Fallen trees and debris are hindering access to some parts of Yazoo City and Yazoo County. Before ravaging the city, the tornado damaged a chemical plant in Louisiana, causing a nitrogen leak and several injuries.The Salvation Army is aiding relief efforts by providing hot meals, coffee, cold drinks, and spiritual counseling to tornado victims in Yazoo and Warren Counties.The tornado occurred on the third, and most active, day of a severe weather outbreak that had previously affected areas of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, the latter two of which were also effected during Saturday's outbreak. The Storm Prediction Center has received 104 reports of tornadoes so far during this outbreak.United States - According to NASA's Near Earth Object Program, 2004 MN4's assessed risk has been corrected downward to zero on the Torino scale.  The Torino scale is the current method by which astronomers classify the likelihood of an impact with a near-Earth object.  A score of zero means that the possibility of a collision between the asteroid and Earth has been ruled out of consideration.  2004 MN4 was once tentatively estimated as having the highest potential of any asteroid to hit the Earth.  Its risk was first calculated as 2 out of 10 on the Torino scale.  This rank was upgraded to Level 4 Dec. 24, giving it the highest score ever for a near-Earth asteroid. It was considered to have a 1 in 37 chance of striking the Earth.  Upon discovery of previously recorded sightings of the same asteroid, its estimated flight path was corrected and found to miss the Earth entirely, outside of the margin of error.  The asteroid will, however, make one of the closest passes of Earth ever seen.  It will pass close enough to the Earth's for the planet's gravitational field to influence the asteroid's orbital pattern. However, NASA's current risk analysis for the asteroid indicates that "no subsequent Earth encounters in the 21st century are of any concern."Touching down at 6:30 a.m.(EST) this morning in North Carolina, a tornado has killed eight people. Some mobile homes exploded, while others were moved off their foundations, according to Bob High, a reporter for the News Reporter newspaper. Strong winds threw one couple from their home into the neighbor's yard, he added.Several people are reported to be missing and as many as 200 emergency services people, along with trained dogs, are currently searching for them. Fears are that some may be trapped under the rubble.Red Cross teams are being assembled. They will enter the area as soon as Columbus County Emergency Services deem it is safe.As of 12:32 p.m.(EST), there are still tornado warnings active in the area.The storm has left thousands without power.An earthquake hit the island of Crete in Greece on Sunday morning. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre measured it as magnitude 5.4, and reported the earthquake occurred at a depth of 60 kilometers, 132 kilometers southeast of Iraklion. The earthquake took place at 18:21:01 local time (15:21:01 UTC).The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that the earthquake had a magnitude of 5.0, and that it occurred at a depth of 28.8 kilometers.According to the USGS, the epicenter was centered 125 kilometers east-southeast of Iraklion, Crete; 220 kilometers southwest of Rodos, Dodecanese Islands; 230 kilometers east-southeast of Chania, Crete; and 405 kilometers southeast of Athens.USGS noted that an aftershock occurred at 15:35:36, with a magnitude of 4.4, at a depth of 35 kilometers.A moderate earthquake hit Indonesia at 15:05:39 (UTC). The magnitude 6.0 quake did not create a tsumani. The epicenter was in the Northern Sumatra region, 80 km. SSW of Banda Aceh.There is no word on damage or casulties yet.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a preliminary magnitude 6.4 earthquake has struck off the coast of Oregon in the United States.The quake struck at 01:37 (UTC) and its epicenter was located 242 kilometers (151 miles) west, northwest of Barview. It registered at a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).So far there are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths and no tsunami warning has been issued, but small waves could be locally generated by any possible landslides."The magnitude is such that a tsunami is not expected. However, in coastal areas of intense shaking, locally generated tsunamis can be triggered by underwater landslides," said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in a statement on its website. No further messages will be generated it adds.Firefighters in Bandon report that they didn't even feel the tremor and police say that no one has yet called to report any quake related incidents. Bandon is also located within 150 miles of the quake's epicenter.Molten steel spilled out and killed 32 workers at the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation mill in the city of Tieling in Liaoning province, China.The ladle containing 1,500-degree-Celsius liquid steel poured into an open room, where employees take breaks in-between shift changes, at 7:45 a.m. local time. At least 6 others were injured, one of them critically. "It is the most serious accident to hit China's steel industry since 1949," said China's deputy head of the State Administration of Work Safety, Sun Huashan.At least 4 workers have been arrested after the accident. The manager of mill, an operator, technician and a supervisor of a workshop were all arrested and are being questioned as an investigation in launched into what caused the accident to occur.Although Monday night's quake off Indonesia, at 8.7 on the Richter scale, was one of the ten largest in the past 100 years, the death toll has been relatively few. Damage was also less than expected, and the feared tsunami never eventuated. But 430 are confirmed dead, with aid workers guessing a final toll of 1,000 to 2,000.Over 270,000 died following last year's December 26, 9.0-Richter quake and tsunami, prompting alarm when such a large quake struck on Monday night. Mass evacuations and alerts turned out to be unnecessary, when the potential hazard of a tidal wave failed to arise.Initially Indonesian Vice-President Yusuf Kalla put the number of dead at the island of Nias, near the quake's epicentre, at up to 2,000. But officials who flew over the area said the damage could be less than expected.Indonesian National Coordinating Disaster Relief Agency said only 330 were so far confirmed dead at Nias, with a further 100 coming from another island, Simeuleu, according to the head of the health office in Aceh province, Mulya Hasjmy, and numbers expected to rise as workers further explore the rubble.The quake occurred offshore, with its centre around 205km west of Sibolga on Sumatra island, and 245km southwest of Sumatran city Medan, about 320km from that of the quake which caused December's tsunami.Oxfam aid workers at Gunung Sitoli, the main town on Nias, described the scene. "The water system has failed completely and huge holes have been made in the roads," said Alessandra Villas-Boas. "Bodies are being pulled from the rubble as I speak."President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has declared a state of emergency, and is to visit Nias today. The airport there was found to be intact, patients were receiving medical treatment already, and a field hospital was in the process of being erected on mainland.A fire has been confirmed at The Monte Carlo Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in the United States. Reports say the fire, which was reported at about 11:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) began in the top center of the hotel and quickly spread to the top five floors, burning a large section of the roof and facade. Flames were seen shooting out of the top of the hotel. Also visible was a plume of black smoke which according to witnesses, was visible for many miles.At least three fire companies responded to the scene and quickly began to extinguish the fire. As of 12:00 p.m., the fire was nearly contained. The Strip has been closed off in front of the hotel while firefighters continue to fight the blaze.All guests have been evacuated from the hotel with no injuries reported. The hotel has 3,002 guest rooms, 211 suites and is 32 stories high.The cause of the fire is not known and is being investigated.A passenger train carrying at least 250 people, many of whom were children, derailed in Serbia-Montenegro and drove into a ravine Tuesday afternoon.Close to 200 have been injured and the death toll has risen to 44. Most of the passengers were schoolchildren returning from a ski trip."The accident occurred because of a failure of the train's braking system," said Interior Minister Jusuf Kalomperovic.At about 4 p.m. the four-car train derailed near Bioče, a small village nearly 15 kilometers northeast of Podgorica as it was emerging from a tunnel above the Moraca River."The train simply went wild, out of control," said one injured passenger. "I was fine because I was in a back compartment, those in the front got the worst of it.""It was horrible, I saw many dead and wounded around me," said another passenger from Hungary, Karman Chofu."I had fallen asleep when a loud noise woke me," said Stanislava Bukovic, 60, another injured passenger.Miodrag Djurovic, the head of the main Podgorica hospital, stated that another five passengers had died overnight. Djurovic also said at least 198 people, 90 of them children, have been treated at the hospital. "The children's hospital admitted 90 children, 34 of them are still there, six have undergone surgery," Djurovic said.Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Miroslav Ivanisevic told the media that the death toll stood at 30 and the amount injured at 135, but said those figures could rise as rescuers continue to reach victims. Ivanisevic described the wreck "as the worst rail accident in the history of Montenegro," Ivanisevic also said.President Filip Vujanovic and Prime Minister, Milo Djukanovic also rushed to the site. "A terrible tragedy happened at Bioče and everything is being done to reduce the number of casualties as much as possible," Vujanovic told reporters.Because of the accident, Montenegro's transport minister, Andrija Lompar, and National Railways chief Ranko Medenica resigned.The driver of the train has been arrested because of suspicion of negligence.The train was heading from the northeastern town of Bijelo Polje to the Montenegrin coastal city of Bar.A last gasp effort is underway to prevent the deportation of Montserratian refugees from New York City, U.S.A., to the disaster-stricken volcanic island they fled ten years ago.Representative w:Major Owens (D, NY), of Brooklyn, is hoping the outpouring of support for victims of the Asian tsunami will save the refugees from returning to an island with an active volcano that is at constant risk of a further catastrophe.Until last year, the Department of Homeland Security had allowed the families to stay in the United States under a special designation called “Temporary Protected Status”. But in July, secretary of homeland security, Tom Ridge, withdrew the status—not because it was safe to return to Montserrat, but because the volcano would remain active for decades to come and therefore was no longer a “temporary” danger. On February 27, the city’s estimated 100 Montserratians and their families will be forced to leave or risk deportation. A further 200 families, many of them living in Boston, are also under threat.Earlier efforts to win a reprieve for the Montserratians were blocked by anti-immigrant forces in the House of Representatives, led by congressman Tom Tancredo, of Colorado, Rep. Owens said. But he added that a new bill, which he introduced at the end of last month, might be more popular in the wake of the Asian disaster.“We hope that the approaching emergency situation plus the drama of the tsunami will help change some of the attitudes about this,” Rep. Owens said. “And some of the people who opposed this legislation on the basis that they opposed immigration, will see that it is not about immigration but about coming to the relief of people who have been victims of a natural disaster.”Meanwhile, New York’s tiny Montserratian community must wait and hope. For those not fortunate enough to have married a US citizen or to have found an employer willing to sponsor them, the coming weeks are crucial.Pearl Ryner, 40, a refugee who works as a medical technician at the King’s County Hospital in Brooklyn, said she refused to get married just so that she can stay in the United States. But she is a single mother with four children and she does not want to uproot her family and start over again.“I worry. I cry. I am still hoping,” Ms. Ryner said. “What do I do? Where do I begin? How do I pick four kids up and take them away? If I buy a plane ticket, where do I go? These are questions that I do not have an answer for.”The Department of Homeland Security has suggested that because Montserrat is a British overseas territory, Montserratians should go to the UK. But the refugees say they have no relatives or friends they can stay with in the UK, and that they have made homes and started careers and lives in the United States.If the refugees are deported to Montserrat it will be to a 35 square-mile island, two-thirds of which is buried beneath volcanic rubble and ash. The capital, Plymouth, in the south east of the island has been abandoned, and there is a housing and employment shortage.The Soufriere Hills Volcano erupted in 1995, but the British Foreign Office website warns that the volcano remains active. Heavy rain can cause mudflows, and people suffering from breathing problems risk airborne dust and volcanic ash. The collapse of a lava dome in 2001 spewed clouds of ash that affected Puerto Rico, a self-governing territory of the United States, 200 miles away.Moreover continued volcanic activity is triggering landslides that have caused two tsunamis in Montserrat during the past ten years. The first, on December 26, 1997, created a wave three meters tall, which rolled northwards along the coast. The second, in July 2003, measured about four meters and traveled to Guadeloupe 30 miles away.Sherry Coriette, 28, who works for a major retail company in New York, said that she still has not decided what to do. “I have a good job, I pay my bills,” Ms. Coriette said. “Eight years ago I left with nothing and now I am having to face starting all over again.”Matthew Dunn, chairman of the New York Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said that as long as there was a potential for danger, the United Sates should offer the people of Montserrat a safe haven.“I would argue that is what our country is all about: helping and protecting people,” Mr. Dunn said. “But the biggest shame in all of this is that because there is so few of them, they do not have a big enough voice.”At least 44 bodies have been recovered from a lake in India lake after a boat carrying tourists capsized in the water. The accident occurred in Periyar National Park located in the city of Kerala. The bodies of a mother, her child and one other individual were among the latest victims pulled from the water.On Wednesday, a boat carrying 75 people, mainly women and children, was returning from a fair that marked the end of the Durga Puja, an annual Hindu festival celebrating the worship of the Hindu goddess Durga. Fifteen people, including the boat driver and two staff members, were able to swim to safety after the boat capsized, but officials believe there are no other survivors. Reports say the person driving the boat turned sharply to one side before it capsized.Wikinews obtained exclusive pictures of the boat before and after the accident. Images show the boat significantly leaning to one side shortly before the accident occurred. A later image shows the boat almost entirely submerged as rescue workers frantically work to rescue the trapped passengers.According to the Indian Express, the boat was being operated by workers who were not trained in rescue tactics had the boat been suddenly damaged. The paper also claims that of the two person crew, a driver and a lascar named Victor Samuel, neither were assigned direct control of the boat. The paper also says the boat was not licensed to operate in the area it was traveling. The paper cites a 1921 law, which says the driver must watch over the engine while another crew member, a 'srank', drives the vessel, but no one in that position was aboard the vessel when it capsized. Samuel said that he only obtained his lascar license one year ago, contradicting earlier reports that suggested he had more than 15 years of experience driving similar boats.Officials are continuing to investigate the incident. So far, no criminal charges have been filed. The boat was made of mostly fiberglass, had two decks and was owned an operated by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, a government-owned company. According to reports, Samuel was only licensed to operate wooden boats and had no experience driving ones made of fiberglass. Samuel and the two staff members have been suspended pending the results of the investigation.Two more major earthquakes about 30-minutes apart, have struck in the countries of Papua New Guinea and Tonga, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Experts do not believe that the two quakes are related.The first quake struck in Papua New Guinea on the small island of New Britain at 0312 UTC and had a magnitude of 6.2. The second quake, on the island nation of Tonga struck at 0336 UTC with a magnitude of 6.7. No injuries or damage have been reported from either of the quakes."They're probably unrelated, they just happened at the same time," said geophysicist with Hawaii's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, Barry Hirshorn. He also said that neither quake posed a tsunami threat."No destructive Pacific-wide tsunami threat exists based on historical earthquake and tsunami data," said a statement n the warning center's website. However; the statement also said that large earthquakes like these could sometimes "generate tsunamis that can be destructive" within 100 km of the epicenters and added that cities in that range should be warned of the possibility and take "appropriate actions."Just yesterday, a magnitude 6.3 quake struck the island of Java in Indonesia that killed over 3,000 people.Debris believed to be part of an aircraft has washed ashore on an uninhabited island in the Maldives. The fragment, suspected to be from a wing, was found on Mendhoo island, within the Laamu Atoll. The finding comes after several pieces of suspected plane debris washed ashore on the resort island Vabbinfaru, within the Kaafu Atoll, some of which could be from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370). The newest piece of debris is white and severely damaged and dented in places. Some of the paint also appears to be peeling off. Authorities have collected the debris, to be examined later. Malaysian officials are currently investigating other debris to determine if they came from an aircraft and if so "discussions will be held to determine the next steps in terms of the process of analysis", said the Malaysian transport ministry in a statement.On Tuesday, a team of Malaysian investigators arrived in Maldives to take charge of debris washed ashore on Vabbinfaru on May 31, which had previously been disposed of as trash, and transport it back to Malaysia for further analysis. Malaysia said they believe the debris could be from MH370, but no official confirmation has been made."We (Malaysia) have an understanding with the authorities there [the Maldives] [...] we think the parts which were found about a month ago were parts of the aircraft," said Ab Aziz Kaprawi, the deputy transport minister for Malaysia as quoted by Bernama, a Malaysian government news agency. "They have to be further analysed and will be brought back to Malaysia for verification", he added.Since the Vabbinfaru incident, debris has washed ashore on at least three other Maldives locations, the Baa Atoll and the islands of Fehendhoo and Fulhahdhoo, but much of it isn't believed to be from an aircraft. Abdulla Rasheed, a captain of a cargo boat which recently capsized in the waters off the Maldives, stated, "From the pictures of the debris found on most of the islands, I can almost certainly say that they are from the cargo we were carrying." Despite this possibility, any debris located is being gathered up until Malaysian authorities can examine it."We are collecting any unidentified debris and storing them in a warehouse so that the Malaysians can carry out tests and determine if it is from their plane or not," said the office of the Maldives President in a statement reported by Haveeru Daily before the Malaysian investigators arrived.MH370, while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, China, vanished on March 8, 2014. All 239 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. On the day the plane went missing, residents on the small Maldives island of Kudahuvadhoo claimed to have seen a very "low flying jumbo jet" crash into the Indian Ocean. Some also noted the colors appeared to resemble that of a Malaysia Airlines plane. "I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly", one resident was quoted as saying to the newspaper Haveeru Daily. Some claim the plane appeared to be headed in the direction of Diego Garcia, but Malaysian authorities have discounted those claims."Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of Flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country [Maldives]. Furthermore, the data of radars at Maldives airports have also been analysed and shows no indication of the said flight," said Malaysia's transport ministry at the time of the reports.173 people have been killed in fires raging through Australia, making this the deadliest bushfire in Australian history. Nearly 815,447 acres (330,000 hectares) have been burned and 750 homes have been burned to the ground.  In 1983, 75 people were killed on what was dubbed the Ash Wednesday fires. 71 people were killed in similar fires in 1939. The country's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, calls the fires "mass murder"."This is of a level of horror that few of us anticipated. There are no words to describe it other than mass murder," said Rudd who also called the situation "numbing".The combination of Australia's long term drought, a record heat wave with temperatures as high as 47.2 degrees Celcius (117 Fahrenheit) and winds over 100km/h (60mph), sparked the dozens of fires across Victoria. Some are being investigated as arson. Over 60,000 firefighters are battling the various blazes. These fires although common in Australia have caught people unprepared due to their intensity and speed. Survivors of Kinglake tell of how up until 10 minutes before the fire started to tear through their country town people were unaware of how close and dangerous the fire really was.24 people from Kinglake and Kinglake West have died and hundreds of houses have burnt to the ground. Over 1,500 people in Kinglake alone have been left homeless, left with a town which has mostly burned to the ground. Many people have been caught in the terrifying position of staying and fighting for their houses or fleeing before the fires arrive. Many of the people who have died have attempted to flee in their cars too late and were caught in the middle of the inferno, some being burned alive. Despite the efforts of firefighters, many towns have been totally destroyed, leaving nothing but piles of ashes. Witnesses and survivors of fires in Marysville and Narbethong, Victoria, describe the towns as being totally wiped out or substantially damaged.Authorities are investigating the fires, some 20% of them are being called arson or have being started by human error, leaving much of the scorched land a crime scene of ashes. Some of the fires were reignited by arsonists after firefighters had already taken control of them, according to one fire official in Victoria. Others are believed to have been started by lighting tires on fire."Some of these fires have started in localities that could only be by hand, it could not be natural causes," said deputy commissioner for the Victoria state police, Kieran Walshe. Fire fighting operations chief, Steve Warrington says that the fire departments "know [they] have someone who is lighting fires in this community."The Federal Government has pledged $10 million (4.4 million pounds) in immediate assistance with more to come as the situation becomes clear. The other States of Australia have also announced their plans to help Victoria and Victorians during this time. New South Wales will send 250 firefighters and 50 tankers. The Australian Capital Territory home to Canberra has pledged 90 firefighters and support equipment.  Australia's neighbour New Zealand is currently considering what assistance it will be able to provide. For the moment, the nation has sent 100 firefighters to help with battling the blazes. The team is expected to arrive to Australia in as little as 24 hours."What we can do is, with that manpower, really help out even if it's just a matter of relieving at times. We've obviously got to make sure we protect our domestic situation as well," said New Zealand prime minister John Key.Yesterday at about 10:30 pm local time (2030 UTC) in the French city of Nice, a  truck killed at least 84 people and more than 100 people were injured, at least 18 critically, who were watching fireworks on Bastille Day evening, French officials reported. The attacker was later shot dead by the police.The attacker drove for some distance — by one report as much as 2 km (more than a mile) — through the crowd along the Promenade des Anglais. The owner of the Le Queenie Restaurant near the seaport told  France Info, "People went down like ninepins".Agence France-Presse reported police had discovered identity papers of a 31-year old Tunisian-Frenchman along with, according to one source, fake weapons including rifles and an "inactive" grenade.20-year-old eyewitness Fanny told Reuters the fast-approaching truck was moving in a zigzag manner, driving in the pedestrian area. Another survivor described sheltering with others in a restaurant. An eyewitness named Nader told BFM TV he thought the driver had lost control of the truck. Later, he also saw the driver taking out a gun.European Council President Donald Tusk said, "Tragic paradox that the subject of the Nice Attack was people celebrating liberty, equality, and fraternity" ((fr))French language: ‍C’est un tragique paradoxe que les cibles de l’attaque Nice attaque soient les gens qui célébraient liberté, égalité, fraternité.French president François Hollande tweeted, "France is tearful, sorrowful, but she is strong and will always be more than the fanatics who now want to smite her." ((fr))French language: ‍La France est éplorée, affligée, mais elle est forte et le sera toujours plus que les fanatiques qui veulent aujourd’hui la frapper.A few hours before the incident, Hollande had announced the state of emergency would be lifted on July 26 after November's Paris attack, but after this incident, he announced extending the state of emergency into October. Condemning the incident, he said, "We will further strengthen our actions in Iraq and in Syria." He also said "operational reserves" will be called up to support the armed forces in France.Fifteen people, among them disabled war veterans, were killed on Saturday after a hospital in Somalia was bombarded by mortar rockets launched by opposition fighters.The attack was targeted at a residential area in the country's capital of Mogadishu, but instead struck a veteran's hospital nearby.Mohamed Abdi, a patient at the hospital, was a witness to the event. "I was sitting in my wheelchair about 10 meters [30 feet] away from my friends when a mortar exploded and smoke and dust covered us all. I saw my friends on the ground, with blood scattered everywhere like slaughtered goats," he told the Associated Press news agency.Somali human rights activist Ali Sheik Fadhaa condemned the attacks. "It is horrific and inhumane to shell civilian areas," he said.Somalia has been in a civil war since 1991, when the last effective government, led by Siad Barre, was overthrown by warlords, who soon afterwards started fighting between themselves.A fire broke out in southeast Moscow stemming from a gas pipeline. According to local officials, flames reached up to 200 meters (600 feet) above the city. According to the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, at least five people were injured by the fire, one of them suffering 35 percent burns on his body. There are no reports of deaths. The mayor added that the probable cause of the fire is "an upsurge of pressure in the pipeline, as a result of which an explosion took place underground." Deputy mayor Pyotr Birukov says he doesn't remember a fire of such proportions happening in Moscow.The fire broke out at 00:30 local time (20:30 on Saturday, GMT), sending flames into the sky. By the morning the fire was brought under control, reducing the flames to 20 meters (60 feet) of height. The Russian Ministry of Emergencies reported the fire being ranked as Category 5, the most serious category on the ministry's incident assessment scale. 35 fire brigade units were dispatched to fight the blaze. The fire is believed to have been caused by "technical" problems, according to Agence France-Presse as reported by breitbart.com."All of our efforts are directed towards reducing the temperature around the centre of the fire", said the deputy emergency situations minister Alexander Chupriyan. He also predicted that the fire will be put out by midday. Deputy mayor Birukov added that the city's energy system won't be affected by the fire. However, municipal telecommunications company reported that 80,000 people lost their phone connections, as the fire burnt nearby underground cables.The transportation authorities closed the traffic in the area near the fire, including the Michurinsky Avenue, an important arterial street connecting the outskirts with the Moscow River in the city center. About 25 parked cars with no occupants inside were damaged by the fire, while dozens of residents appeared to record the blaze with camcorders.The fire did not threaten the nearby apartment blocks. The building nearest to the fire is an administrative building 200 meters away and the nearest residential building is a 19-story apartment block 500 meters (1600 feet) away.Fires like this one are becoming increasingly frequent in the area of the former Soviet Union due to the aging structure of transporting energents, which has not been refit in decades. Officials are saying that the preparations for the Eurovision Song Contest finals due next weekend won't be affected.A power outage hit large parts of Tokyo, and Chiba, Japan. The electrical blackout occurred due to an industrial accident, in which a crane damaged some power lines accidentally at 7:40 AM local time (2240 UTC), the Kyodo News agency reported, quoting Tokyo Power Electric Co. Power was reported to have been restored to most areas within a few hours.At least two elevators stopped with an unknown number of people trapped inside, said a fire official in Tokyo. Some train services were halted. The number of passengers was lower than normal due to a holiday. About 800,000 residences were affected by the blackout, according to the power company. Most services have since then been restored.Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea delayed opening by an hour  as many rides did not function due to the power problems.Yesterday the body of Joanne Coombs, 40, was found in the same location as her daughter Natasha Coombs, 17, who was found dead on a railway line near Manningtree Station in Essex, England on August 10.Police stated that the mother's body was found after freight train operators reported a possible fault of the tracks when using them. A crew from a second freight train was instructed to investigate the report and found the body. It is thought that the death may have resulted from being hit by the first train which reported the fault, but the incident is not being treated as suspicious."On Tuesday evening the driver of the 1900 BST Liverpool Street to Norwich train service reported a possible track fault. The line was checked by the driver of the following freight train. He found the body of a woman near Manningtree station," said British Transport Police (BTP) inspector Ed Purchase.Neither of the deaths are being treated as suspicious, but police are not sure if Natasha's death was a suicide. Reports say that she had ended a relationship with 18 year-old Josh Brennan, her ex-boyfriend. An autopsy later confirmed that the cause of Natasha's death was consistent with being hit by a train.A formal identification of Mrs. Coombs has not yet taken place and an investigation is currently being conducted by the BTP.Hana Sahal, a 22-year-old nursing student from Somalia, and her nearly two-year-old daughter were found dead after the collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis. Sahal was five months pregnant. With other remains discovered Friday, the death toll from the collapase is now at least nine.Sahal died due to head injuries caused by the bridge's collapse. Omar Jamal, the director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center said that authorities informed Sahal's family of the death on Friday.Minneapolis received US$5 million in emergency aid the morning after the disaster, and a further $5 million was secured by Minnesota's congressional delegation to set up alternative transportation options for motorists.According to authorities, all remains that have been found have been identified, although there still may be people trapped in the bridge.Italy's Marco Simoncelli, 24, has died after a crash during the second lap of the 2011 Malaysia Moto GP Grand Prix held at the Sepang International Circuit. While veering accross the track on the exit of turn 11, Simoncelli was hit by the bike of Colin Edwards and fell into the path of Edwards and Valentino Rossi. The other riders were powerless to avoid Simoncelli. Such was the force of the collision, Simoncelli's helmet was dislodged and bounced several metres. Fellow rider Casey Stoner said "Whenever the helmet comes off that's not a good sign."Simoncelli lay without moving in the centre of the track, causing the race to be immediately red flagged for safety reasons. When medics arrived, he was in cardiac arrest and they fought to resuscitate him in the ambulance and medical centre. Simoncelli died from his injuries at 16:56 local time.Known for his aggressive attacking style, Simoncelli had enjoyed a run of success in Moto GP despite his status as a relatively new rider on a satellite bike and was predicted by many to be a rising star of the sport. His death is a blow to the Moto GP world.The official Moto GP statement is as follows:"On Sunday, 23 October, during the MotoGP race at the Sepang International Circuit, San Carlo Honda Gresini's Italian rider Marco Simoncelli suffered a serious accident wherein he sustained critical injuries."The race was stopped immediately with the red flag and Simoncelli was transported by ambulance to the circuit medical centre where the medical staff worked to resuscitate him."The death is the first in Moto GP since Japan's Daijiro Katoh died in his home race in 2003 and follows the death of Japanese rider Shoya Tomizawa in the 2010 inaugral Moto2 season.  Edwards also fell from his bike and sustained a dislocated shoulder, Rossi remained onboard.Investigators in Nepal have blamed the crash of a DeHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter near Mount Everest in October last year on pilot error. Eighteen of the nineteen on board were killed when Yeti Airlines Flight 103 struck a rock at the side of the runway at Lukla Airport and caught fire.The only survivor of the crash was the aircraft's captain. Twelve Germans, four Nepalis and two Australians were killed. The flight had departed from Katmandu and was attempting to land at Lukla, which is at an elevation of 9,200 feet (2,800 meters), and has a sheer drop at the runway's end.The report says the pilots had underestimated deteriorating weather conditions during approach, and had attempted landing after entering a thick patch of fog. Investigators examined the crash site and interviewed eyewitnesses before producing the report, which has been submitted to the government.Kevin Anderson, correspondent for the BBC, reports Mount Merapi is erupting. Reporter Hans van den Broek in Java told the BBC that Mount Merapi is erupting, just about 40 km from where he is.It has been rumbling and spewing ash for some time, but the BBC correspondent said that this is the real thing.China began mourning ceremonies for the major earthquake that struck Sichaun a week ago throughout the country, including its major cities and diplomatic missions outside the country. The government's State Council previously ordered a three-day period of mourning starting Monday. All Chinese flags were also ordered to half-mast in China and its missions. All public entertainment was ordered to be suspended, in addition to the Olympic torch relay being suspended by the Ningbo Organizing Committee for the same three days of mourning. At 2:28 PM, exactly a week after the initial earthquake, people throughout China held three minutes of silence with heads bowed, and government officials stood outside the government headquarters. Traffic came to a halt and horns were wailed in memoriam of the now at least 34,000 victims, with some officials reporting 50,000 likely dead. Afterwards in Tiananmen Square in Beijing and the provincial capital Chengdu, Sichuan, people held patriotic events with some shouting "Go! Go! China" in an attempt to boost national morale.A magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred in southern Mozambique near the small farming town of Espungabera near Malvernia just after midnight.The region is comparatively remote, and detailed reports of what has occurred at the epicenter are not yet available. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), damage is expected, but there are no detailed reports at this stage. As of February 23, February 23, 2006 07:13 UST there are no reported injuries. The area is approximately 100 km away from the Zimbabwen border.Residents in the surrounding region have been urged not to return to buildings due to possible aftershocks. The region is home to the East African rift system.The earthquake was felt as far as 800 km away as Johannesburg and Durban, South Africa, and in Zambia. No damage is expected in those countries.Earlier USGS reports had estimated the magnitude at 6.9. In comparison, the recent 2005 Kashmir quake in Pakistan had a magnitude of 7.6.The quake occurred at February 22, 2006 22:19:08 Universal standard time (UST).All passengers and crew from the stricken Canadian cruise ship MS Explorer are safe. Since broadcasting a call for help at approximately 05:24 UTC, a number of vessels in the area have raced to rescue her 156 passengers and crew. Four vessels led by the cruise ship the Endeavour were the first to arrive and pick up the evacuees from lifeboats and RIBs, later being transferred to the Norwegian ship, MS Nordnorge.In less than one hour all passengers and crew, said to be cold but in good health, were safely transferred to the Nordnorge, and that vessel is now heading towards King George Island, three or four hours steaming away. Speaking on the BBC's News 24, the captain of the Nordnorge said that he was heading for the Chilean research station, from where it is expected that all can be flown back to the South American mainland.Off the South Shetland Islands the ship struck an underwater object (believed to be a submerged iceberg ) the Explorer developed a fist sized crack and began taking on water. Initially said to be listing to starboard at 25° the Argentine Coast Guard reports that the list has since increased to 45° and the vessel is expected to sink soon. Concerns now turn to possible environmental concerns and damage. The rescue effort was an international affair involving the coast guards of Argentina, USA, Chile and the UK. The UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency received notification from the US Coast Guard between 5.30-6.00 asking for the Explorer's emergency data plans.The United Kingdom's government weather agency, the Met Office, has put much of the UK on flood alert with severe weather warnings for the majority of England and Wales and much of Northern Ireland. The office has said that a total of ten regions have a greater than eighty percent chance of "severe or extreme weather." These regions are Southwest Scotland, Lothian and Borders, Northern Ireland, Wales, Northwest England, Northeast England, Yorkshire and Humber, the West Midlands, the East Midlands, Southwest England and London and Southeast England. It is possible that Southeast Scotland may also be affected by the severe weather. The Met Office report that "there is a moderate risk of a severe weather event affecting south-eastern Scotland. Rain, heavy at times, will continue during Saturday, giving further accumulations of 20 to 25 mm in places."A total of 63 flood watches and 25 flood warnings have also been issued, in addition to the severe weather warnings. According to a spokesperson for the Environment Agency, "the threat of flooding is likely to increase, we cannot say how serious it might be until the rain has stopped falling."A person experiencing the floods in Wales said that "it is absolute mayhem. The rain has been unbelievable all day. The roads are flooded and it has just been terrible traffic everywhere."At least thirteen people have been killed after torrential rains caused mudslides in Italy on Friday.The mudslides occurred in the city of Messina, located in the northern part of Sicily. The mud blocked rails and road, cut off communications, and destroyed several buildings.Search and rescue teams were using dogs to locate survivors buried beneath the rubble. Around forty people were hospitalised."Most of the dead and seriously injured were in two buildings that collapsed in mudslides," emergency services spokesman Giampiero Gliubizzi told the Agence France-Presse news agency.Over one hundred people were forced to evacuate when mudslides threatened their homes, officials said. Some escaped onto roofs, where they were airlifted by helicopters."I didn't understand what was happening. I was at home and everything started moving.  Then I found myself surrounded by rubble," said a survivor.  Witness reports suggest the depth of the mud reached seven metres (23 feet)  in some areas.Robert Mugabe, the President of the African country of Zimbabwe, denied reports that the country is suffering from a cholera outbreak, saying that doctors have curbed the epidemic. "I am happy to say our doctors are being assisted by others and the WHO [World Health Organisation] have now arrested cholera," he said in a nationally televised address on Thursday, in response to recent calls for Mugabe to step down from office.The Save the Children organisation said, on the other hand, that "if anything is certain in the chaos of Zimbabwe today, it is that the cholera outbreak is not under control."President Mugabe accused Western powers of using the cholera outbreak as an excuse to seek his overthrow. "Because of cholera, Mr Brown, Mr Sarkozy and Mr Bush want military intervention," Mugabe said. "Let's tell them that the cholera cause doesn't exist any more.""Shall we also say that [because] there is mad cow disease, there must be war, Britain must be invaded. Mr. Brown, your head must go for some medical correction," he added in Thursday's televised speech.Mugabe's statement comes in the midst of one of the worst cholera epidemics in the recent history of Zimbabwe that saw over 16,000 cases reported and almost 800 people dead.The Turkish resort of Marmaris was hit by at least 3 bombs and one bomb went off in Istanbul's Bagcilar district on Sunday injuring at least 27 people.  The blasts come two days after four people were injured in a separate bombing in Adana."We heard one of the bombs and it sounded just like a gunshot. The bus had exploded outside a McDonald’s restaurant. We saw its remains: it had been ripped apart," said one witness, Danielle Pearson.The second explosion happened 45 minutes later, in a residential district near the harbour."Ambulances and police cars were going everywhere. The streets were really busy with people running everywhere. Before the explosions people were being typical holidaymakers and just enjoying themselves," added Pearson.  Of the injured, 10 are Britons, all of whom are in hospital, four of whom are in serious condition.A fifth bombing has been reported in the European section of Istanbul.  Six people are reported to have been injured, none seriously.  The bomb was reportedly in a package left near a school.Reports from southern Turkey at 17:16 say that yet another round of bombings have killed three people and injured a score of others.There is no official word on who is responsible for the blasts, but responsibility has been claimed by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).  Other militant groups are warning tourists not to visit Turkey.  "We had warned before, Turkey is not a safe country. Tourists should not come to Turkey" - website of the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (Tak)Tourism is a mainstay of the Turkish economy, bringing millions of dollars of foreign money to the country.  Deterring tourism constitutes a serious threat to jobs for thousands of Turks.Bureaucrats from the British Foreign and Commonwealth office have not advised tourists to leave, but continue to follow events as they unfold - "Ten British nationals have been injured and are in hospital," quoted a spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office, "We have consular staff on the ground." The Foreign Office has set up a telephone hotline for concerned relatives on 020 7008 0000.Earlier today, multiple explosions have occurred in Boston resulting in two confirmed deaths and hundreds injured at Copley Square.  Two explosions within seconds of each other tore through the finish line at the Boston Marathon, approximately four hours after the start of the men's race. Boston Herald reporter and eyewitness Chris Cassidy said it appeared that the first of the two blasts originated from trash cans along the sidewalk which was heavily populated with marathon spectators.A third explosion also occurred at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, however the Boston Police Department are not reporting any casualties at that scene. Area police do not believe the two events are related. President Obama commented on the events saying federal resources were being made available to the Boston local authorities to hold whomever was responsible accountable."I kept running and I heard behind me a loud bang. It looked like it was in a trash can or something. That one was in front of Abe and Louie’s," said the Herald's Cassidy who was participating in the event at the time.Ed Davis from the Boston police informed the media that persons wishing to contact persons at the scene should phone 617-635-4500.  Anyone at the scene who may have information for the authorities should contact the incident line on 1-800-494-TIPS.Reports suggest methane gas was to blame for two explosions in a Russian coal mine which are thought to have left up to twelve miners dead and eighty others unaccounted for. Local officials say at least 41 miners have been injured.The explosions come after calls for coal mines in Russia to improve their poor safety records.Over three hundred miners were underground when the first explosion occurred just prior to midnight on Saturday night and most of them were brought safely to the surface. However, officials report that eleven miners died in the first explosion.Around three hours later a second explosion occurred and authorities on the surface lost contact with a rescue team below. Following the second explosion, an emergency services ministry spokeswoman told the media that rescue operations had been suspended indefinitely. Aman Tuleyev, the governor of Siberia's western Kemerovo region, has taken charge of the rescue operation. Tuleyev said the second blast had caused more injuries and destroyed the main air shaft. He also stated that there was a risk of more explosions."The rescue work will continue when the atmosphere in the mine is restored, but to conduct rescue work now means to send people to their death," he said.  Reports suggest emergency workers are attempting to pump breathable air into the mine.The mine, owned by Russian company Raspadskaya, is the largest underground coal mine in Russia. A worker was killed after part of the mine collapsed in January 2010.At least six fatalities have resulted this afternoon from a bin lorry crashing in the centre of Glasgow, Scotland.The accident occurred at about 1430 UTC today, when the vehicle hit multiple pedestrians on Queen Street, then crashed into Millennium Hotel alongside George Square, located in the city centre. BBC Scotland reporter Laura Bicker reported witness accounts the vehicle "careered out of control" and the driver "slumped over the wheel" when the crash occurred.It is not yet clear how many people have been killed or injured, although Police Scotland have reported "a number of fatalities and people injured", with "all casualties, including the driver of the bin lorry", alternately being taken to Southern General Hospital, Western Infirmary and Glasgow Royal Infirmary. They later said on Twitter at least six people have died and eight people are receiving hospital treatment. Police Superintendent Stewart Carle said at least seven people suffered serious injury, although the total number of those injured may be greater than this. Sky News has reported six fatalities and a larger number of people injured.Superintendent Carle further explained that police will investigate what the force has described as a "major incident" for the rest of the day and overnight, although they do not suspect there was any "sinister" activity behind it. They told the council to leave Christmas lights on to help the investigation; the council had offered to switch them off as a mark of respect. A winter wonderland attraction has been operating in the area this month. Anyone with photos or video is asked to email the police at georgesquareincident@scotland.pnn.police.uk.Social media is abuzz with Scots and their loved ones checking each other are safe, and offering condolences. "Absolutely gutted for the families of the people killed today, to think[...] I could've been killed too is a shock," said one woman, who passed the scene shortly before the crash. She added she had "seen people in body bags" and was reluctant to go to get her train in Queen Street Station "incase I see more bodies". "Genuinely don't care about Xmas shopping now[, I] was getting so stressed over silly things when other people are losing their family... will be thinking of them at Xmas" she said, later telling well-wishers "Thanks so much guys send your good vibes to their families though they're the ones that really need it".Another local woman said she is "stunned" and she had "stood in that exact spot yesterday afternoon. Taking pictures of the lights". She says the city now faces "Another sad Christmas." She was referring to a police helicopter that crashed into a Glasgow pub on November 29 last year. Three on board and seven on the ground were killed.52,000 acres of land in Dallas county were sprayed aerially Thursday evening, in an effort to kill mosquitoes and reduce the spread of the sometimes-deadly West Nile Virus. More planes were slated to treat again on Friday. The state as a whole has seen more than 400 confirmed instances of the illness already this year. Both the city's mayor, David Rawlings, and the county's Judge have executed a state of emergency. Each has rendered his support for the aerial action. The mayor told media, "I cannot have any more deaths on my conscience because we did not take action". However, Rawlings is reserving his statement about the treatments' effectiveness until a later time, to allow opportunity to assess the outcomes of the treatments. Some individuals have voiced fears over whether or not the chemicals might be harmful. One Dallas man told reporters he made no efforts to leave his home on Friday, and turned off his home's air conditioner, in an attempt to safeguard possible chemical threat to his family. Dr. Roger Nasci of the Centers for Disease Control told reporters, "It's something new there that has not been used in quite a number of years." He further stated, "Anything novel comes with that unknown factor."Due to the scope of the problem, the Texas Health Department is intervening to supervise the action and to offset costs. The state's Health Commissioner told media, "This year is totally different from the experience Texas has had in the past". "If it's nuisance mosquitoes, we ask the city or county to pay part of that. But in the midst of this disease outbreak, it’s easier for us to go ahead and do it". Several Beechcraft King Air twin-engine planes sprayed on Thursday evening. The chemical used is synthetic pyrethroid; a specialist participating in the action told media the planes are normally loaded with chemicals just before take off, to minimize light exposure. One application costs approximately US$1 million. Pilots were informed of certain exclusion zones, such as one containing the Preston Hollow home of former US President George W. Bush, and their flight plans factored in such information. The commissioner for the state's department of health services is encouraging citizens to continue applying insect spray repellant while outdoors. The state has had seventeen West Nile-related deaths this year.Reports from Friday morning indicated no county residents had been medically treated for reactions. The county's judge told media he hadn't expected any medical reactions to the chemicals used.  East Dallas residents were reported that morning in ordinary outdoor exercise activities.At least eight cars and a tanker have crashed on U.S. Route 27 near West Palm Beach, Florida. At least five people have been injured and no fatalities were been reported.A gasoline tanker was in an accident with a flat-bed semi when several vehicles collided with the tanker. At least one semi has burst into flames.Fire Rescue Capt. Don DeLucia said that "Severe fog might have caused the accident and hampered crews from getting there."Both lanes of traffic were shutdown for several hours.Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.Thursday's assassination of Ms. Bhutto has plunged the Pakistani nation into a situation that many perceive as a crisis, with violent protests across the country. Officials say the violence has also caused tens of millions of dollars in damages. Most of the deaths have occurred in southern Sindh province, which is Ms. Bhutto's political stronghold.The worsening security situation prompted President Musharraf on Saturday to order his security chiefs to deal firmly with violent protesters.Ms. Bhutto was killed when an unknown attacker fired shots at her and then blew himself up as she was leaving an election rally in Rawalpindi on Thursday.Pakistani officials say that Ms. Bhutto's death occurred when the force of the suicide blast crashed her head against a lever on the sunroof of her vehicle. An official investigation is under way, but leaders of Ms. Bhutto's party have rejected the official account of her death as "ridiculous." Ms. Bhutto's senior advisor, Sherry Rehman, says she helped wash the slain politician's body for burial. She alleges the government is trying to cover-up its failure to protect Ms. Bhutto, who was campaigning for January 8 elections."It is very clear, it is running on all the Pakistan TV channels, the footage of an assassin who took clear aim at her with his gun and fired the shot that went through the back of her head and came out the other," she said. "I have seen the bullet wound myself. I was part of the bathing ritual party and she bled to death from that wound."Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Cheema told reporters in Islamabad Saturday that the government's version is based on a medical report and other evidence collected from the scene of the attack."Now, if there is any doubt, if they say that she died of the bullet wounds, we don't mind," he said. "If the Peoples Party's leadership wants, her body can be exhumed and post-mortemed. They are most welcome, but we gave you what the facts are."Pakistani authorities have accused a pro-al-Qaida fugitive tribal leader, Baitullah Mehsud, of ordering Ms. Bhutto's assassination.But a spokesman for Mehsud has denied the militant leader had anything to do with the assassination. Government spokesman Cheema says investigators have collected irrefutable evidence of Mehsud's involvement in the suicide attack on Ms. Bhutto."No criminal would ever accept responsibility of a crime that one has committed. It does not suit him," he said. "And I don't think anybody else has the capability to recruit and carry out such kind of attacks except for those [al-Qaida] people."Pakistan plans to hold parliamentary elections next month. But election officials say that violent unrest across the country sparked by Ms. Bhutto's assassination has undermined preparations for the polls.Another Pakistani opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif, says his party will boycott the elections, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the January 8 date.Ms. Bhutto returned home from eight years of self-imposed exile in October, hoping to become prime minister for a third time. She narrowly escaped a suicide attack on her homecoming rally in Karachi, hours after she landed in Pakistan.Somali pirates have released the MV Sirius Star, the biggest ship ever hijacked, after a ransom payment was made. Five pirates drowned while leaving the 330 metre oil tanker.The vessel was hijacked 500 miles from the Kenyan coast on November 15 with two million barrels of crude oil, worth $100 million. It was then anchored off the coast of Somalia at Haradhere, a coastal town used by pirates.It was released yesterday after a ransom of $3 million was paid by owner Saudi Aramco, significantly less than the $25 million originally demanded. After the money was parachuted in the pirates left the vessel, with all 25 crew unharmed. However, one pirate boat carrying eight pirates and some of the money capsized on its way to shore due to rough weather, and five of the occupants drowned.The Sirius Star, which had been taking oil from Saudi Arabia to the United States, headed to Kenya after release. It anchored in deep waters, and a smaller boat took the crew to shore at Mombasa. The pirate faction involved, one of at least five in the Gulf of Aden, is called the Central Regional Coastguard (CRC). The CRC is also holding Ukranian arms ship MV Faina, with a cargo of 33 T-72 tanks, two cargo ships from Turkey and tugs from Indonesia and Nigeria. Negotiations for the release of all these ships are said to be near to completion.Also released Friday was the Hong Kong-registered MV Delight, an Iranian-chartered vessel carrying 36,000 tons of wheat and a crew of 25. It is unclear if any ransom was paid for the ship, seized in November. The crew are in good health and the cargo ship is headed to a port in Iran.The United Nations (UN) is sharply criticising the government of Myanmar for impounding two airplane loads of food aid under the World Food Programme (WFP) and preventing aid workers from entering the country, calling the action "unprecedented."Paul Risley, a spokesperson for WFP, said that "the food aid and equipment that we managed to get in has been confiscated." The WFP has no choice but to suspend aid, he said. The WFP did, however, announce later today that it would resume aid flights."Three flights were scheduled for Saturday but now we have no choice but to suspend food aid until the food in the warehouse is released for WFP to distribute it," Risley told the BBC. "I emphatically urge the government to live up to the responsibility it has for its people and quickly allow international aid into the entire disaster area," said German chancellor Angela Merkel in an e-mail statement. "Very many people are now dependent on fast aid.""Myanmar should be more responsive to international assistance but we cannot force Myanmar to do it, we have to respect her own decision," said Noppadon Pattma, the foreign minister of Thailand. "But the Myanmar people should be at the centre of considerations.""I call once again upon Myanmar's authorities to lift all restrictions preventing the free dispatch of aid by the most efficient channels," said the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner said in a statement. "The specialized agencies of the United Nations and NGOs must have immediate access to the victims."Ky Luu, the director of the United States' Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance said, "We urge the regime of Burma [Myanmar] to open up access to all humanitarian actors," at a press conference yesterday."The delta region is known as the country's granary and the cyclone has hit before the harvest. If the harvest has been destroyed this will have a devastating impact on food security in Myanmar," said the aid group Action Against Hunger. Friday afternoon, US National Security Council spokesperson Gordon Johndroe, announced that the US had been given permission to fly in a C-130 Hercules with aid."We hope that this is the beginning of a long line of assistance from the United States to Burma," Johndroe told the press. "One flight is much better than no flights," Johndroe said. "They're going to need our help for a long time."After travelling in-person to Myanmar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), Ban Ki-moon, has announced that international aid-workers will be granted access to the cyclone-ravaged country.Ban, who met with Senior General Than Shwe — considered the head of Myanmar's military junta — told reporters, "I had a very good meeting with the senior general, particularly on these aid workers.""He has agreed to allow all the aid workers, regardless of nationality. I urged him that it would be crucially important for him to allow aid workers as swiftly as possible and all these aid relief items also be delivered to the needy people as soon as possible."International observers and aid organizations met the news with skepticism and were reported as "puzzled" and "surprised" at the announcement and expressed concerns that the offer was not genuine."We’ll believe it when we see the aid workers on the ground in the delta," Zoya Phan, of the Burma Campaign UK, said. "The generals have a long track record of lying to the UN. If the regime is genuine, then we’ll know within 24 hours, as they’ll take down the army checkpoints which are stopping Burmese and international aid workers getting into the delta.""This discrepancy is a confidence gap that has to be verified, that has to be reconciled," said the ASEAN secretary general, Surin Pitsuwan. "Whether the Sunday pledging conference will be successful or not depends on the ability to reconcile the difference."The UN says that over a million people are still in dire need of food, water, shelter and medical supplies, while the official Myanmar position is that "the emergency phase of the operation is over.""Seeing is believing," said Tom Casey of the United States Disaster Assistance Response Team to reporters in Washington. "We certainly will continue to test that by pushing for visas for our DART team, among others, and hopefully we'll see a change in behavior." US aid workers are still awaiting visas before they can enter Myanmar. Team leader William Berger was given a tour of the affected region along with a briefing, though he was not allowed to give his own assessment.File:RAAF-Roundel.svgThe names of nine Australian service personnel who died Saturday in a helicopter crash near the village of Aman Dray on the Indonesian island of Nias have been released by the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The tragedy is the worst naval flying accident in Australian history.The Royal Australian Navy lost Lieutenant Mathew Davy and Lieutenant Paul Kimlan from the Australian Capital Territory, Lieutenant Matthew Goodall, Petty Officer Stephen Slattery and Leading Seaman Scott Bennett from New South Wales, and Lieutenant Jonathan King from Queensland.The Royal Australian Air Force lost Squadron Leader Paul McCarthy from Western Australia, Flight Lieutenant Lyn Rowbottom and Sergeant Wendy Jones from Queensland.The bodies have not yet been removed from the wreckage.Two other men who were onboard survived the accident are currently being treated for fractures on HMAS Kanimbla, which is stationed just off Nias.Australian investigators have left for Indonesia to try to determine the cause of the crash. Witnesses who saw the accident, said the helicopter slammed into the ground nose first. People from the local village tried to help pull the two survivors free, but said the aircraft exploded into a fireball within five or ten minutes of impact, hindering the rescue.Hifikepunye Pohamba, the president of the southern African country of Namibia, declared a state of emergency in in the country on Tuesday after heavy flooding killed 92 and displaced 5,032 since January."It is with a heavy heart that I declare an emergency for the north-central and north-eastern parts of Namibia," the president said to reporters. "Crop fields are submerged in water and I send out an urgent appeal to the international community for assistance [...] as the current flood is worse than a year ago and could be one of the worst in recent memory."100,000 children were unable to attend classes due to the disaster, which closed 218 schools.Severe flooding occurred in Namibia about the same time last year, when 42 people were killed by the disaster.This year's floods appear to be worse, as President Pohamba stated that the Zambezi River had reached 7.1 metres, compared to last year's peak of 5.37 metres.Flooding has also reached neighbouring Angola, where nineteen people have died, according to the Red Cross.NASA has held a memorial ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. All seven astronauts were killed when their spacecraft broke up on re-entry over Texas on February 1, 2003, 16 minutes prior to scheduled landing time at Florida. Columbia had been damaged by a chunk of loose foam during takeoff 16 days earlier.NASA officials, astronauts, schoolchildren and family members attended the ceremony, which was held just miles from Columbia's intended landing site. Approximately 200 people attended the event, held at the Kennedy Space Center's Space Mirror Memorial to all 24 astronauts killed in space disasters. Each was presented with a rose, which was placed in front of a granite memorial bearing the names of the 24.Evelyn Husband-Thompson, widow of commander Rick, who has remarried just three weeks ago, said "This morning, I couldn't stop thinking about Rick and Willie and Kalpana and Dave and Mike and Laurel and Ilan. All of our families went through so much that day. We so miss them, and we will never forget them."44 teenagers from Israel were amongst those present, there in respect to astronaut Ilan Ramon. Some came from the same school Ramon had attended. 15-year-old Roman Rashchupkin said "He's Israeli, so it's important. He learned in our school."G. Madhavan Nair represented India at the memorial, remembering Indian astronaut Kalpana Chawla. Nair is chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation.Former shuttle commander Bill Readdy commented that, despite a large number of memorials, including one on Mars, "... much more importantly than any physical monument, they're memorialized right here in our hearts," Going on to name them individually, then saying "We'll always miss your easy laughter and your smiling faces. God willing, five years from now, they'll have even more to be proud of us about as we take even longer strides ... back to the moon and onward toward Mars. May God bless the crew of Columbia."NASA boss Michael Griffin was amongst several people who commented on the dangerous nature of spaceflight. He proceeded to read a letter from United States President George W. Bush praising the astronauts, which was then presented to Husband-Thompson. "Space exploration is a dream deeply rooted in humanity, and the seven brave astronauts of Columbia sacrificed their lives so the rest of mankind could realize that dream," said Bush's letter. "They assumed great risk so they could understand what lies beyond the heavens. We are grateful for their service and they will be always be cherished."Griffin also noted the importance of learning from mistakes, adding "Americans don't quit and we won't quit. We'll never quit," and that "not quitting has high costs."It wasn't the only such anniversary around this time. The 41st anniversary of the Apollo 1 fire was on Sunday, and Monday saw the 22nd anniversary of the Challenger disaster.NASA has issued a report on survivability during the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, entitled "Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report".  Although the report finds the accident was impossible to survive, it still faulted a number of design issues with the astronauts' equipment.The accident investigation report was released in 2003, the year of the crash.  During launch on January 16, the spacecraft's wing was holed when a chunk of foam detached and struck it.  The shuttle then broke up on re-entry on February 1 over Texas, killing the seven on board.This new report reveals details of what happened to the astronauts during the accident sequence, although some parts have remained confidential to the victims' families. The report reveals that within seconds of the breakup commencing the crew became unconscious due to the rapid depressurization and that they never regained consciousness prior to their deaths.The report notes that the cabin began spinning wildly, causing some of the astronauts' helmets to come off.  The report noted that most on board were secured only by lap harnesses that offered no restraint to the upper body and were not designed to cope with sideways motion, meaning "lethal trauma" was caused by the rotation.  However, the report was unable to determine whether the astronauts had died from oxygen deprivation or the extreme nature of their injuries.The pressure suits the crew wore, introduced after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, were criticised as the crew could not keep their visors down throughout re-entry due to a design limitation that would have caused excess levels of oxygen to be present had they done so, leaving the suits unsealed.  The gloves also made many tasks difficult or impossible.  When the accident occurred, three people were not wearing gloves, one was not wearing a helmet, and none had their visors down.  The helmets also did not conform to the heads of the wearers.Upon disintegration, the occupants were exposed to extreme heat and high friction from re-entry.  The astronauts likely died very quickly, and were probably dead by the time Columbia broke apart. The report added that although the crew all wore parachutes, they had to be activated by the crew — impossible as they were unconscious.  The report concluded that future spacecraft require sturdier construction and better restraints, while safety devices should be automatic.  NASA is designing better suits and helmets.LOS ANGELES — A commuter van (Van Pool No. 36) from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) plunged 200 feet into a ravine in the Angeles National Forest this morning. The van was carrying ten people: six JPL employees, two NASA employees, and two private contractors. They are identified as: Javier Bautista: Regular Substitute DriverCheryl Lynn Allworth: Executive Secretary in JPL's Space Experiments Systems SectionDorothy M. Forks: JPL Human ResourcesPeter RoblesHelga Maria WurmJane F. Galloway: JPL Business ManagerKerri Lynn Agey: Contractor for JPL Security ServicesChristopher ButtsJim KitaharaDavid MyersThree of the passengers -- Forks, Galloway, and Agey -- lost their lives; the remaining seven sustained various levels of injury, including one passenger suffering critical injury, according to authorities. All victims were airlifted to local area hospitals.According to witnesses who reported the crash, the van simply drove off the side of Angeles Forest Highway. Despite the presence of fog during the accident, the California Highway Patrol believes that this was not a factor. The CHP has said that the investigation into the crash may take two to three days before the cause is known.JPL spokesperson D.C. Agle confirmed that the van was from the facility. Initially, JPL refrained from commenting, but JPL security was spotted at the site shortly after the incident occurred.The Angeles Forest Highway is a two-lane mountain road considered a commuter route for many residents of the Antelope Valley including Palmdale and Lancaster residents. It is an alternative to get to Interstate 210, rather than taking the heavily traveled Antelope Valley Freeway (California State Route 14).A complex series of events, including a five month-old computer error, was responsible for the battery failure that led to the loss of NASA's Mars Global Surveyor last year, an internal review board says. Findings from a preliminary report released on Friday say that while NASA controllers followed procedures while operating the craft, the procedures did not cover the types of errors that occurred.According to NASA, on November 2, 2006, the Global Surveyor was ordered to perform a routine adjustment of its solar panels. However, the Global Surveyor reoriented to an angle that exposed one of its two batteries to direct sunlight. The battery overheated, which led to the depletion of both batteries. An incorrect setting in antenna orientation prevented Global Surveyor from relaying its status to NASA controllers. Its preprogrammed systems did not take into account the need to maintain a thermally safe orientation.That was the last communication that NASA controllers had with the spacecraft.The Global Surveyor was the first US mission to Mars in twenty years, For ten years, the craft returned detailed information to NASA scientists providing new insights, including evidence that appeared to show the presence of water on Mars and identification of deposits of water-related minerals, which led to selection of a Mars rover landing site."The loss of the spacecraft was the result of a series of events linked to a computer error made five months before the likely battery failure," said Dolly Perkins, board chairperson and deputy director-technical of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.The board concluded that NASA controllers had followed procedures, but that the procedures did not adequately cover the type of errors that occurred. In its final report, the board will offer recommendations applicable to future missions."We are making an end-to-end review of all our missions to be sure that we apply the lessons learned from Mars Global Surveyor to all our ongoing missions," said Fuk Li, Mars Exploration Program manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The Global Surveyor was the longest operating spacecraft at Mars and had lasted four times longer than expected.In an afternoon press conference, Erie County Executive Joel Giambra announced that at least 300 United States National Guard troops will assist in the cleanup of the "Friday the 13 snow storm" in Buffalo the past weekend and "that possibly more troops" will be called in to help. It is estimated that at least 30 million tons of trees and other debris from the storm will have to be moved from the streets of cities all over the Western New York region. At least 150 troops came to WNY on Monday with lifts and dumptrucks."[The debris is] massive, absolutely massive. The idea is to get it off the streets as soon as possible. That`s our priority right now," said Giambra in a press conference this afternoon. Giambra was at the Eastern Hills Mall which the National Grid Power Company is using as a staging area for all the storm repairs needed in WNY. The mall is still without power as is an estimated 215,000 people and businesses throughout the region. Power may not be back on in many areas until Sunday or Monday of next week. Originally, nearly 400,000 people lost power during the storm.At least 6 people have died due to storm related injuries or incidents. Three died from being poisoned by carbon monoxide when they left power generators running in their homes. One pedestrian was killed by a falling tree limb and two persons were killed in car accidents related to the heavy snowfall.Kentucky's National Guard have been mobilized in the aftermath of what the governor called "the biggest natural disaster that this state has ever experienced".An ice storm hit the U.S. state on Tuesday 27 January, bringing down power lines, freezing mains water supplies, bringing down trees and killing at least seven. More than 500,000 homes and business in the state remain without power, with utilities warning that it may take two weeks to restore supplies. State officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have been issuing generators to the most vulnerable.The National Guard are visiting homes in Kentucky to check that residents are well. At Murray State University the campus lost power and the water was turned off to stop pipes bursting. Students were moved to shelters. The state of Tennessee was also affected, with 265 people staying in shelters.States of emergency have been declared in 92 of Kentucky's 120 counties, leading Governor Steve Beshear to call FEMA for assistance. FEMA aid is available to states that have suffered for damages and extraordinary costs above $7.4 million.Ice storms are caused when a layer of warm air is caught between two layers of cold air. Water in the frozen layer is melted by the warmer layer but is then reduced to below freezing by the second cold layer. It falls as water, but freezes on contact with the ground, power lines and trees, leading to a build up of ice.On June 7, Mike Svonavec, the owner of the land in Somerset County, Pennsylvania where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed on September 11, 2001 has a US$10 million price tag for his property which is sought by the group, Families of Flight 93 and the United States National Park Service, (NPS) for building a memorial dedicated to those on the plane. Svonavec also placed a box on the crash site temporary memorial, where visitors can leave a "donation" to pay for his asking price for the land as well as the cost of  providing security at the site.The NPS has covered the donation box with a trash bag and told Svonavec in a letter to remove it by the end of Friday June 8, but Svonavec said that he will not remove the box."I have no intentions of removing the box from my property. My only plans are to try to cooperate with the Park Service with regard to the sale of the property," said Svonavec.Svonavec accused the NPS of trying to take over his property after they placed the bag over the box."It's just unbelievable to my mind that that's the direction they would take, taking control of the property like a guest would at your house," added Svonavec."The bottom line is we feel the National Park Service can't effectively carry out our mission without exercising the exclusive use and control of the site as provided for in our agreement with the property owners," said Joanne Hanley who is the Superintendent of the memorial.Although NPS tour guides are telling tourists and others who visit the memorial, they are shocked to learn that the money they donate is going to Svonavec and not the memorial. "They're alarmed that they may have given their money to something that they didn't want to give their money to," said one of the 43 guides who volunteer at the memorial, Donna Glessner.The land is currently under contract with the NPS and the memorial is allowed to be on the land according to an act of the United States Congress who in 2002 authorized the memorial to be placed on the land.Currently, the U.S. National Park Service only owns approximately 60 acres of the land. PBS Coals Inc. owns 864 acres of the land and Svonavec owns 273 acres. The entire field is nearly 2,000 acres.As the death toll for the recent earthquake in Asia has passed 30,000, countries around the world are beginning to send aid. The sponsors of the relief are listed below, along with the amounts offered as of 8 October 2005.The European Union executive branch has pledged about $3,600,000.The United Kingdom has pledged £100,000 (about $176,000), as well as fifty aid workers and three search and rescue teams.Germany has made €50,000 (about $60,600) available for Pakistan and sent rescue experts of the Technisches Hilfswerk.France is sending a rescue team for Pakistan, as well as "any assistance which Pakistan could need," says Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy.Ireland is currently offering €1,000,000 (about $1.2 million).Japan has sent rescue experts, and pledged to send aid stuffs which cost about 25,000,000 JPY (about US$ 250,000).The United Nations has sent a team to Pakistan.Other sponsors include Turkey, Greece, China, and Iran, as well as the Medecins Sans Frontieres and the International Committee of the Red Cross.British rescue workers from the International Rescue Corps located additional survivors at Marghalla Towers on Sunday morning using specialist equipment, and are hopeful that more people will be brought out alive.A NATO aircraft, a Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod MR2, crashed in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan today, killing 14 British servicemen. There is no indication that hostile fire was involved. The crash came a day after fighting across the volatile south killed nine Afghan policemen, at least 13 suspected Taliban and a British soldier.British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the incident would "distress the whole country", adding that the mission in Afghanistan is "vital". "Our thoughts go out immediately to the families of those who have died," he said. "British forces are engaged in a vital mission in Afghanistan and this terrible event starkly reminds us of the risk that they face daily." The "aircraft was supporting a NATO mission. It went off the radar and crashed in an open area in Kandahar" province, about 12 miles west of Kandahar city, said Maj. Scott Lundy, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force.The British Ministry of Defense said the dead included 12 Royal Air Force personnel, a Royal Marine and an army soldier.Lundy said "there was no indication of an enemy attack." He gave no other details, but an ISAF statement said the plane's crew reported a technical problem before going down. It also said that "enemy action has been discounted at this stage."However, shortly after the crash, a purported spokesman for the Taliban, Abdul Khaliq, claimed responsibility. "We used a Stinger missile to shoot down the aircraft," he said.British Secretary of State for Defence Des Browne said: "This is dreadful and shocking news. I know that the people of Britain will join me in sending our deep condolences to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives. "At this stage all the indications are that this was a terrible accident and not the result of hostile action," he added. Haji Eisamuddin, a local tribal elder, told The Associated Press by phone that the plane's wreckage was burning in an open field."I can see three, four helicopters in the sky, and coalition forces are also arriving in the area," he said.People can call a special helpline on 08457 800 900 if they are worried about relatives.Several NATO oil tankers were set on fire in the Punjab province of Pakistan, and four policemen were killed in a gunfight with unknown gunmen yesterday, reports say. The Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) news service attributes the attack to the Taleban.The incidents occurred in the town of Talagang. Aslam Tareen, the regional police chief, said that "around a dozen" tankers were set on fire after being attacked with rocket-propelled grenades. "Later on, they exchanged intensive fire with the police and killed four of our officers while two more were injured," Tareen said, adding that a petrol station nearby the oil tankers also caught fire.DPA says the attack was the deadliest on NATO supply convoys in the province. Close to three quarters of all oil, food, and military supplies to landlocked Afghanistan first pass through Pakistan.The man who died while riding the Expedition Everest roller coaster at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom indeed had prior medical conditions, Orlando, Florida officials say.The Orange County medical examiner determined in a Tuesday autopsy that 44-year-old Navarre, Florida man Jeffery Reed had an existing heart condition.The Walt Disney World website for the ride says: Similar signs exist at the entrance to the ride.The man was given CPR after being pulled off the ride unconscious, and was taken in an ambulance to Celebration Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Reed was believed to have been conscious at least 50 seconds before the ride ended, when a camera took a picture of him. Cameras are sometimes placed on roller coasters so that riders can buy a photo of themselves as they go down a hill.Orlando Sentinel columnist Mike Thomas commented, that "when millions of people walk through your parks every year, it is a statistical certainty that some of them will die. When that happens on a ride, we often tell you about it under a banner headline. It becomes a worldwide story. But if you did the math, you would find that per capita no more people die in Disney than in any other large gathering place."A strong odor of natural gas permeated through parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Jersey City early this morning.  Authorities assert that there is no cause for alarm and assure the air quality, though smelly, is safe enough to breathe.  New York City's Health Department, the Coast Guard, and Con Ed are still on the scene.In a press conference, Mayor Michael Bloomberg says that a small gas leak at Bleeker St. and Sixth Av. "could not account for a smell so pervasive throughout the city".  PATH trains were temporarily suspended from Hoboken, New Jersey, to the 33rd St. terminus, and an MTA control tower at West 4th St. was also temporarily shut down."Sensors do not show any high concentration of natural gas that would cause concern" continued Bloomberg.  "We want to take our time and make sure we don't get the wrong information.  We cannot speculate, but these are the facts: the smell is there, we don't know the source, and it doesn't appear to be dangerous."Some buildings in Midtown Manhattan were evacuated as a safety precaution, and HVAC systems in the area have been brought back online.  Jersey City EMTs report that seven people have been taken to hospital, but it is unclear if it is a direct result of mercaptanline inhalation.WINS-AM reporter Juliett Poppa has been reporting along 34th St., commenting that the odor was most noticeable around Fifth Av., but has now dissipated.  Radio announcer Lee Harris added that the odor was noticeable even in their Broadway and 57th St. studios.  During an interview on air, a Con Ed spokesman said that no gas leak has been found."We've had reports as far north as 96th St. on the West Side and 130th on the East" said one NYC 311 operator  (This was during this journalist's report of a gas smell at 205th Street.)Natural gas supplied for domestic and commercial use is odorless.  Mercaptan is added to give natural gas its distinctive smell as an aid to leak detection.The Spanish word "tortuga" means "turtle."  But in the wake of the New Orleans disaster, the USS Tortuga is helping other animals.For nearly two weeks now, sailors from Tortuga's repair division have devoted much of their time during this disaster relief operation to ensure the health and comfort of displaced pets.September 4th, just after the ship moored to a pier at Naval Support Activity (NSA) New Orleans, HT1(SW) Mark Hanley and DC1(SW) Antony Graves gathered materials from the repair shop on board to construct a kennel along the levee. The facility they made soon became a popular shelter for the homeless animals of the storm.Tortuga's search and rescue team brought aboard more than 170 displaced citizens during this past week, providing them with food, water, medical aid and a place to sleep.Tortuga's makeshift kennel, named ‘Camp Milo & Otis,' has housed as many as 90 dogs, eight cats, one rabbit, one guinea pig, a pair of parakeets and a flightless pigeon during the past week of operation.Currently, there are 14 dogs that remain in Tortuga's care, as many of the other pets have been taken to animal shelters in the area for extra medical attention, or been claimed by their owners upon arrival to Tortuga. The pets that Tortuga has registered have all been in the hands of professional veterinarians assigned to provide expert medical attention to the members of Camp Milo & Otis.Dr. Kelly Crowdis and Dr. Latina Gambles, both from Tuskegee University and Christian Veterinary Missions, have treated many of the pets for infection, dehydration, malnourishment and broken bones at the Camp during the past week.“The animals were bathed and assessed before physical interaction with the sailors,” said Dr. Crowdis. “They've been given immunizations, antibiotics and medications based on their medical needs.”Dr. Crowdis added, “What these sailors have done on their own has been such a heart-warming thing. As an animal lover, it is so comforting to know that everyone cares about the animals in addition to the human lives rescued from the storm. I'm very pleased with these guys for taking the initiative to construct this kennel.”Graves, Hanley and other members of their division have consistently bathed, fed, walked and given special attention to every dog, every day.“We play with them,” said Hanley. “We take them out of their kennels to give them attention every day. And we'll continue to do that for as long as our ship's mission keeps us here.”September 11th, the Agricultural Center at Louisiana State University donated supplies to “Camp Milo & Otis” in support of Tortuga's efforts to help the animal victims.”We got medical supplies, bowls, food, cages, leashes, collars, toys, cat litter and cleaning supplies from these people yesterday,” said Graves. “It's nice to know that so many people out there have heard about what our ship is doing, and responded by donating so much to support us the best they can.”A photo gallery of unclaimed pets is on the USS Tortuga's web site.As part of disaster plans, the Department of Homeland Security has also deployed Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams to provide medical care to pets and livestock, as well as provide any needed veterinary medical care for search and rescue dogs.There are over 3,850 animals being sheltered around the state.  If someone is looking for a pet they should contact their nearest Humane Society or go online to http://www.petfinder.org// .

In the December 23 annoncement, NASA advised that the 400-meter wide asteroid has a 1 in 300 chance of colliding with earth.  As scientists gather more data on 2004 MN4, the probability of collision with earth is expected to decrease.The level of impact risk is measured in terms of Torino Impact Hazard Scale, and the MN4's score was initially 2 out of 10. 2004 MN4 is expected to come closest to the Earth on April 14, 2029.A heat wave in the upper Midwest has people trying to stay cool, while the National Guard is activated by Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to fight a new wildfire in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.  Temperatures cracked 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in St. Paul, Minnesota, and reached a record-breaking 96 degrees Fahrenheit (35.5 Celsius)  in Duluth, Minnesota.Smoke was spotted Friday afternoon in the wilderness area about one mile southwest of Seagull Lake.  This area of the 1 million acre wilderness was hit by a severe windstorm in 1999, which killed millions of trees, increasing concern about the future threat of wildfires.Firefighters are not yet on the ground, as the fire is located in a remote area inaccessible by trails or lakes.  Helicopters have been called in to begin suppression efforts immediately.Jean Bergerson, spokesperson for the Minnesota Inter-agency Fire Center, described the blaze as "well over 1,000" acres in size.  The cause of the fire is not yet known.UPDATE:Saturday, June 17, 2006 The flames continue to rage in Northern Minnesota as the fire expands by the hour, now engulfing more than 6,000 acres of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, as reported by the Minneapolis Star Tribune today.  The purported cause of the fire is a lightning strike.There are now over 60 firefighters stationed on the ground near the fire, though it is still considered too dangerous to combat the blaze directly.This is the largest fire to take place in Minnesota in years, and has now spread to within 3 miles of the Gunflint Trail, though the trail may be protected by controlled burn zones put in place in recent years by the US Forest Service.  Govenor Tim Pawlenty plans a fly-over of the afflicted area.Nearly 200 people are confirmed dead and approximately 2600 are ill in a central Haitian cholera outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and United Nations (UN). Haitian officials place the death toll at 194 deaths with 2,364 people being infected.According to CDC officials Dr. Rob Quick and Dr. Carleene Dei an eleven man team is being sent to Haiti to investigate and determine the best course of action for the country. The USAID has said that they will provide supplies to set up treatment centers and have already provided 300,000 oral re-hydration kits and water purification kits.A majority of the reported cases are in the Central Plateau and Artibonite regions located just north of the earthquake ravaged capital, Port-Au-Prince. Officials fear that the disease could spread to the capital city if not brought under control. It has been reported that many people are flooding the St. Nicolas hospital, which is the main medical facility in St. Marc, for treatment, causing pandemonium outside the gate. An aid worker who visited the hospital called it a "horror scene", while another worker, David Darg, of Operation Blessing International wrote "The courtyard was lined with patients hooked up to intravenous drips. It had just rained and there were people lying on the ground on soggy sheets, half-soaked with feces."The cholera outbreak developed after recent rains flooded the Artibonite River, however it is not certain whether this was the cause of the outbreak. According to the CDC, cholera is "an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae." They also said that "Approximately one in 20 infected persons has severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these persons, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours." Cholera is passed on through contaminated water.So far at least 23 people, all civilians, are reported dead when a bomb exploded on a bus in the town of Buttala in Sri Lanka. Nearly 70 have been injured. Reports say that there were at least 50 people on the bus, many of them school children."Twenty-three people were killed and 67 wounded. They are all civilians. The terrorists were desperate in that area and are now targeting civilians," said Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, a spokesman for the country's military. Police also say that someone fire shots at the bus after it exploded.It is not yet known whether or not the bomb was on the bus, or placed in close proximity of it.Two nuclear power plants in Nebraska, US, near the city of Omaha, remain on alert following flooding. One is shut down pending floodwater receding.The Fort Calhoun nuclear reactor - 19 miles north from Omaha - has been shut down since April 9 partly due to flooding from the Missouri River. It sits nearly two feet below the current river level. This month, the plant lost power needed to cool the spent fuel pool for a short time after a fire. The current flooding with record water releases is expected to stay at high levels until August, so that another plant, Cooper Nuclear Station, to the south and further from Omaha, will soon be concerned, too.On Wednesday the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said that it was keeping an eye on the situation and both plants have taken action for protection against the rising floodwaters.A food crisis is threatening three other countries in the region of Niger — a country facing severe food shortages after drought and plagues of locusts — the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has warned.The three — Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania — have been affected by drought and plagues of locusts that engulfed the Sahel region of West Africa last August.About 6 million are short of food and require food aid: 3.5 million from Niger; 1.1 million from Mali; 750,000 from Mauritania; and 500,000 from Burkina Faso. The United Nations — which has a Consolidated Appeal for West Africa of just under £196 million US dollars in aid for the region this year — is expecting to feed 250,000 people shortly. In May, OCHA made an additional flash appeal for $16,191,000 US dollars.Over the past few weeks, the media has shown graphic images of the situation in Niger. Jan Egelend, OCHA Under-Secerary General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, claims that the situation in the region prior to this was largely ignored by the international community, saying that: "Over the last few days, the world has finally woken up, but it took graphic images of dying children for this to happen."The great-granddaughter of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela has died in a car crash following a concert to open the World Cup.The Nelson Mandela Foundation released a statement which said that thirteen-year-old Zenani Mandela, who celebrated her birthday on June 9, died in a single vehicle accident and that no one else was injured. The statement continued: "The family has asked for privacy as they mourn this tragedy."The driver of the vehicle of which Zenani Mandela was a passenger has been arrested and charged with drunk driving. He may also face culpable homicide charges, according to police.South Africa has a poor road safety record and ranks ninth in the world for traffic fatalities. Traffic safety is feared to be a threat of injury to supporters to the World Cup.A wildfire in the Ashley National Forest has been blamed for three deaths and has led to the evacuation of about 500 residents of the communities of Whiterocks, Farm Creek, Paradise and Tridell in eastern Utah.The fire broke out on Friday, June 29 at around 9:00 a.m. local time in Duschene county, north of Neola by state route 121, and proceeded to spread westward into Uintah county. To date, the cause of the wildfire is unknown. An early report by public safety officials claimed it was caused by a faulty power line or transformer. However, a later announcement by Moon Lake Electric Association CEO Grant Earl disputed this.By Saturday morning, the fire had spread across approximately 46 square miles of land and been blamed for three fatalities: George Houston, his son Tracy Houston, and Roger Roberson, all from Farm Creek. Eleven year old Duane Houston, George's grandson, was able to escape the fire with only minor injuries.The communities of Whiterocks, Farm Creek, Paradise and Tridell, consisting of approximately 500 local residents, were evacuated by Sunday, and at least five homes are known to have been destroyed. Those without family or friends to provide lodging have been relocated to the Ute Indian Tribe's auditorium in Fort Duchesne and Union High School in Roosevelt.The Federal Emergency Management Agency became involved in the management of fire fighting efforts on Sunday, and a specialized regional wildland fire team, the Rocky Mountain Type One Management Team, had begun to converge on the Uinta Basin to assist with the firefighting, along with about 100 members of the Utah National Guard.Reports that same day claimed the fire was 5% contained, but that it had split into at least two separate smaller fires. Authorities declared their intention to prevent the fire from moving eastwards into Dry Fork Canyon and the town of Tridell.An aeroplane crash in the Asian country of Nepal has resulted in the death of all nineteen of the vehicle's occupants. The aircraft was travelling around the region of Mount Everest, carrying sightseers.The crash occurred shortly after contact with the aircraft was lost, which was around 0730 NPT today. Bimlesh Lal Karna, Tribhuvan International Airport rescue section leader, informed Agence France-Presse: "All 19 people have died. The Buddha Air-103 was returning from a mountain flight when it crashed into Kotdada Hill".On person onboard the plane, police said, survived the crash on a hill near Kathmandu, but died later in a hospital. Among the victims were ten Indian, two US, and one Japanese passenger; the other three passengers and the three crew were Nepali.According to police, an investigation of the cause of the crash has been started. A black box recorder was found at the scene in the hours after the accident. When the crash occurred, weather conditions in the region were poor, with fog and heavy rain.The plane had been on of the country's 'mountain flights', which transport tourists over the Everest region, allowing them to observe various peaks from the airplane windows.Two passenger trains collided head-on in the area of Sloterdijk in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, local authorities have confirmed. One 68-year-old woman died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident. At least 117 were also reportedly injured in the crash.One of the two trains involved in the crash was en route from Den Helder to Nijmegen while the second was going between Uitgeest and the Dutch capital. Neither train derailed. Reports suggest the two trains, one a regional stop system vehicle and the other an inter-city rail service, were not seriously damaged in the incident yesterday at 1830 CEST (1630 UTC).The exact number of people injured varies by source; BBC News Online has reported approximately 125 on Saturday and 117 Sunday, while the London Stock Exchange reported a figure of 121 experiencing minor, severe or very severe injuries yesterday. Passengers were assisted out of the train carriages, with those injured transported to hospital.Speaking on behalf of police, Ed Kraszewski informed Netherlands news network AT5 of 51 individuals being "seriously or very seriously injured" and another seventy suffering minor injuries. Kraszewski commented on how the spaciousness of one of the train's carriages possibly contributed to the passengers' injuries and spoke of the assumption that "many people were thrown around the train by the crash; against walls, seats and other people", adding that neck injuries and broken bones were among the kinds of injury experienced.How the two trains ended up travelling towards each other is uncertain at this stage. An investigation into the accident's cause has commenced.Rail services have been disrupted as a result of the incident, with trains travelling between Amsterdam Centraal and Schiphol Airport being suspended.An employee of Network Rail, the company that owns and maintains the British railway infrastructure, has been arrested in connection with the Grayrigg derailment in Cumbria, in the north of England, which left one passenger dead in February of this year.The Virgin Pendolino service from London to Glasgow derailed at 20:15 GMT on February 23 as it passed over a set of points which an interim report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch found were missing components and were in a poor condition. A spokesman for the British Transport Police said that the 46-year-old man from Preston was arrested on Wednesday and has been released on police bail until October 31.Network Rail were unable to comment on the arrest.On Saturday night, a propeller plane in Nevada, United States crashed following departure from Henderson Executive Airport, near Las Vegas, according to investigators. At the time, there were reportedly four people on board; according to investigators, one was pronounced dead at the crash site, with the other three being taken to a nearby hospital. Another later died. A bystander was also subsequently injured.Officials said the single-engine propeller plane, a Beechcraft Sierra, was flying to Gillespie Field airport, located near San Diego in El Cajon, California. Following take off, the plane turned back with a mechanical problem, intending to land at Henderson. It crashed in a desert area located about half a mile (likely less than a kilometer) to the south of the airport, and then caught fire. A bystander attempted to aid the passengers, and was later hospitalized for smoke inhalation.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began investigations of the crash of the place, which was built in 1977. Keith Holloway, an NTSB spokesman, told Fox News their investigation could last as long as two years but a preliminary report would likely be available in the next few weeks.1,500 people in the town of Winnemucca, Nevada, United States had to be evacuated this weekend as an 8,000-acre, 55 square mile wildfire burned dangerously close to the town's southern end.The fire threatened homes, businesses and a power substation. Lightning strikes are believed to have started the blaze.Authorities in the western U.S. state of Nevada say near-freezing waters from a ruptured canal have flooded about 800 homes following a powerful winter storm.Authorities east of the city of Reno say a nine-meter-long section of the Truckee Canal broke early Saturday, sending a nearly one-meter-high flood into the small town of Fernley. They say more than 3,000 people have been affected by the flooding, with many evacuated to a local school.There are no reports of any injuries.In neighboring California, the fierce Pacific storm system brought winds of up to 240 kilometers an hour, leaving more than one million people without power Friday.One of the hardest hit areas is the Sierra Nevada mountain region, where the storm turned into an arctic blizzard in the upper elevations. Forecasters say the region will get anywhere from two to three meters of snow by Sunday.Forecasters also say the storm could dump as much as 25 centimeters of rain on parts of southern California.The heavy rains could trigger flash floods and mudslides in areas burned during last year's massive wildfires. Officials have ordered a mandatory evacuation of thousands of homes near Los Angeles.With the announcement Monday of €2 million in new funding from the European Union (EU), the Republic of Djibouti's Ministry of Agriculture hopes to provide some relief to an estimated 25,000 rural inhabitants suffering through severe drought conditions. The money, to be channeled through UNICEF for its water and sanitation program, will be used to develop new wells and improve existing ones.UNICEF is to contribute a further €60,000, as well as technical expertise to the Ministry of Agriculture, who will carry out the bulk of the work.“The two-year water supply project targeting rural districts is very significant since people living in 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle will have access to clean drinking water,” said Joaquin Gonzalez, EU Representative in Djibouti.At the same time, the UN aid agency World Food Program (WFP) indicated that it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to gradually shift Djibouti's reliance on emergency aid to a Food for Work program, which it hopes will assist nomadic herders in Djibouti with long-term sustainability. "What we are trying to do together with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF is, for example to dig wells so that despite drought, these herders will be able to irrigate their fields," said Simon Pluess, WFP spokesman.  "And, together with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, we will try and promote vegetable gardens."Djibouti has survived harsh drought conditions for the past 5 years. Groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation, but has been difficult to exploit and is often contaminated. Almost 50 percent of people in rural Djibouti do not have ready access to properly developed source of drinking water. And, due to the ongoing drought, water availability for livestock is limited. Livestock have shown signs of distress and, subsequently, milk production is down substantially. Nearly half of all families in Djibouti's northwest were forced to migrate to find pasture for their livestock. As the droughts continue, the importance of properly maintained wells has become apparent. “Life is harder and harder for us. Years ago there were more rains and also more pastureland for cattle. Now it is good for us to have functioning wells so that we can keep cattle here,” said Anou Amada, farmer in the village of Andoli.A 2006 survey indicated that only 15 percent of wells in Djibouti were equipped with a protective concrete wall to prevent contamination. Andoli's well is one of many undergoing repair through WFP's Food for Work project.“WFP couldn’t do this alone, so we work with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to dig wells and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for vegetable gardens,” said Benoit Thiry, Director, WFP in Djibouti.When the project is completed in 2008, it will have increased Djibouti's water pump capacity by adding 25 solar-power pumps, which would compliment the current 61 diesel-powered pumps. "The advantage of solar...is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance," said Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist. "We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations. The government’s role in the long term should be as restricted as possible," he added.A fresh, 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck the South Pacific again on Friday. The tremors were felt in Tonga and Samoa, which are still reeling after a stronger earthquake and tsunami struck the area several days earlier.According to the US Geological Survey, the tremors began underwater at 02.46 GMT on Friday, with the epicentre about 242 kilometres off of the Tongan island of Neiafu, at a depth of ten kilometres. The earthquake is among the dozens of aftershocks that occurred in the region since Tuesday's big quake.No damage and casualties from that earthquake have been reported, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not issue a tsunami warning.Experts did not think it likely that the earthquake would cause any tsunamis. "I don't think there is a particular tsunami danger from that earthquake," said seismologist Phil Cummins to the Agence France-Presse news agency.The British energy company BP will be attempting a "top kill" on the leaking Deepwater Horizon oil well by firing a mud and cement mixture into the blowout preventer on the sea floor later this week.  If successful, the oil well will be closed off with cement.  A backup plan in case of failure (there is an estimated 30–40% chance of failure) would be another containment apparatus. BP has been using the oil dispersant corexit to disperse the oil film into small droplets which mix with the seawater.  A riser insertion tube inserted into the largest oil leak site is collecting between 1,360 to 2,000 barrels of oil per day.  Two relief oil wells are also currently under construction for what is hoped will be a permanent solution to the oil spill.  This pair will take about 90 days to complete.$500 million will be forthcoming from BP for the gulf spill's impact on the environment and damage to regional ecosystems as far as where water currents may spread the oil.  BP also put forward a ten-year research plan to study the long-term effects of the oil spill on the environment.Controlled surface oil burns and skimming have removed some of the oil spill.  It is estimated that 5,000 barrels of oil a day are leaking from the ruptured pipe 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below sea level.  A Natural Resources Defense Council marine biologist, Lisa Suatoni, said that only about 7 to 10 percent of oil from the Exxon Valdez spill was cleaned up in 1989.Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal wants an emergency permit for dredges which will contain the pollution. Homeland Security secretary, Janet Napolitano, is seeking viable options which may be more effective and better for the environment. “I am angry and I am frustrated that BP has been unable to stop this well from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading.  We are 33 days into this effort, and deadline after deadline has been missed,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar."This is a complex operation requiring sophisticated diagnostic work and precise execution. As a result, it involves significant uncertainties and it is not possible to assure its success or to put a definite timescale on its deployment." said BP.  "We’re doing things that have never been done before at that kind of depth, so it’s very fluid.  We’re not going to do it until we’re completely sure it’s right."The oil rig Deepwater Horizon suffered a gas explosion and sank April 22, 2010 off the coast of Louisiana resulting in 11 persons missing (and presumed dead) of the 126 on board.  BP and its business vendors were completing a new oil well at the time, constructing a layer of cement in the well to reinforce it, which resulted in the blowout.A strong earthquake hit Chile at approximately at 14:52 local time (1852 UTC) on Friday. The United States Geological Survey first reported it reached a preliminary magnitude of 5.5, and the epicenter was located very close to Pichilemu, a coastal town in the O'Higgins Region. Exact distances were: 102 kilometers to the northwest of Talca; 165km to the southwest of Santiago de Chile and 167km to the south of Valparaíso. The earthquake lasted approximately 30 seconds.  SHOA (Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Army), reported it reached a magnitude of 5.5. USGS updated their information later, and specified the earthquake reached a 5.7 magnitude, with a depth of 10 kilometers, and the epicenter was located 70km at the northwest of Curicó, 85km southwest of Rancagua, 95km south of San Antonio, 140km southwest of Santiago.Wikinews reporter Diego Grez, who was in Santa Cruz at the time of the tremor, reported that the power went out for approximately 30 minutes and people evacuated their houses quickly. In Pichilemu, the power also went out, but came back in a few minutes. Desperate people quickly ran to the now well-known La Cruz Hill.USGS' Did you feel it? users have reported the earthquake was felt in Colina, Santiago (Santiago Metropolitan), Curicó (Maule), Machalí, Rengo, Rancagua (O'Higgins), and Valparaíso (Valparaíso).ONEMI (Chile's National Emergencies Office) has reported no casualties or structural damage; and reported the earthquake was felt between the Metropolitan Region and Bío Bío. The Mercalli scale intensities were: Pichilemu, Constitución and Paredones: V; San Fernando, Santa Cruz, Navidad, Curicó, Río Claro, Linares, Molina, Longaví and Rancagua: IV; San Javier and San Clemente: III; Concepción, Coelemu and Cauquenes: II.The University of Chile Geological Survey reported the epicenter of the earthquake was located 28 kilometers at the south of Pichilemu, and it is most likely an aftershock to the March 11 earthquake. UCGS also reported it reached a magnitude of 5.6, at a depth of 7.3 kilometers.On Friday, on Route 2 in Randolph, New Hampshire, United States, a pickup truck and a group of ten motorcycles collided, the truck catching fire in the process. The incident left seven motorcyclists dead; the official cause of death reportedly was "blunt trauma."  The victims were reportedly members and supporters of the motorcycle club Marine JarHeads MC, which includes both veterans of the United States Marines and their spouses.According to Coös County Attorney John McCormick on Saturday, the truck driver was identified as commercial driver Volodoymyr Zhukovskyy. The pickup had been towing a flatbed trailer.  The deceased victims were officially identified as Michael Ferazzi, Albert Mazza, Desma Oakes, Aaron Perry, Daniel Pereira, and Joanne and Edward Corr. Three other cyclists were hospitalized.After the names of the victims were released, New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu declared flags would be flown at half-mast on Monday — today — in their honor. A memorial was held for the group as part of a Blessing of the Bikes ceremony this weekend in Columbia, New Hampshire. Marine Corps and United States flags were also left at and near the scene of the crash.  As of Saturday the crash was being investigated by both state police and the National Transportation Safety Board, and as of yesterday no arrests nor charges were reported. A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to pay for funeral costs and medical expenses.The new Interstate 35W St. Anthony Falls Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States was opened shortly after 5 AM today.  It replaces a bridge which collapsed last year, killing 13 people.A fire engine and ambulance were first across on each side. In each direction, a line of State Highway Patrol cars was followed by a formation of Department of Transportation construction trucks. A cluster of awaiting vehicles went honking across for a few minutes, then traffic returned to the sparse levels more typical of the pre-dawn period.The September 18 opening was well ahead of the scheduled December 24 goal, earning the contractor, Flatiron-Manson, up to $19.6 million in performance bonuses.The bridge is 189 feet wide, with a main span length of 504 feet and a deck height of over 100 feet above the Mississippi River. Traffic is expected to return to previous levels of 141,000 vehicles per day on the 10 lanes. The accelerated construction (of only 11 months) was accomplished by pouring 120 concrete sections in heated pole barns, and then lifting them all into place via a crane mounted on a river barge. The bridge contains 323 electronic sensors for real-time monitoring of stresses and movement of the bridge components. It is illuminated with white light-emitting diodes.An apartment building located in Bergenfield, New Jersey partially collapsed today around 9:30 a.m. EST. The collapse occurred after an explosion was heard and a cloud of smoke was said to be visible from nearby Manhattan."It was an apartment building, unknown origin for the explosion," stated a police spokesperson located in the city. However, preliminary reports suggest that a gas line may have contributed to the explosion."Thirty families are going to be homeless throughout the holiday period," said Sheriff Leo P. McGuire, referring to the number of families that the building houses. The apartment building appears to be three stories high and firefighters are still trying to put out fires.According to news reports, at least two people have been hospitalized. Eyewitness March Chance had the following to add: "The building is in flames… and there are a lot of ambulances."The Governor of New Jersey Jon S. Corzine was hospitalized Thursday after the vehicle he was riding in crashed into a guardrail on Garden State Parkway. The Governor was on his way to a meeting between the Rutgers University basketball team and radio personality Don Imus.Corzine was riding in the front passenger seat when a red pickup truck drifted onto the shoulder. As the truck corrected itself, a white pickup swerved to avoid it, hitting the motorcade SUV he was riding. Corzine suffered six broken ribs, a broken collarbone, broken sternum, fracture of his lower vertebrae, a broken leg, and a head gash. He is in stable condition following surgery at Cooper University Hospital, but will require more surgery to repair a broken femur that broke through the skin. The trooper driving the vehicle suffered minor injuries.Senate President Richard Codey will serve as governor while Corzine is in the hospital. An aide to Corzine said he was not wearing a seat belt.The Law and Justice Party of Poland, which took power last week, this week removed web pages featuring the results of an investigation into the Smolensk air disaster in Russia in 2010. The cause of the crash, which killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski, is disputed.The flight was carrying high-profile political figures to attend a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, when thousands of Polish prisoners of war and civilians were killed by the Soviets. All 96 on board died. Amongst the dead were First Lady Maria Kaczyńska, several members of the lower parliamentary house known as the Sejm, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer, National Security Bureau head Aleksander Szczygło, and Ryszard Kaczorowski, the last President of the Polish government-in-exile.The Law and Justice Party was in power at the time, led then as now by Lech Kaczynski's identical twin brother Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Jaroslaw was himself Prime Minister of Poland from 2006 to 2007. Jaroslaw contested the vacated Presidency later that year but was defeated by Bronislaw Komorowski of the Civic Platform Party. Lech and Jaroslaw co-founded Law and Justice.Russian and Polish investigations deemed the crash an accident. Edmund Klich, head of the Polish air accident investigatory body, said in 2010 the Polish military pilots of the Tupolev Tu-154 were determined to get the dignitaries through dense fog so they could attend the ceremony. He said the pilots were insufficiently trained and put safety second, whilst Russian air traffic controllers should have diverted the aircraft away from Smolensk. Passengers entered the cockpit during the final stages of the flight. Government spokesman Elzbieta Witek yesterday said Donald Tusk, a former Prime Minister, should be prosecuted before the State Tribunal, although Witek said this was a personal view and not government policy. Jaroslaw and allies have insinuated Russia purposefully brought the plane down.Law and Justice accuse Tusk, Prime Minister from 2007 to 2014, of failings before and after the crash. He is accused of not ensuring the President was safe, of not establishing an international investigation, and of allowing Russia to maintain possession of the wreckage.Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee performed its own investigation blaming solely Poland's pilots and exonerating the controllers. Upon receiving the first draft of their report in 2010 Tusk branded the contents "unacceptable", the findings "without foundation", and the overall result a breach of the Chicago Convention, an international regulatory document on air travel.Tusk resigned last year to take the European Council Presidency until 2017. Witek said he had "given away" investigative control. Polish minister Adam Lipinski has previously called for Tusk's prosecution after his European duties conclude, saying he has "a lot to answer for" over the disaster.Polish conspiracy theorists have been spurred on by Russian refusal to accede to Polish requests to return wreckage, which the Russians claim to still be investigating.The new Prime Minister is Law and Justice's Beata Szydlo. Asked on Tuesday about one disappearing website containing investigative findings, Szydlo told press "the website has been closed and will simply remain closed."Almost one million people in Vancouver, Canada are still under a boil water advisory. Severe rainfall on the 16th of November led to a water quality warning for the Greater Vancouver area's two million residents. The restriction was partially lifted on Friday, but residents of Vancouver, Burnaby, and three North Shore municipalities are still advised to boil their drinking water due to high turbidity levels.A new storm is predicted to hit the region on Sunday, although it is not expected to be as severe. Wednesday's storm triggered landslides in three area water reservoirs, creating sediment levels up to ninety times higher than permitted under federal health standards. Grocery stores, restaurants, and other commercial outlets were also affected by the advisory. Over 210,000 homes were left without electricity as power lines were knocked out. Some residents are still without power.The advisory is the largest in Canadian history.United Kingdom —A British minister in the Department for International Development says that a second tsunami could hit South-East Asia within the next 50 years.Gareth Thomas warned world leaders at a natural disasters conference in the Japanese city of Kobe. The conference was called to discuss the feasibility of an early warning system for tsunamis to be set up in the Indian Ocean.He told a BBC radio program earlier today that such a system would cost £20 to £30 million pounds. There is a similar system in the Pacific Ocean, and Junichiro Koizumi, the Japanese Prime Minister, said that Japan would provide technical support for the system. "The system needs to be rapidly developed," he told the conference.The World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, being held only 10 years after the earthquake that destroyed the city, began with a silent tribute to those who lost their lives in the tsunami.The United Nations Emergency Co-ordinator, Jan Egeland, said, "I hope that nations will make a strong commitment to establishing a system in the Indian Ocean that will help vulnerable populations within the next ten years."He also added that the system would remove danger: disasters will still happen, but forewarned is forearmed.A Thai inferno greeted the world and the Year of the earth Ox (牛) after a pyrotechnic display started a blaze which ripped through Santika, a three-story Bangkok nightclub, in Ekkamai Soi 9 (Sukhumvit 63), Ekkamai district, Thong Lor. Police Colonel Suphin Sapphuang has confirmed that at least 59 people are dead - 53 at the fire scene and six later in various hospitals. At least 223 people were injured, including 29 foreigners; all have been taken to Bangkok hospitals, including Ramkhamhaeng, Bangkok, Kluaynam Thai 2, Vipa-Ram hospitals, for emergency treatment. Thong Lo (or Thong Lor or Thonglor, ทองหล่อ a.k.a. Sukhumvit Soi 55), is a road in Watthana district, Bangkok, Thailand.According to Gen. Jongrak Jutanont and media reports, the victims who suffered injuries include at least four Britons, including Steven Hall, a British national, two South Korean, one Singaporean, and four Japanese nationals, and citizens of France, Australia, Nepal, and the Netherlands. Media reports reveal most of the fatalities are Thais but foreign residents and international tourists are also among the fire victims of the "Bad Boy Party". Teo Sze Siong, a Singaporean has died, while one of the Japanese, Wada Keiichi, 25, has 60 percent burns and is in a coma. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) says it has confirmed "three Australians - a 29-year-old woman, her 30-year-old brother and a 49-year-old man - have been injured" in the fire. Firemen have put out the blaze after two hours, which started on the upper floor.Lt. Sutin Pongkhamphan has revealed a stampede of about 1,000 celebrants inside the pub, which has few exits, has caused most of the deaths and serious injuries. Others have also died due to burns, smoke inhalation and suffocation. "The fire spread very quickly because there was a lot of fuel in the club, like alcohol, foam and balloons," he added. Police Lieutenant Colonel Prawit Kantwol has further explained that "the fire started from the area of the stage where a band was playing. There were some pyrotechnics and it appears that they started the blaze." Senior fireman Wacharatpong Sri-Saard has provided details saying "there was only one main way to get out from the front. People who worked there were able to escape from the back because they knew the exits, but the others had no chance." The club's New Year's party poster advertising is entitled "Goodbye Santika," a dire omen and ironic promo gimmick, since the owner has planned to transfer the building to a new location because of termination of lease contract.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, on Thursday morning, has said that the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has established a coordinating assistance centre for injured victims.The Asian Tribune says 30 bodies are "very difficult to identify". It has further reported that all charred bodies have been delivered to the Chulalongkorn Hospital for forensic study and identification with the aid of the Police Hospital. "39 bodies had been identified by Thursday afternoon — 38 Thais and one Singaporean," Police Major Akaluk Siriyodsophon said.Three are dead after a tornado hit Cincinnati, a small town in Arkansas, about three miles from Oklahoma’s border. Around 6:00 local time, on Friday, the system, fed by warm winter air, caused several injuries, damaging the power grid.Josh Howerton, the county’s sheriff’s dispatcher, stated that the storm touched down near the town’s center. "Lots of injuries" were reported. A tornado warning for Cincinnati and nearby towns was issued by the Tulsa weather center nine minutes before the storm struck."Any time you have a significant change in air mass there is going to be unsettled weather marking the two different air masses," said Joe Sellers, a meteorologist from the National Weather Service in Oklahoma.New York Police Department spokesperson Paul Browne said that New York City's Triborough Bridge was shut down after a U-Haul truck with Arizona state license plates was found abandoned. The truck reportedly smelled of gasoline according to the toll booth operator. Officials reported that the police department's bomb squad investigated the vehicle. There was no report of a bomb, says Reuters.Police say witnesses reported seeing a man fleeing from the vehicle on Wednesday night.This comes just days after the bomb scare in Times Square.Part of a stone retaining wall supporting the Henry Hudson Parkway in New York City near 181st Street collapsed Thursday at 20:00 UTC.  The parkway was closed in both directions.The wall supported the outdoor backyard of the Castle Village co-op, and was nearly 100 years old.According to New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, no-one was injured, and there was no vehicular or pedestrian traffic at the time of the collapse.  Several parked cars were buried under rubble and debris, which spilled out across Riverside Drive where it merges with the northbound lanes of the parkway and onto the parkway itself.  The mayor said that cleanup of the wall will begin next week.A seven-month pregnant New York City resident was killed after being run over by a bus. 33-year-old Donnette Sanz, a traffic agent for the city police department was crossing a Bronx intersection at East 188th Street and Webster Avenue when a van pushed her into the path of an oncoming school bus that then pinned her to the road."We was riding along, coming down the hill," John Dargan, a passenger in the van, told the Daily News. "He said, 'Oh, my Lord, I don't have no brakes.' It happened so quick."Approximately 30 people helped lift the bus off of the woman. "I ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus," said Cheryl Brown, 47. "At first, we couldn't get it up, so then another 10 people ran over to help, and we got the bus up and the lady out."  After being freed from beneath the bus, Sanz was then transported to St. Barnabas Hospital where her baby was delivered by caesarean section.Sanz survived the birth, but died an hour later. The 1.5kg boy, named Sean Michael, was initially classified as being in critical condition, but later showed signs of improvement."The light turned red, and I couldn't stop. I tried to miss her," said the van's driver, 72-year-old Walter Walker, to the New York Post. Walker was arrested on charges of criminally negligent homicide and driving without a license. He pleaded not guilty. Police said the brakes on Walter's van were in such poor condition that the vehicle was unsafe. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said that Walker already had 20 suspensions on his driver's license.Mayor Michael Bloomberg offered condolences to Sanz's husband, Rafael. "It's a terrible poignancy that Donnette's son's birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died," Bloomberg said in a statement.Sanz's colleagues have set up a memorial at the intersection where she was killed.At least fourteen people have died after a chartered bus crashed in The Bronx, New York. According to authorities, the tour bus accident also injured eighteen other people, amongst which five were critically injured.The vehicle was travelling from Mohegan Sun in Connecticut to the village of Uncasville, also located in Connecticut. When the crash occurred on Interstate 95 at approximately 0535 EST (1035 UTC) on Sunday, there were at least thirty-one passengers present.40-year-old Ophadell Williams, the driver of the bus, reported to the police that the vehicle came into contact with a semi-trailer truck, which was veering across the interstate. He said that he attempted to move out of the way of this vehicle, causing the bus itself to swerve, overturn and scrape the side of a railing for one hundred yards before impacting with a highway sign's upholding bar.Captain James Ellson, of the fire service, described the scene as "a pile of humans, either still in their seats or on the floor, wrapped in the metal". Jose Hernandez, one of the survivors of the bus crash, said that "[w]e tried to help people, but there was twisted metal in the way".The semi-trailer truck driver failed to stop after the accident. Police are currently attempting to detect this driver. Raymond Kelly, the current New York City Police Commissioner, stated that the truck was moving on a lane to the bus' nearside, although whether the vehicles came into contact with each other or not is yet to be confirmed. Both vehicles were travelling at "a significant rate of speed", according to Kelly.According to the New York Police Department (NYPD), New York City's Staten Island Ferry has crashed into a passenger terminal, causing over 60 injuries. The New York Fire Department (NYFD) reports to the press that they are on the scene and are giving emergency treatment.No life-threatening injuries have been reported, although a few of the passengers were transported by the NYFD to local city hospitals. The accident is still under investigation by the NYPD. In all, 252 passengers were aboard the ship, along with eighteen various crew members.According to some of the passengers that were on the ship, the boat sped up right before hitting the dock, when it should have actually been slowing down so that it could let passengers on from the station. An early report of the investigation is that the captain of the ship mistakenly lost engine control.The Staten Island Ferry is a major form of transportation between the two New York city boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island. Five different ships carry approximately 60,000 passengers each day across the New York Harbor.The ship, the Andrew J. Barberi, was also involved in another crash in 2003, where it crashed into the same dock and killed eleven people.Private Meredith Simms, 18-years-old, died yesterday when the New Zealand Army Mercedes-Benz Unimog truck he was travelling in left the road and fell 100-metres down a steep bank 2.30 p.m. yesterday (NZST), coming to rest on railway tracks. The soldier driving the truck was critically injured and was flown by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter to Wellington Hospital, where he is being treated for spinal cord injuries.The Unimog was travelling in a convoy 14-kilometres southeast of Blenheim on State Highway 1, Weld Pass.The New Zealand police have launched an inquiry into the fatal accident. The Unimog has been removed from the scene of the crash and will now be examined. The police say that they will guard the scene and finish examining it today.The accident occurred when the Unimog was returning back to the Burnham Military Camp, Christchurch, where all soldiers were from. It followed a ten day exercise which involved 15 vehicles in Marlborough. The other soldiers went to the RNZAF Base Woodbourne base to receive counselling from a military chaplain, military psychologist and police victim support, they are returning to Burnham today.The family of the deceased said their son "died doing what he loved," and have requested privacy.Simms' death has been referred to a coroner.Since 1994 there have been eight fatal accidents involving Unimogs.The New Zealand Christmas road toll  has climbed to only one fewer; than the 11 deaths in the entire period last year; after four people were killed today. The official Christmas-New Year road toll runs between 4pm on 24th December and 8am on 4th January“There are 10 families now having to plan funerals and that's enormously tragic for all of those involved”. Says National Road Manager; Superintendent Dave Cliff. He says that he is “disappointed with the high toll this far.”Road victims this Christmas 2005 include:Today:A 19 year old died when a car and a van collided at the intersection of SH60 and Harleys Rd, near Motueka.One person killed on SH4, southwest of Te Kuiti.after car hits  a tree.A 10-year-old boy killed yesterday, on SH30, after a 4WD rolls.One person killed at the Kopu intersection. After a car and campervan collide.Earlier in the week:On Boxing Day, a motorcyclist was killed on SH1 between Orewa and Waiwera.On Christmas Day in Wanganui, a 15-year-old was killed.Also on Christmas day; a 30-year-old man died in a crash on SH35, near Te KahaOn Christmas Eve, two people died in a head-on crash on SH1 south of Kawakawa.And on Friday, a driver was killed at a rail crossing near Sefton.The New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) made an emergency evacuation of staff from Raoul Island, the largest and northernmost of the Kermadec Islands, due to a volcanic eruption that occurred this morning at 8:21am (New Zealand Daylight Time).A helicopter picked up the five available staff, but one missing staff member could not be found before it had to leave. The return journey is 2000km (1300 miles).The missing man, aged in his 30s, failed to return "after going on a routine mission to check the water temperature of the lake," according to Rolien Elliot, DOC Area Manager for Warkworth.She said that when two of the others went to look for their colleague where he was thought to be, they “had to retreat due to further volcanic activity and the track being impassable with fallen trees and ash.”The blast had significantly changed the island's landscape. "There's been about five hectares of native bush cleared and a lot of mud and evidence of boulders and rocks that have been thrown out of the crater itself," the helicopter pilot John Funnell said to One News.The New Zealand Christmas holiday road toll has been the lowest it has ever been with nine deaths in 26-years, 1981.The annual road toll is also the lowest it has ever been since 1963, with 387 deaths for the whole of 2006.The Christmas holiday period starts at 4:00 p.m. (UTC+13) on Christmas Eve and runs until 6:00 a.m. January 3, 2007.John McLelland, national road policing inspector, said: "I'd like to think that people are taking more care when travelling and hopefully with the advertising...people are more aware of the consequences of poor decision making if they are involved in a crash." Mr McLelland is starting to think that drivers are concentrating more but still believes that drivers are speeding, not wearing compulsory seat-belts and drinking and driving. He is also urging drivers to take care of both themselves and the other road users. "...we need to think about our driving and how we go about it on the road."Mr McLelland, said: "Drivers aged 25 to 60 made up the majority of road crash fatalities. And that's also probably got something to do with the aging population as well."Even though the holiday period is over, Mr McLelland is still asking drivers to be cautious as many people will be returning home from their holidays.In 2006 the holiday road toll was 22, and in 2005 the toll was at 11.The New Zealand Christmas – New Year road toll has climbed to 9 more than the 11 deaths in the entire period last year, after a Korean man became the 20th victim when his car ended up in a canal.The official Christmas-New Year road toll runs between 4pm on 24th December and 6am on 4th January.The final tally still needs to be officially confirmed by the police; this should happen in the next 1 to 2 months. Police National Road Safety Manager, Inspector John Kelly, says “the final toll may fluctuate, depending on the outcome of investigations into the crashes that took place."The fatalities are: eight passengers, seven drivers, three motorcyclists and two pedestrians. "The toll is one of the highest” says Andy Knackstedt, from LTNZ, “it's certainly nearly double the number that died on the roads [in the holiday period] last year”. In 2005, for the full year, 404 people died on New Zealand roads, which is 31 less than the previous year.A New Zealand Marilyn Manson gig was evacuated after a fire scare. Four songs into the performance by the shock rock act at Auckland Town Hall, a fire scare caused an evacuation of the venue. On-site security stopped the performer from continuing and asked the audience to leave immediately.Fire and ambulance crews responded, but discovered that the alarms had been caused by dry ice smoke machines.Manson was able to continue his performance after a delay of ten minutes.A New Zealand police car landed on its roof after colliding with a truck in Upper Hutt at 9am NZDT (2100 UTC) today, closing State Highway 2.The highway patrol car flipped, and its siren-lights ripped off, during a collision with two other cars at an intersection of River Road and Gibbons Street. The police officer had minor injuries, but needed surgery to his hand and the truck driver was not hurt, a police communications spokesman said. The Serious Crash Unit is currently investigating.Senior Sergeant Benge says police are speaking with witnesses, but will not have a clear idea about what happened until they can speak with the people involved in the crash. He says that could be a few days away.Benge says initial investigations indicate the police car was not involved in a pursuit, however witnesses say the car appeared to be rushing to a job with lights flashing. The truck was carrying a load of windows and shattered glass was scattered over the intersection.An Albany, North Shore, Auckland, New Zealand Post shop and the surrounding roads were closed today due to an Internet magazine giving away free promotional "fart bombs" which went off during postal sorting.After the "fart bomb" exploded due to other mail items being placed on top of the magazines, worried postal workers called the firefighters' hazardous substance unit to the post office. The arrival of the firefighters resulted in the post shop and the surrounding roads closure at around 8.00 a.m. (NZDT). Mike McEnaney, acting deputy chief fire officer of the North Shore, said that the postal workers had no choice but to call the fire brigade when they noticed the smell. "Until you can identify what the substance is you have got the potential there for a hazardous chemical incident."Douglas Lyell, fire service officer, said that the postal workers described the smell as sulphur like. Mr. McEnaney said that after the smell was identified, both firefighters and the postal workers kept a good distance. "It was definitely a smell of sulphur."Mr. Lyell said that when the firefighters and the hazardous substance unit were able to trace the smell back to the burst "fart bomb" the post shop and surrounding roads were reopened.Mr. Lyell now asks the magazine to consider changing their packaging.A New Zealand woman who lay down between railway tracks  and had a freight train run over her is "incredibly lucky", sustaining only  minor injuries, according to Sue Foley, spokeswoman for the railway company, Toll Holdings.The driver saw the woman lying in between the tracks while the train was travelling at about 20 km/h. Despite the slow speed of the train, the driver was unable to stop the train before it ran over the woman. "By the time he stopped the train and walked back down the line, she popped out from under the third wagon," said Mike Lawton, acting sergeant for Feilding police.The woman was flown to Palmerston North Hospital after complaining about sore elbows and shoulders and receiving minor injuries.The driver of the train has been offered counselling while he has been taken off driving duties.Police and the train operator would not comment on why the woman was lying between the tracks.New Zealand's warm sunny New Year's weather has come to a sudden end as gale force winds and rain assault southern New Zealand.In parts of the South Island New Year campers have finished their holiday early as winds averaging 120km/h (75 m/h), gusting at times up to 180km/h (112 m/h), have blown in.Power went out to 1300 homes in the capital city Wellington; flights were grounded at the airport, with incoming flights diverted to Palmerston North airport. “The North Island will also be affected by the low,” says  MetService forecaster Michael Short, “with heavy rain around the Tararua Ranges and Mt Taranaki.”The MetService has issued severe weather warnings for most of the South Island and the southern portion of the North Island; bad weather is also forecasted throughout the rest of the country.  The MetService says to expect bad weather for the next 10 days as a deepening low moves south of Stewart Island, but a flow of westerly winds is expected to stay put all week.Holiday makers have been asked by MetService to review their holiday plans and keep up to date with the latest weather.A script prepared by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Government of the United Kingdom in the 1970s, and released today, shows the text of the radio announcement that would be made in case of a nuclear attack on Britain. The script was released by The National Archives, and it was discussed during the years from 1973 to 1975, as an act of preparation for a nuclear attack. This increased concern occurred due to the ongoing Cold War. The script started by saying "This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes." It emphasised people should not leave their homes: "Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger.""If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors."The script continued by telling citizens to "make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished," before telling the listener to "use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes." "Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for 14 days or more," continued the script. "If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out."The script finishes people by telling people to turn off their radio to conserve energy.The documents were released under Britain's Freedom of Information Act, and it also said that all reports should be given out in an authoritative and comforting tone. It also contains letters from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications which describe how the use of a familiar voice will assure listeners that the BBC has not been obliterated.Months after the end of the aerial search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which went missing with 239 people aboard over the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam on March 8, underwater search efforts began a second phase on Monday.Initial maps of the sea floor were not clear enough to assist in the search. Since suspension of the initial search, the Australian government has been constructing a clearer sea-floor map, essential for the search and to ensure no underwater collision with remains of the aircraft. Back in May, a signal consistent with that of a radio beacon was detected in the area, but nothing turned up that helped with the search.In this phase, the Australian government has started using a special vessel, the GO Phoenix, for undersea debris search.The GO Phoenix has special technology using sonar to search underwater for possible debris of the flight. The special equipment is able to search far enough above the ocean floor that it shouldn't hit any debris, according to Martin Dolan of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which is coordinating the search. Each segment of the search could last for several weeks before resupply in Western Australia.Additional ships, from Dutch company Fugro Survey, are to join the search in upcoming weeks.This isn't the only incident with a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, another 777, was shot down near the Ukraine–Russia border on July 17.Nick Hogan, 17, the son of wrestling star Hulk Hogan has been "seriously injured" in a vehicle accident along with one other unnamed individual. Both are reported to have been flown via helicopter to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Florida.TMZ.com reports that police and witnesses say the accident occurred in Clearwater, Florida around 7:30 p.m. (eastern time) on Sunday night while Hogan was driving his Toyota Supra at a "very high rate of speed." He lost control of his car and hit the center median, flipping which then slammed into a palm tree, resting on its back end.The police said the two travelling in the car sustained "very very serious" injuries. They also said that the tree "destroyed the entire car".A police officer was not far behind the car when it flipped over and radioed in for help. Firefighters had to use the 'jaws of life' to cut Hogan and the other individual free from the wreckage.No call was made to 911 and the occupants conditions are not yet known.Actress Nicole Kidman was injured in a car accident while filming the movie, The Invasion. The car reportedly went off course, and ran into a light pole on West Sixth Street in Los Angeles, California."The stunt driver apparently went off course and hit a light post," said Karen Smith, a officer with the Los Angeles Police Department."Nicole Kidman was in the vehicle at the time of the accident and was taken to the hospital for evaluation. She was released shortly thereafter," said a statement issued by Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.Kidman, along with eight other people were taken to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles where all were released with minimal injuries just 2 hours later. All are reported to have returned to work. Paramedics also treated Kidman on scene before she was taken to the hospital."I think she's OK," said Catherine Olim, Kidman's publicist.Kidman was inside a Jaguar.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has warned that 2.5 million people living in the African country of Niger are facing food shortages. Of those, about 800,000 are children.Supplies of the staple foods - such as millet - have been low, forcing prices up. Drought and plagues of locust devastated crops across the Sahel region of Africa, and in Niger the effects have been compounded by years of economic decline.More than a third of the countries districts face "critical" or "extremely critical" situations. While rainfall in the last few weeks has improved, seeds are in short supply after the earlier droughts.The FAO launched an appeal to the world community for $4m of aid to combat the situation. So far, the only contributor has been Sweden, who donated $650,000 of seeds and animal fodder, which is currently being distributed to make the most of the current rains.It is said by Oxfam that the neighbouring countries of Mali and Mauritania are also affected putting the total number of people at risk close to 5 million.At least one person has been killed and at least thirty were injured as the result of a fire in the city of Lagos in Nigeria after an explosion in a building with fireworks stored in it. As many as nine other buildings in the Lagos Island fire yesterday were also impacted by the flames, according to authorities. The fire was reportedly the cause of the explosion, although this is yet to be confirmed.Some local residents reportedly jumped out of the windows of buildings in fright in the large commercial area of Jankara. One man, Wasiu Olaleye, required treatment for a cut to his leg because "I had to jump from the first floor to save my life", he said. Some local businesses were open when the incident occurred, but yesterday was a public holiday in Nigeria.A school located in close proximity to the warehouse was significantly damaged in the incident. Numerous vehicles in the area were completely burnt out by the fire. The windows of several nearby buildings were also destroyed as the fire caused the windows of houses a few miles away to shake. Thick smoke was also sighted above Lagos.Crowds of thousands of nearby people accumulated near the fire, with spectators and individuals intending to assist or gain information about relatives amongst them. Three fire service tanker vehicles attended the scene, but used up all their water supplies. Some people in the crowd attempted to assist fire crews with holding fire hoses and gathering water-filled containers. Some of these people were taken to hospital for treatment after experiencing injuries. One official reported military assistance was used. Additional water arrived later, as the severity of the fire slowly decreased.The large crowds were part of the reason it took around an hour for fire service members to reach the scene of the fire. News agency Reuters was told by a government official that the possibility of further explosions from fireworks also interfered with the fire service's rescue operation. "It's very dangerous for the firemen to go in, because the government don't want any of these men to be injured", they said.Ibrahim Farinloye from the National Emergency Management Agency reported one fatality to Agence France-Presse (AFP), saying: "We pulled out a body from the building". Nicolas Adesile, of the Red Cross, told the same news agency that as many as thirty people have been treated thus far.A fuel tanker explosion in Nigeria has left at least 30 dead. The disaster occurred near a busy bus station in Port Harcourt.Port Harcourt is located in an oil rich area, and is the central point of the Nigerian oil industry, which has a value of billions of US Dollars. It is consequently a regular target for extremists, but a police spokesman said terrorism is not believed to be a factor.According to CNN, the same spokesman said a car's driver lost control whilst being chased by police, striking the tanker and triggering the explosion. However, AFP reports that the tanker itself was being chased for carrying stolen petrol, and said the vehicle overturned after hitting a barricade on a partially constructed section of road in a bid to escape. The Associated Press (AP) makes no mention of a police chase, and says the lorry overturned after suffering a blowout.The crash occurred at a major junction in Eleme district. Fuel was spilled over cars and shop entrances before igniting. Local shop owner Matthew Eliagwu described the disaster to AP: "I heard a loud bang and I came out of my shop. I saw fire running down towards my shop, but I escaped. It was impossible to help anyone, because I had to run for my life."At least 15 vehicles are known to have been destroyed, ten of which were buses, as well as 20 shops. Most victims are believed to be street vendors in the vicinity of the tanker at the time. It took hours for firefighters to bring the flames under control. At present no figures are available for numbers of injuries, but at least 30 are dead.AFP reports that although no arrests have yet been confirmed, local residents placed the tanker's driver amongst the survivors and said he was receiving treatment in a local hospital.Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest exporter of crude oil, although violence has caused this to be reduced by over a quarter. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has claimed responsibility for a series of recent attacks, including one aimed at four ships in the Bonny Channel - the nation's largest oil and gas terminal - and an explosion and fire yesterday on a seagoing oil tanker berthed in Port Harcourt's sea terminal.Fuel tanker and pipeline explosions are common in Nigeria, often triggered by looters. Just eleven days ago, on January 1, another fuel tanker rolled over and caught fire in Port Harcourt, destroying dozens of shops and houses, although there were no fatalities. In March 2007 an overturned tanker in Kaduna State exploded whilst being targeted by looters, killing 93.Accidents are common as the country's roads are inadequately maintained, as are many of the vehicles that use them. Death tolls are often high because vendors crowd many major roadways.A Nigerian Air Force jet fighter mistook refugees for rebels yesterday, Nigerian military said, firing on a camp in Rann, Borno State. Dozens of refugees and aid workers died.The lowest estimate from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is of 50 dead. The BBC estimates at least 52 dead, while one Borno State official is attributed by AP as saying over 100 are dead. MSF say at least 200 were wounded.The Red Cross said at least six of its staff died and twelve more injured. The impoverished region, in the northeast of the nation, has suffered severe famine as conflict interrupts agriculture. Farmers are unable to work owing to bombs on their land. The Red Cross said volunteers were at the camp, home to thousands, to distribute food.The military said the Air Force was dispatched to deal with "remnants" of the Boko Haram militant group, which it claims to be in a final push against. Major General Leo Irabor, who led the operation, said, "Unfortunately, the strike was conducted but it turned out that other civilians were somewhere around the area and they were affected". Irabor said two soldiers were amongst the dead and others were wounded.Military spokesman General Rabe Abubakar said the military are "all in pain" after the disaster, adding "in a military operation such as this, from time to time these things do occur." Irabor promised an investigation. President Muhammadu Buhari said he was saddened by "this regrettable operational mistake" and sought calm."This large-scale attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable," MSF operational chief Dr Jean-Clément Cabrol said. The Red Cross said it has staff and facilities ready in neighbouring Cameroon and Chad to assist. "The whole camp is controlled by the army and no one can come in or out without being checked," said MSF head of emergencies Hugues Robert. Robert added the group knew travel and work in the area was dangerous, and took precautions. Helicopters have been evacuating the wounded, including a United Nations helicopter which brought four medical personnel and 400kg (900lb) of emergency medical aid, and left with eight wounded Red Cross workers. The UN is in the midst of an appeal for aid to the famine-hit region.U.S. authorities have charged Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab with trying to blow up a plane on its descent into the city of Detroit, Michigan on Friday. The man, who comes from a prominent Nigerian family, was read the charges in a hospital Saturday, where he is being treated for burns.  The charges were read by United States District Judge Paul Borman while Abdulmutallab was being held at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.Abdulmutallab was asked if he understood the charges against him, and he answered in English that he did. Witnesses reported he was in a wheelchair with a blanket over his lap.  The U.S. government accuses the Nigerian national of bringing an explosive device onto Friday's Northwest Airlines Flight 253 plane from Amsterdam in the Netherlands. A preliminary analysis by federal authorities indicates he used a syringe to detonate a highly explosive substance, identified as PETN. Abdulmutallab said he got the explosives in Yemen from an Al Qaeda bomb maker who sewed the device into his underwear.Passengers have told investigators the man went into the bathroom for 20 minutes before landing and complained about stomach problems before pulling a blanket on himself.Just as the plane was getting ready to land, they heard a pop, smelled smoke and then saw the man on fire. A Dutch passenger, Jasper Schuringa, jumped on the Nigerian to subdue him, and a fire extinguisher was used to put out the fire.  The House Committee on Homeland Security chairman, Bennie Thompson, said it was a very close call. "We're just fortunate nothing happened. This was a serious situation," he said. Thompson said Congress will look into the matter soon. "As soon as we reconvene from the holiday recess, we will start looking into the circumstances around the Northwest flight incident."Nigeria's acting ambassador to the United States, Babagana Wakil, immediately issued a statement, which he read to the Voice of America over the phone. "Expectedly, the embassy is already in contact with relevant U.S. authorities over the incident to facilitate any preliminary investigations to get to the bottom of this unfortunate development. Officers from the embassy have already flown to Michigan to gain consular access to the individual under investigation, and to offer the mission's cooperation to federal and local authorities," he said.The suspect's family members in Nigeria said they were shocked. The suspect's father, an accountant and businessman, was previously a very well known banker in Africa's most populous nation. Friends and family said Adbulmutallab had studied in Togo and London, and that he had recently made several trips to Yemen. His father had, apparently, made concerns with his son's extremist connections known to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.Adbulmutallab told the FBI he met with a radical Yemeni cleric he corresponded with online. The cleric is not believed to be Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Imam connected to Major Nidal Malik Hasan who carried out the Fort Hood shooting last month.Friday, the White House said it believed it was an attempted act of terrorism. U.S. media reports say the suspect told interrogators he had affiliations with Al Qaeda.The charges that were read against him Saturday carry a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.Meanwhile, security screening measures have upgraded in the wake of the foiled attack, including only allowing one carry-on bag for international passengers, banning anyone from moving around the airplane during the last hour of the flight and additional "unpredictable" measures that will vary from airport to airport.A warehouse fire on Brooklyn's waterfront has become a nine alarm blaze. The complex of seven old warehouses has been virtually destroyed and authorities are currently investigating it as arson.Some 400 firefighters have working to extinguish the fire which started a little after 5:30 in the morning. A technique referred to as "surround and drown" has been employed in which fire trucks have flanked the complex on three sides while boats pump water from the adjacent river onto the blaze.According to the New York Fire Department, some six million gallons of water have been pumped onto the site and the ninth alarm, which was posted around noon, makes it the second biggest fire in the city's history.By noon, many of the buildings had been almost entirely destroyed. Area residents say that the complex was due to be demolished anyway to make a new park.Nine people died in New Zealand after a small tourist plane crashed on Saturday afternoon on the West Coast of the South Island, killing all on board.  The aircraft, a Fletcher FU24 owned by a local sky diving company, crashed and caught fire at 13:15 local time soon after taking off from the Fox Glacier Airport to carry out tandem skydiving over the Fox Glacier.  The cause of the accident is not yet known, but the plane banked, dipped, smashed nose-first into the ground, and burst into flames. There were four overseas tourists on the plane, from Australia, England, Germany, and Ireland.  The five New Zealanders were the pilot and four divemasters.  Police spokeswoman Detective Sergeant Jackie Adams said that the victims were so badly burned that members of the police disaster team had to be called in to assist.  She was trying to track a group of tourists who were to have gone on the flight, but wanted to go together as a group so let those who died go ahead of them. The plane crash was the worst in New Zealand for nearly 17 years. The regional coroner Richard McElrea was travelling to the crash scene to begin inquiries, and the Transport Accident Investigation Commission has dispatched a team of six investigators. The probes may take a year to complete. There was a similar crash near Fox Glacier when a helicopter crashed killing seven people in October 1994, and a crash near the nearby Franz Josef Glacier in October 1993 which killed 9 people. Because of the earthquake in Christchurch the bodies had to be sent to the Auckland morgue rather than the nearer Christchurch morgue.A wooden suspension bridge in Peru, measuring 130 feet (39.6 m), broke into two pieces killing nine people and seriously injuring 70 others, mostly children. Two of the dead were teachers, and seven were students aged 10 to 13.At least 70 to 80 people were on the bridge at the time of the collapse which happened near Coracora, the capital city of Parinacochas Province.As four local schools were dismissed, the teachers and students walked home, crossing the bridge.  Investigators say the bridges' collapse was due to too many people crossing at a single time.The bridge traversed a dry riverbed canyon 320 feet (97.5 m) deep which had housed the Santa Barbara River. The suspension bridge is reported to be made of wooden board slats which were supported by steel cables anchored to cement posts."We've suffered a grave accident, a suspension bridge that goes to a high school has fallen, it has broken in two and we have a large number of students injured and dead." said Walter Antayhua, Mayor of Coracora. The bridge was slated for repairs last week.Helicopters were dispatched to take the injured to the hospital, however rescue efforts were hampered by fog which prevented some of them from landing. 70 of the injured victims in a local hospital are suffering from serious injuries. Ayacucho health director Maria Torrealba reported that 33 of those were head injuries.Rescuers continue their efforts to save 30 more school children, said Ayacucho Governor Ernesto Molina.Nine people have been killed when a cargo plane failed to take off correctly at Culiacán Airport in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico yesterday.The plane, owned by a mail courier company, is thought to have blown a tire during the take-off procedure, causing it to run off the end of the runway and break through a wall. It then crashed onto an adjacent highway, killing three crew members aboard the aircraft and six people on the road.The six included two members of a security presence for Mexican President Felipe Calderón, who was due to arrive shortly after the incident for a day visit. A family of four were also killed when their car was engulfed by flames that were trailing the aircraft.The President, who was in a plane en route to Culiacán at the time of the incident, cancelled his visit after hearing the news.The accident comes during the rescue attempts following landslides in the central state of Puebla. Up to 60 people were killed in the slide the day prior to the Culiacán incident, according to local authorities.According to Agence France-Presse, ten people have been killed and 160 wounded in an explosion at a mosque in southern Iran. The bomb exploded in the city of Shiraz, which, in addition to being the capital of the Fars Province, is the fifth most populous city in Iran.Saideh Ghorbani, who witnessed the bombing, said that at "around 9:15 pm, after the sermon, the sound of an explosion resounded in the section reserved for men and a cloud of dust billowed up to the sky."The perpetrators of the bombing are not yet known.An avalanche in the French Alps has caused at least nine fatalities, French authorities have confirmed. At least another nine were also injured in the incident in the Mont Maudit, close to the commune of Chamonix in the south-east of the country.Emergency services were alerted to the incident area when one of the individuals directly affected by the avalanche activated the emergency alarm at approximately 0525 CEST (0325 UTC) this morning. Local authorities have described the avalanche, which impacted roped groups, as "the most deadly of recent years".Four people are reportedly still missing. Heat-seeking devices and helicopters are being used by rescue workers to search for missing persons.Around 28 individuals of various nationalities were thought to be participating in the expedition. Injured victims have been transported to hospital by airlift.Mont Maudit, the third greatest peak in the Mont Blanc massif, has a height of 4,465 metres (about 14,650 feet). Its name translates into English as 'cursed mountain'.Nine firefighters were killed on Monday while battling a massive fire at a furniture warehouse in Charleston, South Carolina. Firefighters were called to the scene of a massive blaze at the Sofa Super Store in Charleston, S.C. at around 6:30 p.m. EST. At around 7 p.m., nine firefighters were sent inside the inferno to rescue people who were trapped inside the building. They rescued two before the ceiling collapsed on top of them. All nine firefighters who were inside the warehouse died. They are:Capt. William Hutchinson, 48Capt. Mike Benke, 49Capt. Louis Mulkey, 34FF Mark Kelsey, 40FF Bradford Baity, 37FF Michael French, 27FF James "Earl" Drayton, 56FF Brandon Thompson, 27FF Melven Champaign, 46The disaster recalls Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire that killed six firefighters on Dec. 3, 1999, in Worcester, Massachusetts. The chief of the Worcester Fire Department flew down to South Carolina for the memorial service.According to a report from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 500,000 Somalians are directly affected by a drought, around 400,000 are internally displaced, and an additional 12,000 Somalians had been affected by seasonal flooding in the central regions of Hiraan and Middle Shabelle as well as in the self-declared northwestern republic of Somaliland."Overall, the extended effects of four years of drought, which adversely impacted livelihoods and coping mechanisms, combined with chronic food insecurity, and more recently flooding has exacerbated the suffering of Somalis," said the report.OCHA estimates that around 44,000 people were directly affected by the tsunami, and many still need urgent humanitarian assistance, the agency said.  An estimated figure released by OCHA stated that $162,266,738 would be needed to be raised to target an estimated 900,000 vulnerable people. As of June 10, donors had funded approximately 39 percent of this appeal.The December Indian Ocean Tsunami devastated the northeastern Somali coastline, further worsening the humanitarian situation now seen in Somalia. Good seasonal rains in Somalia which have ended a four-year drought have done little to help the estimated 900,000 Somalians in need of humanitarian aid.All seven on board a Russian Antonov An-12 have been killed after the plane crashed near the Siberian city of Chelyabinsk. The Moskovia Airlines plane had left the city's airport empty and was destined for Perm in the Ural Mountains.An emergency ministry spokeswoman, Natalya Andryanova, said on state TV "The pilot told ground control that there was smoke in the cockpit and he decided to return to the airport. The plane crashed as he was coming in for landing." The plane is reported to have gone down in forest about a dozen miles from the city at about 6 p.m. According to regional emergency official Vyacheslav Latunkin, the plane hit a power line.The An-12 is a large, four-engined cargo turboprop that can carry 20 tons and was designed in the 1950s. Large numbers were sold for use in both the military and civilian markets, and around 100 are still in service. Dmitry Medvedev  expressed his condolences and ordered Transport Minister Igor Levitin to launch an inquiry. Interfax reports that a criminal investigation has also been launched into possible regulatory breaches.Local resident Vladimir Zonov said wreckage was spread across 300 metres. He also said the plane crashed into a wheat field and not forest as otherwise reported.Russian air safety is among the worst in the world, as is that of many former Soviet countries. Industry analysts blame poor pilot training, cost-reduction at the cost of safety and inadequate control by the government.Nine people were killed and 31 were injured after a car bomb blew up in the city of Falluja in western Iraq, local officials said. At least five of the victims were police officers.This is the second bomb blast in the Anbar province within the past few days. Six people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated explosives at a funeral in Haditha on Monday."Security forces are still looking for victims under the rubble," said the head of the Amiriya local municipal council, Shaker al-Issawi.According to reports from witnesses, the blast was so strong that it threw bodies onto rooftops of neighbouring buildings.Unlike previous such explosions, this explosion did not appear to be set by a suicide bomber. A witness near where the car bomb exploded said that a man had parked a blue truck, and left it a quarter of an hour before it exploded.Nine people are confirmed dead in a fire in a leather bag factory in Kolkata's South 24 Pargana district in Topsia area.Eighteen people were seriously injured and admitted to the National Medical College and Hospital.Inspector General of Police (Law and Order) Raj Kanojia said that the fire broke out at about 3 a.m. local time, when the victims were inside the factory and all the doors were closed.Director General of Fire Brigade Gopal Bhattacharjee said that it was an illegal factory in Kolkata located at third floor of the building. At the time of fire, all the exits were shut and workers could not come out from the factory.The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. Kolkata Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya suggested that a short circuit or an unattended cigarette may have caused the fire.Five firetenders were rushed to the spot. Firefighters fought the blaze for hours and rescued the people who were residing in the building at the time of fire.A search and rescue mission is underway off the coast of California for nine people missing after a US Coast Guard plane collided in midair with a Navy helicopter. The plane, a C-130 Hercules transport, was carrying seven and two were on the AH-1 SuperCobra assault helicopter.Searchers from the Navy and Coast Guard have found floating debris from the aircraft. The collision occurred roughly 15 miles from San Clemente Island, and a pilot in the area witnessed a fireball. Some debris is confirmed as coming from a C-130. The plane and crew were based at Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento and the helicopter and crew were from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing presence at Camp Pendleton.According to Petty Officer Henry Dunphy, the airplane was equipped with survival gear.  "We're hoping to find survivors. We're not ruling that out," he said.The rescue operation is being conducted by both air and sea. Lieutenant Josh Nelson of the Coast Guard said that "we are throwing everything we can at this right now," adding that the crews were trained in survival techniques.Nine oil workers have been killed after their helicopter crashed in Siberia, Russia."According to provisional information, there were 16 people on board, including three crew members. At least nine people died," a spokesman for Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry told reporters. The crash occurred in Yamalo-Nenets, an oil-rich region in Northern Siberia.A Federal Air Transport Agency told Interfax that only thirteen were onboard the aircraft, which was operated by UT Air, but agreed with the death toll of nine. He also said that three people received minor injuries and a fourth was seriously injured. All the passengers worked on a local drilling platform.The aircraft was headed from Noyabrsk to the Varginskoye oilfield. It caught fire after crashing. According to the ministry, the crash site was "70 kilometers from the border between the Khanty Mansi Autonomous Area and Yamal".Two more Mi-8s were flown in with emergency workers.At least nine people have died after a ferry with over 960 passengers on board sank off the southeast coast of the Philippines on Sunday. Thirty more are still unaccounted for.According to coast guards, 931 people were rescued from the SuperFerry 9, which had departed from General Santos City and was headed for the peninsula of Zamboanga. The vessel began to list at 02.30 local time  (18.30 UTC), and issued a distress call an hour later. The captain reportedly tried to correct the list, but ordered the ship's rafts to be released when it became clear it was impossible to get the vessel straightened back out again.The cause of the incident is not yet certain.  Maritime accidents occur frequently in the Philippines, mainly due to poor maintenance of ships, relaxed safety enforcement, overcrowding of ships, and inclement weather.Last year, 802 passengers including crew were killed when the MV Princess of the Stars ferry sank during a typhoon.Nine Peruvian miners were extracted from a collapsed copper mine Wednesday morning after spending six days underground. They were trapped under the Cabeza de Negro mine in Ica, Peru since the cave-in last Thursday.The rescue operation over the weekend was delayed by another cave-in. Workers used shovels, pickaxes, and wheelbarrows to remove more than 26 feet of earth. The only source of communication and provisions including food, water, and oxygen was a tube set in place before the shaft collapsed. Inside the mine, the men told jokes to maintain their spirits. "It's pretty ugly inside," said Edwin Bellido, one of the freed miners. "We slept on the ground on muddy plastic."President Ollanta Humala welcomed the miners as they ascended from the mine. The event rekindled Humala’s efforts to convert Peru's illegal mines into government-recognized entities that could be regulated for safety. "This should lead us to reflect that we have to avoid these kind of risks because the results will not always be like today," said Humala.The nine men trapped in the southern mine will be alright after they get over dehydration and dizziness, the president said. Mining accidents killed more than 50 individuals last year in Peru's illegal mines.On Tuesday, a Sikorsky S-61  helicopter crashed northwest of Redding, California. The helicopter had been carrying 11 firemen who had been battling a wildfire just north of Junction City, and two crewmen. Eight of the firefighters and one of the crewmen are missing and presumed dead.  Four out of the 13 members of the flight were rescued from the crash, though they received severe burns. Sharon Heywood, a United States Forest Service spokesperson said that the three firefighters and pilot had been initially airlifted to Mercy Medical Center in Redding. However, because of the critical condition of two of the firemen and the pilot, the three of them were transferred to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The remaining firefighter remains at Mercy Medical Center in serious condition.The helicopter, which is owned by Carson Helicopters, crashed "under unknown circumstances," according to Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The helicopter crashed 35 miles northwest of Redding in the Trinity Alp region, at roughly 7:30 p.m. Tuesday evening, said Gregor. Both the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board investigators were on the scene of the crash.The firefighters had been fighting flames covering more than 27 square miles in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. They had been working near the north end of the fire, which is reportedly 87% contained.Nine people were rescued by helicopter from the roof of a blazing skyscraper in Taiwan on Saturday.The people were dining in the rooftop restaurant when a fire broke out lower in the 25 story Golden Plaza Tower. The fire is said to have started in a disco on the 18th floor at about 4pm local time.Four people died in the fire, including two employees of the tower. The body of a security officer was found on the 18th floor with another body found nearby. Two more were found in an elevator. Two or three people suffered minor injuries after inhaling smoke.The building in Taichung, Taiwan's third largest city, houses offices, shops and schools.Those fleeing the building at ground level had to cover their heads to protect themselves from falling glass and other debris. Fire fighters extinguished the blaze after an hour and a half.Nineteen people were killed and three are unaccounted for after an overloaded ferry boat sank in a river in a flooded region of Burma. Many young children, travelling to an inter-village football tournament in Michaungai, were killed when the boat sank. During the rescue efforts, bodies of children aged between five and fifteen were recovered from the water, along with the bodies of two teachers and two local villagers. Authorities are continuing to search for three people who are still missing after the disaster.There were 79 people aboard the boat when it sank in the Irrawaddy river, according to an unnamed official. A rescue worker suggested that there had been heavy rain around 10 a.m., when the ferry struck a strong wave and sank. “The boat flipped at a confluence of creeks—these are small, narrow creeks connecting villages," he said. Locals suggested that the boat, which was reportedly overloaded, flipped and lost balance, trapping young children underneath.The accident took place as strong winds and heavy rain battered the area, causing large waves and strong currents in waterways. Reports indicate that many residents of the vast region rely heavily on poorly-maintained river ferries for cheap transportation, since many areas are inaccessible by road. 138,000 people were killed and thousands more were left homeless when when Cyclone Nargis devastated the region in May 2008.A Kam Air plane from Afghanistan, traveling in China's Xinjiang region was not hijacked and did not receive a bomb threat, according to Afghan officials. Earlier the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported a plane to be hijacked. Later reports then stated the plane received a bomb threat and was diverted back to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar. The early reports say the plane was diverted back to Afghanistan after being denied an emergency landing in Ürümqi.The plane was traveling to China and had been ordered to turn around after the proper paperwork was not in place. Subsequently it was denied a landing in Ürümqi. Upon its return, the plane landed in Kabul after it encountered high winds. It is not known how many people were on board the plane, but no injuries are reported.A NATO official denied there was an emergency landing  due to a threat and says the Chinese media reports are untrue."We are aware of the reports. We have no evidence that this is true. We would know immediately," said the unnamed official.The Xinjiang region was the scene of a violent uprising by its Uyghur population last month.File:Aeroflot-Nord VP-BKO Boeing 737-500.jpgInvestigators have announced that there is no evidence of an engine fire in the wreckage of Aeroflot-Nord Flight 821, which crashed on September 14 in Perm, killing the 88 on board. This contradicts earlier eyewitness statements which say one engine was aflame when the Boeing 737 crashed.Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) says the CFM International CFM56 engines kept operating up until impact. They also confirm the plane did not break up in the air. Instead, the investigation focus has shifted to some unusual movements that Air Traffic Control records indicate were made by the pilot.As announced earlier this week, the plane began to ascend instead of descend as it was cleared to do during final approach. After executing a missed approach procedure, the 737-500 then turned in the wrong direction before crashing.Efforts are continuing to analyse the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder, which were heavily damaged by a post-crash fire. It is hoped they will provide an insight as in to what the crew were up to during the flight's final moments.At least 151 passengers and an unknown number of crew on board a Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB) Boeing 727-200 have escaped after the aircraft crash landed in swampland in Bolivia.Local airline LAB had been operating the chartered passenger flight from La Paz to Cobija on behalf of Transporte Aereo Militar (TAM) when poor weather conditions caused the jet to be diverted. LAB has recently been handling excess passengers for TAM as an unusually severe rainy season has washed away many roads across the nation.A flight engineer said that during the flight the engines failed due to a mechanical problem. The plane came down in a swampy forest clearing approximately 2 miles (3.3km) from a runway at the new destination of Trinidad, 370 miles from the intended destination. Several passengers were injured in the accident, and all on board were taken to hospitals for checks. One pilot received a clavicle fracture.The plane was severely damaged, with the New York Times reporting that photographs of the scene showed at least one wing of the aircraft to have separated from the fuselage.Survivors confirmed this. Paolo Bravo, a Bolivian senator on board the plane, said to local radio network Erbol "We noticed the engines went out, and there was this calm... Then they told us, 'Crash positions! crash positions!' and it was just another two or three seconds before we hit... The plane fell, the wings broke off, but the fuselage was OK."Experts from the Auxiliary Aerial Navigation Service and an airport commented that it is possible that the soft mus in the area absorbed some of the impact forces, allowing the plane to be salvaged and returned to service. LAB's operations chief Gustavo Viscarra made a statement saying "The crew members did not suffer any problem and there is no blood... The airplane has minimum damages, there is no structural damage, there was not any fire nor smoke. It was a forced landing planned by the pilot and it was not caused by our enterprise's negligence nor lack of maintenance of our airplanes."Passenger numbers are unclear, with LAB reporting 151 and some media sources saying 155.An investigation has been launched. It has been established that an undisclosed technical problem prevented the plane from departing for an hour.Legal and financial difficulties have seen LAB suspend operations for almost a year, but the carrier has recently begun a limited return to charter services.A Basler BT-67, chartered from Canadian air carrier Kenn Borek Air for the National Science Foundation (NSF), a United States government agency, has crashed whilst attempting take-off during a support assignment in Antarctica. None of the ten people on board were injured, but the modified Douglas DC-3 was substantially damaged in the accident.The accident occurred on the morning of December 20 local time, about 550 miles from McMurdo Station, a US-run Antarctic base. The aircraft was carrying a crew of four, and six researchers. The flight was part of the Polar Earth Observatory Network project, which is part-funded by the NSF. The project sets up GPS equipment and seismic sensors in various locations across Antarctica, in order to monitor changes in the ice sheets that cover the continent. It is thought that this will aid understanding of global warming.Although the NSF refused to publicise any details of the crash, one anonymous passenger has come forward about the accident, releasing his account in the form of an online report. According to the passenger, one side of the plane failed to lift off, and the aircraft's wing subsequently dug into the ice."My seat came unbolted from the floor with me still strapped into the seatbelt," the passenger said. "When we finally came to a halt, we were all in big pile in the corner of the plane with all of the equipment. We got shaken up pretty bad, but there were no major injuries other than some minor cuts and bruises... The wings, props, and tail all got bent up pretty bad. The landing gear, skis, and hydraulic system all were ripped from the plane and strewn about the ice."Following the accident, all those on board spent about twenty hours before they were flown back to McMurdo Station on board two Twin Otter aircraft sent from the base on a rescue mission. A full investigation has been launched into the crash by the Department of the Interior's Aircraft Management Division (AMD), who have signed a memorandum of agreement with NSF to conduct any necessary investigations on their behalf. The AMD have subsequently contacted the United States National Transportation Safety Board, who will participate in conjunction with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.Two hangars at the Kennedy Space Center in which space shuttles are processed were evacuated when a leak of hydrazine was detected coming from Atlantis's Orbital Maneuvering System. The leak was first discovered in Bay No 1, where Atlantis is being post-flight serviced. Nearly 150 people were evacuated from Bay No. 1 hangar and Bay No 2. Both the space shuttle Atlantis and Endeavour were inside the hangar when the leak was detected.Hydrazine is a toxic fuel which combines with nitrogen tetroxide to provide power for the shuttle's two maneuvering engines while it is in space. A concentration of 60 parts per million was detected near Atlantis's engines, which is not a dangerous level."That's not what we consider a dangerous level. But with any reading above zero, we would take precautionary measures and evacuate the facility," said Jessica Rye, a spokeswoman for Kennedy Space Center.NASA said that no workers were exposed to fumes or injured."We wanted to make sure to take the employees who were around that area, make sure they were OK and there was no exposure to the hydrazine. Then what they'll do is make sure the bay is ready for people to go back, and I would anticipate if people aren't already back they will be shortly," added Rye.An oil platform owned by Mariner Energy has exploded in the Gulf of Mexico throwing thirteen people into the water, reports indicate. All thirteen men who fell into the water have been accounted for, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. No injuries were reported. Smoke was billowing from the oil rig named Vermilion 380, which is reported to still be on fire.The blast occurred at around 9:19 a.m., approximately 80 miles south of Vermilion Bay off the coast of Louisiana. The Coast Guard confirms the platform was producing oil and gas at the time it exploded. They earlier reported a one mile long and 100 foot wide oil sheen which was spotted at the site of the explosion shortly after authorities responded to the scene, but later backtracked saying they could not confirm the presence of a sheen. Coast Guard chief petty officer John Edwards of the US Coast Guard earlier said that the platform, "was not actively producing any product." Mariner Energy also released a statement earlier saying no oil sheen was spotted."In an initial flyover, no hydrocarbon spill was reported," said Mariner Energy in a press release following the explosion. "The cause is not known, and an investigation will be undertaken. During the last week of August 2010, production from this facility averaged approximately 9.2 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 1,400 barrels of oil and condensate." According to Bureau of Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement spokesperson Melissa Schwartz, the platform was authorized to produce natural gas and oil at those depths, but "there were ongoing maintenance activities underway" which caused it to stop producing. The platform sits in about 2,500 feet of water, though some reports put the platform in 340 feet of water.As a result of the explosion and fire, Bobby Jindal, the governor for the state of Louisiana said that the Vermillion 380 platform had been "shut" and that oil flowing from the bottom of the Gulf has been stopped. At least 6 other platforms are said to be connected to the well that Vermilion 380 was part of. Jindal also said the fire was burning due to flammable materials on the platform. Apache Corporation, which has agreed to, but has not yet completed a merger with Mariner Energy, did not comment on whether the explosion would have any effect on the deal. The vice-president Bob Dye told Wikinews that "Apache and Mariner agreed to merge in April, 2010, however, the transaction has not yet closed so Mariner remains the operator of this platform".All 13 people have been rescued by an oil support vessel and have been transported to a nearby platform. Edwards earlier told MSNBC that all those who were in the water were "wearing some sort of an immersion suit that protects them from the water. Right now we're focused on search and rescue and then, ultimately, as this thing progresses we're going to be looking into the cause." The explosion comes only four months after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig run by BP exploded in April, resulting in a massive oil spill. The platform is located about 200 miles west of the Deepwater incident.No survivors were found today when searchers reached the crash site of PMTair Flight U4 241 in Cambodia, a government minister said."All have died. It is confirmed," Information Minister Khieu Kanharith told reporters.The wreckage of the PMTair Antonov An-24 was spotted by a helicopter crew early this morning, two days after the plane went missing from radar screens while on a flight from Angkor International Airport in Siem Reap to the beach-resort town of Sihanoukville.The crash site is located in the Dâmrei Mountains, or Elephant Mountains, northeast of Bokor Hill Station in Kampot Province, about 150 kilometers south of Phnom Penh, the capital.Rescue helicopter pilot Tep Sitha, speaking to Reuters by mobile telephone, described the crash site as "high on the mountain."A search operation involving around 1,000 people had scoured the mountainous jungle territory since the plane crashed on Monday. Monsoon rains, thick jungle and rugged terrain had hampered the search.The 44-seat plane had 22 people aboard – 16 passengers, plus a flight crew of six – a Russian pilot, two Cambodian co-pilots, a Cambodian flight engineer and two Cambodian flight attendants. Among the passengers, 13 were from South Korea and three were from the Czech Republic.Around a dozen Korean family members arrived in Phnom Penh yesterday from Seoul, and the Cambodian government said it would pay for their accommodations.The cause of the crash is yet to be determined by an examination of the flight data recorder, but officials had earlier speculated that weather may have played a part.The airline, PMTair, is a small Cambodian carrier that listed its fleet at five planes, including two Antonov An-24s, which it used for domestic flights. The type of Soviet-built plane, introduced in 1963, is common in Cambodia's civil and military aviation fleet.Sar Sareth, director of PMTair, told the Associated Press yesterday that he did not know what year the crashed plane was built. He said it was in "good condition" before taking off, and "was always in compliance with flight technical and safety procedures."The airline had begun regularly scheduled Siem Reap-Sihanoukville flights in January, providing a direct link between the two popular tourist towns.In addition to domestic service, PMTair has international routes, including direct flights from Seoul to Siem Reap, feeding a large influx of tourists from South Korea in the past few years. Last year, around 250,000 South Koreans visited the country. Yesterday, a South Korean government agency said it was putting PMTair on a list of carriers it was checking for safety. "As PMT also does business at Incheon International Airport, a special safety inspection for the airline will be carried out until July 6," Chung Sang-ho, head of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency.One other Cambodian carrier, Royal Khmer Airlines, was also on the South Korean list, as was Garuda Indonesia, and three Russian carriers, SAT Airlines, Vladivostok Air and Dalavia. Before Monday's crash, the worst incident for PMTair was a hard landing in 2005, when a piece of landing gear snapped off an An-24 on landing at Banlung, Ratanakiri, overcrowded with 59 passengers aboard. There were no injuries, but the airline was temporarily grounded after the incident. In another incident, a plane had to return to the airport after takeoff because of engine failure.The crash is Cambodia's first major aviation accident in nearly 10 years. In September 1997, a Vietnam Airlines Tupolev Tu-134 crashed while trying to land in heavy rain at Phnom Penh International Airport, killing 65 people and one person, a toddler, surviving.Tsunami warnings were issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and later canceled after a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the Andaman Islands near India. The quake struck 260 kilometers (160 miles) North of Port Blair in the Andaman Islands at approximately 1:55 a.m. local time with a depth of 33.1km (20.6 miles). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says it's likely the quake was an aftershock to the deadly magnitude 9.1 earthquake in 2004 that triggered a massive tsunami killing nearly 230,000 people.The warnings had applied to Myanmar, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The NOAA indicated the risk of a tsunami was 'moderate to high', but no waves were reported in any of the areas indicated in the warning."Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated. Therefore the tsunami watch issued by this center has been canceled," said the NOAA earlier in a statement on its website.Minutes after the quake, at 2:07 a.m. Indian time, the USGS said a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck 31 kilometers (19 miles) south-southwest of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, with a depth of 26.8 km (16.7 miles). However, officials in Japan put the quake at a magnitude 6.6. A tsunami watch was also issued for the area and a short time later small, a two foot rise in sea level was reported in the Tsuruga Bay area. A 10 inch rise in sea level was also reported in Yaizu City. As a precaution, Japanese officials have shut down at least two units, reactor No. 4 and 5 at the nuclear power facility in Hamaoka to perform a safety check. Alarms inside the plant indicated a possible radiation leak inside reactor 5, but officials say no radiation has been detected outside containment. According to Japan's Trade Ministry, both reactors shut down automatically after sensors detected the quake. Area trains have also been stopped. This was the second earthquake in Japan in two days, following an earlier one that measured 6.9 near Tokyo.There are no reports of major damage with either quake. In Japan, some windows broke and roof tiles dislodged from roofs. Spokesman for the USGS, Paul Caruso, says both quakes appear to be unrelated. Minor injuries were reported in Japan due to falling objects, but there are no reports of any deaths.  Singer, songwriter and actress Jessica Simpson, who flew to Japan over the weekend, is also safe after feeling the shaking."Thought I was hallucinating during a 6.6 earthquake in Japan. I have never felt anything like this in my life," said Simpson from via her Twitter account.Indonesia has also seen an earthquake, a 5.7 magnitude that occurred 74km from Wewak at 1:46 a.m. local time on Monday.British writer Doris Lessing, recipient of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, has said in an interview that the terrorist attack on September 11 "wasn't that terrible" when compared to attacks the Irish Republican Army (IRA) made on Britain."September 11 was terrible, but if one re-examines the history of the IRA, what happened in the United States wasn't so bad," Lessing told leading Spanish daily publication El Pais. "Some Americans believe I'm crazy. Many people died, two prominent buildings fell, but it was neither as terrible nor so extraordinary as they think."Do you know what people forget? That the IRA attacked with bombs against our government; it killed several people while a Conservative congress was being held and in which the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was (attending). People forget," She says, adding a comment that the Americans are "a very naive people, or they pretend to be."The IRA spent decades in armed guerrilla warfare against the United Kingdom, but officially ended its militaristic practices in 2005, after a lengthy peace process. The violence in Northern Ireland killed approximately 3,700 people and horrendously injured tens of thousands. By way of comparison, about 3,000 people were killed during 9/11.She goes on to criticize former prime minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair and his ally current President of the United States of America George W. Bush. "I always hated Tony Blair, from the beginning. Many of us hated Tony Blair, I think he has been a disaster for Britain and we have suffered him for many years. I said it when he was elected: This man is a little showman who is going to cause us problems and he did." "As for Bush, he's a world calamity," Lessing continues "Everyone is tired of this man. Either he is stupid or he is very clever, although you have to remember he is a member of a social class which has profited from wars."Iran also comes in for criticism. Lessing's parents currently reside in Bakhtaran, Iran. "I hate Iran, I hate the Iranian government, it's a cruel and evil government. Look what happened to its president in New York, they called him evil and cruel in Colombia University. Marvelous! They should have said more to him! Nobody criticizes him, because of oil."In the wake of last month's floods, North Korea has agreed to accept aid from South Korean donors as well as international organisations. This signifies an apparent change of heart the North Korean leadership, which as recently as last month had insisted they would handle everything itself.Local North Korean sources put the number of deaths from the floods at 547 and a few hundred missing, however Good Friends, a South Korean private aid agency, estimates the numbers may be more than hundred times that and top 57,700 deaths. Good Friends, citing "many sources" inside North Korea, also estimates more than 2.5 million homeless and hundred of thousands of acres of farmland had been inundated.Initially the aid from United Nations World Food Program will cover 150 tonnes of food to feed 13,000 people for a month in North Korea's worst hit northern Songchon county. South Korea has pledged an additional $72 million.In related news North Korean infant mortality reached 21 for every 1000, one of the highest in the world, mostly due to malnutrition and poor medical conditions.An oil rig in the North Sea has been evacuated after a security alert.Up to 539 oil workers are being moved off the affected rig in an operationthat began at 09:20 UTC this morning.Barry Nielson, a Squadron leader with the RAF was quoted (BBC News) as saying"It's unusual, that's probably the best way to describe it. But it falls within our normal operating procedures and we are reacting accordingly."By the end of the day, the alert had ended, with Kathy McGill (manging director of the firm responsible for the rig) being quoted as saying "We are very relieved that this has turned out to be a false alarm, but we obviously had to treat it seriously and act appropriately to ensure the safety and well being of all our people."On Wednesday at 12:40 p.m. CET (UTC+1), Norwegian authorities were alerted to an oil spill in the Statfjord oil field. The spill originated from the oil platform "Statfjord A", one of three platforms in the field, operated by StatoilHydro.Kristin Hoffmann of Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (Petroleumtilsynet) told Dagens Nyheter: "This is the second largest in Norwegian history." The amount of oil released into the sea is believed to be at least 3840 cubic metres, 25,000 barrels, or approximately 4,000 metric tons. This amount would rank the spill low on the list of oil spills."It is a significant amount and we are taking it seriously," said Vegar Stokset, a spokesman for StatoilHydro, though he said the spill was "very far from land." The accident occurred in rough seas while tanker Navion Britannia was loading oil from a storage buoy, StatoilHydro said. Christian Sletner of the Norwegian Coastal Administration said, "StatoilHydro has a good preparedness plan, and a satisfactory system for handling this." He added, "StatoilHydro is responsible for cleaning up. This is the 'polluter pays' principle.""The amount of damage could range from completely marginal to relatively large if substantial amounts reach land," Sletner said. "The chances of it reaching land, at the moment, seem to be relatively small."No one was injured at the time of the accident and the platform will continue work as usual Thursday, said StatiolHydro Information Director Kai Nielsen. In a press release, StatiolHydro announced that four vessels are on their way to begin the clean-up, though they will have to wait for calmer seas to begin work.Petroleum Safety Authority Norway said in a press release that it is demobilizing disaster teams and beginning to prepare for its investigation of the incident. It will also closely follow StatoilHydro's clean-up.Statfjord is 200 km (124 miles) off the coast of Norway, located to the east of Bergen. It is an oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, though approximately 15% of it is in the United Kingdom's waters. At peak production, it produces over 700,000 barrels of oil per day. The field is one of the largest known under-sea oil fields in the world.A magnitude 7.2 earthquake has hit the region of Tohoku, a rural area of Northern Japan, killing nine people, injuring over 200, triggering land slides with reports of a bridge destroyed by the quake, several press reports. Mainichi Shinbun reports many land slides happened in mountainous areas, cutting down roads and several neighborhoods are separated from the others.       The quake struck at 8:43 am local time, located about 5 miles (8 km) underground, approximately 280 miles (451 km) north of Tokyo in the northern prefecture of Iwate, which was felt as far away as the Capital. Mainichi indicated that Iwate and Miyagi Prefectures are severely damaged so that both governors invoke Disaster Aid Act to be effective in  Ichinoseki and Kurikoma respectively.    Japan is particularly prone to earthquakes due its position on the Ring of Fire as well as being made of volcanic islands. An earthquake last year caused a radioactive leak from the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant.The roof of Notre Dame cathedral in French capital Paris caught fire yesterday. The spire and at least part of the roof, and at least part of the wooden frame, collapsed. According to officials, the two bell towers were saved. The fire reportedly started at about 19:00 local time (1700 UTC). Reportedly over 400 firefighters participated in extinguishing the blaze and were still working as of midnight. Not only did they put out the fire but they continued to cool the structure after the fire was gone to reduce the possibility of further damage.Officials cleared the area around the cathedral.The French Civil Security service said water bombing by aircraft was disallowed as it might have caused additional damage to the monument.As of late yesterday, the fire's cause had not been officially stated. President Emmanuel Macron cancelled an address he was to have given during the evening and instead went to the scene.Renovation work was ongoing in the building before the fire began. The world-famous cathedral, completed in the 13th century, is one of the most well-known monuments in France.The American National Transportation Safety Board has announced that it will make new airline safety recommendations. This comes a result of its investigation into the Comair Flight 5191 disaster, in which a Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) CRJ-100ER crashed whilst attempting take-off from the wrong runway at Blue Grass Airport, Lexington, killing 49 people and leaving just one survivor. The plane was unable to take off because that runway was too short.The NTSB has now announced that, on July 26, the date on which the NTSB is to determine the probable cause of the accident, they will issue safety recommendations regarding methods of preventing a recurrence of the disaster.One of the recommendations will concern developing and implementing a cockpit-based system that will inform pilots when they are in the wrong location. Another will involve rescheduling the workloads of Air Traffic Controllers to ensure they receive more sleep, a request they had previously made in April.Regarding location warning systems, the FAA has pointed out that they have been working on methods of preventing runway incursions (in which a person, ground vehicle or another aircraft is on the runway when or where it should not be), to which the National Transportation Safety Board chairman Mark Rosenker responded "The FAA is doing a great job testing these systems. The question we have is, when will you finally implement that technology?" FAA Associate Administrator Margaret Gilligan responded by saying that they were currently looking at just such a system, adding "We do have airlines that have committed to put that technology on the flight deck once it's approved". The system referred to involves runway signal lights and is currently being tested at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.The NTSB will also look at runway and taxiway markings and the ways they can confuse pilots, as this issue has been identified as a contributing factor in the accident. Rosenker said the NTSB was "very interested" in this area. 140 airports have unclear or confusing markings in the US, but it is not certain if Blue Grass Airport is one of them. However, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) made a submission to the NTSB stating that they had found that the markings at Blue Grass Airport did not match those on the charts the pilots were using. ALPA went on to recommend greater standardisation of airport runway markings.Blue Grass Airport responded yesterday by saying that there was nothing wrong with their runway markings, with spokesman Brian Ellestad saying "We have had numerous inspections before and after (the Comair crash) and have had no issues... FAA reiterates that we meet all requirements for signage, markings, lighting, runways and taxiways."The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has issued an update in its investigation of a serious runway incursion in Pennsylvania in September. A regional jet with sixty people on board aborted takeoff and swerved to avoid a light plane, missing it by an estimated ten feet.The event occurred at Allentown's Lehigh Valley International Airport. A Canadair CRJ-700, operated by Mesa Airlines as Flight 7138, received clearance for takeoff but aborted the maneuver at 120 knots (138 mph), skidding around a Cessna 172R that had just landed and was still taxiing on the runway.  The crew of the Mesa Air regional jet estimated the distance between the two aircraft as 10 feet when they passed.The Mesa Air crew decided to abandon the flight. They returned the aircraft for inspection, but no damage was found. The incident occurred at night.The NTSB also released a photo of the tire marks left by the jet after the incident, showing that a violent swerve occurred. A detailed timeline has been released, as shown below:7:29:28 - Cessna contacts Allentown tower while about 8 miles east of the airport.7:33:30 - Cessna, in landing pattern for runway, is cleared to land on runway 6.7:34:50 - Mesa Air regional jet contacts tower and reports ready for takeoff and holding short of runway 6.  Controllerinstructs pilot to hold short of runway 6 for landing traffic. 7:36:15 - Cessna crosses threshold of runway 6 and lands.7:36:27 - Mesa Air instructed by tower controller to taxi into position on runway 6 and hold.7:36:36 - Tower controller asks pilot of Cessna where he intends to park. Following pilot response, controller provides taxi directions, instructing pilot to exit runway at taxiway A4.7:37:11 - Mesa Air cleared for takeoff. 7:37:18 to 7:37:32 - Controller turns attention to an inbound aircraft and issues landing instructions.7:37:34 - Cessna pilot informs tower controller that he had missed the A4 taxiway and asks for permission to exit at taxiway B.7:37:42 - Controller replies, "...no delay, turn immediately," which Cessna pilot acknowledges.7:38:16 - Mesa Air radios tower controller: "We got it, tower - we're going to need to go back to the gate." Following the incident, both aircraft taxied to parking.The NTSB has interviewed both pilots from the jet's four-person crew, the Cessna's pilot, the air traffic controllers on duty and the Federal Aviation Administration control tower managers. The investigation continues.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the agency responsible for investigating transportation accidents in the United States, released updates on three major investigations on June 14.The NTSB, well known publicly for its involvement in the investigation of aviation incidents which involve harm or loss of human life, is also an agency that oversees the transportation of refined petroleum and gas products, chemicals and minerals. The agency determined the cause of a natural gas pipeline explosion that killed six. It also detailed the cause of an accidental release of 204,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia from a pipeline in an environmentally sensitive area, and released preliminary information involving two commercial aircraft coming within 30-50 feet of each other on a runway.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that the captain of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which crashed nearly a year ago outside Buffalo, New York during its approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport, "inappropriately responded to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the aeroplane did not recover," according to a statement issued by the NTSB.The flight, operating as a codeshare with Continental Airlines under their Continental Connection brand, crashed last year on February 12, 2009 in Clarence Center, New York. The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, crashed into a residence killing everyone on board as well as one on the ground.The NTSB has blamed pilot error and poor training for the crash, noting that the plane's captain, Marvin Renslow, "had not established a good foundation of attitude instrument flying skills early in his career, and his continued weaknesses in basic aircraft control and instrument flying were not identified and adequately addressed." Renslow's career spanned two decades and had failed five performance checks during that time. Colgan Air was only aware of three. Colgan said had they known about the other two, they would not have hired Renslow in 2005. Colgan Air responded to the NTSB report in a letter: "They [the pilots] knew what to do in the situation they faced that night a year ago, had repeatedly demonstrated they knew what to do, and yet did not do it. We cannot speculate on why they did not use their training in dealing with the situation they faced." The Board added that Renslow's response to the "stick shaker activation should have been automatic, but his improper flight control inputs were inconsistent with his training and were instead consistent with startle and confusion. The 24-year-old first officer, Rebecca Lynne Shaw, was noted for her young age and lack of experience.The Board also concluded that "the pilots' performance was likely impaired because of fatigue." Renslow and Shaw had spent the night at the crew lounge at Newark Liberty International Airport in violation of Colgan Air's company policies. However, the board voted down making fatigue a contributing factor. Shaw, the first officer, had flown the previous night on two separate planes from the Pacific Northwest where she lived with her parents. Shaw also appeared to be suffering from a bad cold.However, the report also criticized Colgan saying that the airline, "did not pro-actively address the pilot fatigue hazards associated with operations at a predominantly commuter base." Adding that, "Operators have a responsibility to identify risks associated with commuting, implement strategies to mitigate these risks, and ensure that their commuting pilots are fit for duty."Another factor brought up the by the NTSB was the violation of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) sterile cockpit rule. It was noted that first officer Shaw had sent two text messages before take-off at Newark. The second message was sent two minutes before take-off.Prior to landing, the cockpit voice recorder recorded that the pilots were holding a conservation that potentially distracted the captain from operating the plane. Robert Sumwalt, a member of the NTSB board said, "It was continuous and one-sided, with the captain doing most of the talking." He added, "It was as if the flight was just a means for the captain to conduct a conversation with this young first officer." The chairwoman of the NTSB, Deborah Hersman, has noted that electronic devices are becoming a hazard to transportation. Hersman said, "Recent NTSB investigations have identified personal wireless technology use on the job. This phenomenon is becoming more widespread, and these phone calls, texts and other distractions have deadly consequences and must be addressed with all due haste by the transportation industry."The agency noted that distractions from electronics have played a part in many recent accidents and incidents, such as the August 2009 mid-air collision between a small private Piper aeroplane and a tour helicopter over the Hudson River in New York City killing all involved. The NTSB noted that one of the air traffic controllers was making a phone call and failed to warn the aircraft of the conflict that existed between each other in their airspace. However, this was disputed by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association which represents air traffic controllers nationwide. The NTSB later retracted some of its statements.The other notable incident was that of Northwest Airlines Flight 188 in October, that overshot its destination of Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport by 150 miles (241 km) before the pilots noticed. The pilots claimed they were checking schedules on their laptop computers in violation of basic piloting rules, the sterile cockpit rule and the policy of Delta Air Lines, who had recently acquired Northwest.The NTSB's last board meeting which was held two weeks ago, about the 2008 train collision between a Metrolink commuter rail train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, California also pertained to distractions by electronic devices. In the statement released by the NTSB for that meeting, the board stated that "according to records from the wireless provider, on the day of the accident, while on duty, both the Metrolink engineer and the Union Pacific conductor used wireless devices to send and receive text messages." The NTSB has recommended that audio and video recorders be installed in locomotive and control cabs because of the collision.In the wake of yesterday's earthquakes, Japan is today reporting that leaks at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant are worse than first reported.In addition to a leak of 315 gallons (1200 liters) of radioactive water into the Sea of Japan, reports say that drums with nuclear waste lost their lids and radioactive gases cobalt-60, chromium-51 and iodine were released into the atmosphere. Several pipes are also reported to have broken.Officials are also reporting 50 different problems at the plant of "malfunctioning and trouble," but officials would not comment further on the damage other than calling the issues "minor."New Zealand's Prime Minister, Helen Clark, was injured in a mid-air incident involving a Piper Aztec light aircraft above the Kapiti Coast around 9am local time.Preliminary reports suggest the cabin door popped open during extreme turbulence, which also caused a minor injury to the PM's elbow. Two police officers on board held the door closed while the plane made an emergency landing at Paraparaumu Airport, near Wellington."I had two New Zealand police with me who acted very, very quickly to grab the door and the two police officers were strong enough to hold the door right through the landing," Ms. Clark saidThe Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) will be investigating.No result as yet.A fire broke out at a record release party in Oakland, California late on Friday night. Nine were confirmed dead the following morning with the death toll rising to 24 the next day.The warehouse, known as Ghost Ship, was hosting a party for the release of the newest album by Joel "Golden Donna" Shanahan. It is in Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood, a mix of commercial and residential buildings nestled together. The structure is one block away from Fire Station No. 13 and at least 55 firefighters spent four hours containing and stopping the fire which began at approximately 11:30 p.m.Firefighters and police cordoned off the block to spectators. The two-story, mixed-use structure also housed the artist collective Satya Yuga who hosted the show and is being searched by firefighters. Out of approximately 50 attendees, at least 25 were declared missing. Shanahan was among the survivors.Efforts to rescue partygoers were compounded by the roof caving in during the inferno as well as the stacks of furniture, art pieces, and supplies which turned into obstacles for first responders.Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf:The structure is owned by Chor N. Ng, who is also the proprietor of several other buildings in the East Bay. On November 13 Ng was cited by the city for having stacks of garbage in and around the warehouse. Most fatalities were reported to have occurred in the upstairs portion of the building where escape was hampered by unstable stairs and miscellaneous art pieces lying in the way. The building lacked any smoke detectors and sprinklers; fire extinguishers were found outside of the premises.The presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee and Illinois state senator Barack Obama conveyed his sympathies and condolonces to the people of the Philippines through President Gloria Arroyo, after the country was struck over the weekend by Typhoon Fengshen.Obama also extended his regrets for not being able to meet Mrs. Arroyo who is on a 10-day official visit in the United States and met up with President George W. Bush at the White House.The senator from Illinois stressed the strong bond between the Philippines and the United States, taking note of the two countries partnership during the Cold War era and during the Second World War. Obama also pointed out that the Philippines is also an important ally in the on-going war on terror.He also expressed his desire on meeting Arroyo in the future and working closely with the people of the Philippines.He also urged the Bush administration to provide more aid to the Philippines in the wake of the retrieval of victims of Typhoon Fengshen who drowned or were lost at sea.Obama urged the "US government to provide emergency support to alleviate the suffering caused by the catastrophic natural disaster." Typhoon Fengshen lashed through the islands of the Philippines last June 21 to 22 causing mud floods, landslides and the capsizing of a passenger ferry, the MV Priness of the Stars, killing more than 700 passengers on board off the coast of Romblon island.The National Disaster Coordinating Agency of the Philippines reported that five days after the ferry tragedy, only 48 passengers survived and rescuers were able to retrieve 67 bodies.Transportation and Communications Secretary Leandro Mendoza also reported that 138 fishing vessels were reported missing as a result of Typhoon Fengshen.A cargo vessel, the MV Lake Paoay carrying 5,000 metric tons of coal from the mines in Semirara island was also lost off the coast of Iloilo province.According to Democratic Senator Mark Begich from Alaska, the U.S. Department of the Interior has decided to halt all new Arctic exploratory oil drilling applications until 2011. The response is believed to be caused in part by the two current oil spill disasters (that of the Deepwater Horizon Incident and more recently the Alaska oil pipeline malfunction). However, Begich is not happy about the actions taken by the White House. "I am frustrated that this decision by the Obama administration to halt offshore development for a year will cause more delays and higher costs for domestic oil and gas production to meet the nation's energy needs," Begich claims.Last September, the state of Alaska made a public notice about Shell's desire to drill off the coast of the Beaufort Sea, placing experimental drilling rigs at two drill site location: "Torpedo" and "Sivulliq"."Shell is committed to undertaking a safe and environmentally responsible exploration program in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea in 2010," said Shell Oil Company President Marvin E. Odum to the U.S. Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service (MMS).Odum follows with, "I am confident that we are ready to conduct the 2010 Arctic exploratory program safely and, I want to be clear, the accountability for this program rests with Shell."Chuck Clausen, director of the Alaska project at the Natural Resources Defense Council is not so optimistic: "Hazards present in the Arctic can include frigid temperatures, presence of sea ice, gale-force winds, intense storms and heavy fog ... The potential for loss in the Arctic is great."Odum believes that the climate in the arctic will make any spill easier to clean up because, "Arctic conditions create differences in responding to oil in cold and ice conditions.  Differences in evaporation rates, viscosity and weathering provide greater opportunities to recover oil.  In Arctic conditions, ice can aid oil spill response by slowing oil weathering, dampening waves, preventing oil from spreading over large distances, and allowing more time to respond."However, Clausen believes that there are no current systems to remove oil from icy ocean waters. This is not the first time that President Obama's administration has taken the environmentally cautious path in Alaska.  The President put Bristol Bay off limits to oil and gas exploration until 2017. Bristol Bay currently is one of the top salmon fishing grounds in the state.Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is expected to give a speech at Thursday's White House address, regarding the suspension of Arctic oil drilling projects.An object that fell through the roof of a New Jersey home in January was not a meteorite, according to Jeremy Delaney, a geologist at Rutgers University. Instead, it appears the object was space junk or orbital debris."Basically, it's a piece of stainless steel. There's huge amounts of material that have been left by the various space programs of the world," said Delaney.The meteorite shaped object was not from a naturally occurring substance and had a silver like reflection. It weighed about the same as a small can of soup, 13 ounces (about 370 grams), but was no bigger than a golf ball.Earlier during the incident, scientists from Rutgers examined the object visually along with police who were at the scene, and determined it was a meteorite. But further tests by geologists confirmed that it was not a meteorite, but probably a metal piece from a rocket or satellite. They had earlier thought it was made of iron."That's the nature of science. If the conclusion from the test says it's not a meteorite, then it's not a meteorite. We have to move forward," said Srinivasan Nageswaran, a member of the family that found the object.A police officer was killed after a motorcycle accident in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The officer, forty-year-old Germaine Casey, was driving his motorcycle in a motorcade as President Bush was leaving the city heading to the Albuquerque Airport following a fund raiser for Senator Pete Domenici.The vehicle was traveling at a high speed when it hit a curb, then crashed into a tree. Casey was taken to Albuquerque Hospital where he was pronounced dead.  President Bush passed the accident scene on his way out of Albuquerque. Bush issued a statement thanking the officer for his service. Trish Hoffman, of the Albuquerque Police Department, said the single vehicle crash was under investigation and that it was still too soon to pinpoint a cause.A British Royal Navy commander was reprimanded on Monday by a court martial, after pleading guilty to "failing to ensure the safe direction" of the submarine HMS Superb. Commander Steven Drysdale was in charge of the nuclear-powered submarine in May 2008, when it struck a rock pinnacle 132 metres below the surface. A navigation chart showed the pinnacle, but Drysdale said that he had misread its depth as 732 metres.Officer of the Watch Lieutenant-Commander Andrew Cutler and Navigating Officer Lieutenant Lee Blair were also reprimanded for their part in the incident by the court martial, held at the HMS Nelson centre at Portsmouth naval base.The £32 million submarine was in the Red Sea, heading for the Persian Gulf, and was suffering from technical problems at the time which were slowing it down. The officers decided to dive from 100m to 250m, which would allow them to travel faster and reach their destination on time.According to prosecutor Captain Stuart Crozier: "The three defendants all looked at the chart and the sub was taken to 250m. No thorough check was made to establish whether this depth was safe from obstacles."Lieutenant-Commander Cutler then realised that a change to the route could shorten it. “On assessing the chart, Officer of the Watch Cutler saw he could cut the corner of a dog-leg, saving about three to four miles," said Crozier. "He then instructed the plot officer to draw a new line on the chart. However Lieutenant-Commander Cutler did not check the depth around this new track.""Unfortunately, with the sub now dived to 250m, this new track went directly over a pinnacle which showed only 132m of available depth."The new route was plotted directly over the pinnacle on the chart, and the court martial was told that this made it harder to spot the error. None of the officers, including Commander Drysdale, realised that they had put the vessel on a collision course.HMS Superb struck the pinnacle at 10.01 on May 26, suffering damage to its bow and sonar equipment. There were no casualties, but the submarine was forced to abandon its mission and return to the United Kingdom. It was decommissioned in September 2008, though the Ministry of Defence said that this was not due to the accident.Commander Alison Towler, representing Drysdale, said that he accepted full responsibility and had "deep remorse and regret" over the incident. "He believes that due to the surrounding information he simply misread 132m as 732m" she said. "It was only later that he realised the plot officer had drawn the sub’s new transit straight through the pinnacle, which made it even harder for it to be seen."Navigating Officer Blair also pleaded guilty to failing to take into account all the dangers in or near the planned movements, and Officer of the Watch Cutler pleaded guilty to failing to supervise the plot officer adequately. All three officers will continue to serve in the Navy, but Drysdale has been moved to a desk job and will not be taking up the position in Washington DC he had planned to.Captain Philip Warwick, president of the court martial board, told the three: "It was indeed fortunate that no one was hurt and we note that the submarine could not complete its deployment in full. The failings were unacceptable and we take an extremely dim view of them."The Royal Navy has since brought in new procedures on submarines to prevent a repeat of the incident, requiring that all depths are rechecked when plotting a new route.On Monday Nigerian authorities raised the official death toll from January 17's airstrike upon a refugee camp to 236, though the BBC on Tuesday reported an official told them this was an error and the actual figure was 115. The military said at the time a jet mistook refugees for rebels.The new toll updates previous estimates, which at the time of the incident were of at least 50 dead. The BBC on Tuesday reported an official told them the figure of 236 was erroneously reached by combining the numbers of dead and wounded. The camp in Rann, Borno State is home to thousands and lies near the northeastern border with Cameroon.Home to those displaced by Boko Haram insurgents, the camp is in an area suffering famine. Farmers are unable to work owing to bombs on their land. The Red Cross was there to distribute food when the attack happened. Twenty Nigerian Red Cross workers were injured or killed. Médecins Sans Frontières are treating the majority of the wounded in makeshift tents in Rann, which lacks hospital facilities. A small number have been evacuated to Maiduguri.Military officials said at the time the Air Force had been dispatched to Rann after reports of "remnants" of Boko Haram in the area. The military claims it is in a "final push" against the rebel group. A promised investigation has materialised in the form of a panel of Air Force officials, with orders to complete the probe by the end of next week.Human Rights Watch have called for compensation for victims. They say the military is not absolved of liability and suggest the camp's tents were obvious. Eyewitnesses say the aircraft circled twice, dropping multiple bombs, which appears corroborated by satellite imagery. President Muhammadu Buhari called it a "regrettable operational mistake" and has since departed for a holiday in London.Journalists are barred from the military-controlled camp. Officials claim all the dead in Rann have been buried, and two more died in hospital in Maiduguri. Most of those killed were women and children. Soldiers were also amongst those killed. Eyewitnesses claim two days after the disaster in excess of 100 Boko Haram militants attacked the camp, fighting with soldiers for hours.MSF field co-ordinator Alfred Davies said, "There are no words to describe the chaos[...] I saw the bodies of children that had been cut in two." MSF have called for "a transparent account" with the organisation's general director complaining refugees "were bombed by those who were meant to safeguard them". Some humanitarian groups have suggested the incident constitutes a war crime even as an accident, and Human Rights Watch is urging an independent probe. They say 35 structures were destroyed at two separate locations within the camp."We saw dozens of patients with multiple traumatic injuries, including open fractures and wounds to the abdomen and chest," said MSF doctor Mohammed Musoke. He described wounded children, including a crying baby with shrapnel in its neck and "a 10-year-old boy with a large, deep flesh wound to his thigh. The flesh was hanging loose on one side and you could see through to the bone."Survivor Baba, 37, a refugee, said military aircraft were not an uncommon sight but the attacking jet behaved abnormally. "The plane flew back and forth, and we knew something was wrong before the bombing happened." His remarks were released by MSF.Prior to the attacks camp residents had been starving, some dying from malnutrition. War and substandard infrastructure left Rann isolated, and the attack came as the Red Cross were about to distribute food they had just arrived with. The Red Cross say they have five weeks' worth of food.The International NGO Safety Organisation claims 2016 saw in excess of 90 aid workers killed worldwide, with 154 injured.State run television in Myanmar has reported that the death toll from the recent cyclone has increased dramatically to 77,738. In addition to this, 55,917 people are still officially missing.In what are admittedly rough estimates, the United Nations (UN) estimates that more than 100,000 have died, while the International Red Cross projects 128,000 deaths. At least 10,000 people died just in Bogale Township in the Pyapon District of the country.The United Nations has reported that 2.5 million people are homeless, or in need of help in the Irrawaddy Delta.The military junta that governs the country says that it can handle relief operations and that they are going well. It is still turning down international offers to transport aid directly to the affected areas. According to state television, Prime Minister Thein Sein said, "We have already finished our first phase of emergency relief. We are going onto the second phase, the rebuilding stage.""Time is life," said Louis Michel, the European Commissioner for Development & Humanitarian Aid to reporters at Bangkok International Airport in Thailand. "No government in the world can tackle such a problem alone. This is a major catastrophe."Michel was returning from a trip to Yangon where he was unsuccessful at urging the junta to allow direct aid despite its pride and paranoia about the outside world.Aid groups, including UN agencies, say only a fraction of the required relief is getting through and, unless the situation improves, thousands more lives are at risk.According to The New York Times, the United States and some European allies had considered a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for "humanitarian intervention" in Myanmar, which would give authorization for a relief mission without approval of the military authorities in Myanmar. The idea was dismissed after it became clear that China would veto any such resolution. The US has a assembled number of ships, helicopters, transport airplanes and marines in the region, ready to assist in cyclone relief if given approval by the government of Myanmar. US officials say that helicopters can bring in assistance to areas inland from the coast and further help distribute supplies across the country. Myanmar has approved fewer than 20 cargo planes to bring supplies to the capital, Yangon.At the United Nations Headquarters, a row occurred when Myanmar's ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Tint Swe, interrupted the French ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert during a speech to the General Assembly. He accused France of sending a warship to Myanmar."It's not true," Ripert said. While the ship is operated by the French Navy, it is not a warship but a ship carrying 1500 tonnes of food and medicine, Ripert insisted. It also has small boats to reach the flooded Irrawaddy Delta. The ship will reach the coast of Myanmar on Saturday, awaiting approval to deliver aid.Meanwhile, the UN is sending John Holmes, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, to make contact with Myanmar's reclusive military leaders to improve UN access to the hardest-hit areas.According to UN spokesperson, Michèle Montas, Holmes will arrive in Myanmar on Sunday. He will be carrying a letter from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Senior General Than Shwe, who has twice previously refused to converse with Ban.A senior Afghan intelligence official has reported that a military aircraft crashed in the country's northern region on Thursday.Provincial intelligence chief Abdul Majid Azimi said that the aircraft went down in the mountains of Afghanistan's Baghlan province. He added it was not immediately known if the aircraft involved is a helicopter or a plane or to whom it belonged.Mohammad Asif Qazizada, the district governor of the Khinjan district, told the Agence France-Presse news agency: "a military aircraft has crashed in the Basgah area on the peak of the Salang mountains, between northern and southern Salang. It is not known at this stage to whom the aircraft belongs, exactly what type of aircraft it is, if there were any passengers and who they were."A spokesman for NATO's international coalition in Afghanistan said there were no immediate reports of a crash involving any of its aircraft."We are investigating reports of a military aircraft crash in Salang. We cannot confirm anything at this stage. We are investigating," said General Murad Ali Murad, an army corps commander.Officials said on Thursday, after analyzing data from the Germanwings Flight 9525 cockpit voice recorder, that the airbus crashed into the French Alps because its co-pilot deliberately crashed it.On the cockpit voice recorder, the captain can be heard trying to get back into the cockpit.  Transponder data indicates the autopilot was told to descend form 38,000 feet to 100 feet.  The last part of the recording contains screaming during the sudden decent.Investigators are still searching for the plane's flight data recorder.The co-pilot started training in 2008, and was diagnosed in 2009 with serious depression according to BBC News. Later he completed his training and passed all his tests to pilot, according to Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr.In light of this incident, several airlines announced a ban on leaving any one person alone in the cockpit.The flight path and altitude chart can be seen in the images below.Lebanon's transportation minster said that the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed into the Mediterranean Sea on Monday didn't follow the directions suggested by the air traffic control tower after departing from Beirut in a thunderstorm. He said that the aircraft turned opposite the heading indicated by controllers.All ninety people aboard Flight ET409, which was headed to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, were feared dead. The jet reportedly went down in fire at around 02.30 local time, disappearing from radar screens after leaving the airport."They asked him to correct his path but he did a very fast and strange turn before disappearing completely from the radar," commented Transportation Minister Ghazi Aridi. He added: "Nobody is saying the pilot is to blame for not heeding orders. There could have been many reasons for what happened. [...] Only the black box can tell."Defence Minister Elias Murr also commented that the plane didn't follow instructions upon takeoff. "A command tower recording shows the tower told the pilot to turn to avoid the storm, but the plane went in the opposite direction. We do not know what happened or whether it was beyond the pilot's control."Ethiopian Airlines' CEO, Girma Wake, however, countered Aridi's comments, saying that it is too soon to draw any conclusions. "Rushing remarks, I don't think that helps anybody," he said in the Ethiopian capital.Lebanese officials, meanwhile, have ruled out foul play as being the cause of the aircraft's crashing. The Associated Press quoted Ethiopian Airlines as saying that the pilot in control of the downed plane had twenty years of experience, although it did not disclose his name.According to an unnamed aviation analyst, Lebanon controllers were directing the Ethiopian flight for the first two to three minutes of the flight due to the thunderstorms, and noted that this was standard procedure during inclement weather.US-based airline pilot Patrick Smith remarked that the plane could have crashed for many reasons. "Had the plane encountered extreme turbulence, or had it suffered a powerful lightning strike that knocked out instruments while penetrating strong turbulence, then structural failure or loss of control, followed by an in-flight breakup, are possible causes."Seventeen insurgents were killed in clashes with security troops in the Orakzai region of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Several rebels were injured in the attack according to officials. None of the soldiers were injured in the attack.Security personnel alleged that they had arrested a senior Taliban leader in the attack. Meanwhile, elders of various tribes demanded the government to bar security forces to carry out operations affecting the people of the Mishti Mela, Sanghra and Mishti Bazaar areas. They said that the government should have allowed the people some time to shift from the area before launching such attacks, claiming the air strikes in the region also killed some civilians.Also, three people were kidnapped in Ghalo Cheena area of Hangu on Friday according to witnesses. The three people were on their way home when unidentified men held them at gunpoint and kidnapped them. Police said they had not heard about the incident.Yesterday, oil facilities belonging to Saudi Arabia's state-owned Saudi Aramco were hit by multiple drone strikes in a pre-dawn raid. The attacks triggered major fires at a processing plant and an oil field, which state media said were under control. The Yemen-based Houthi movement claimed responsibility for the attacks.According to the Saudi Press Agency, the attacks occurred at 4:00 A.M. local time (0100 UTC) and struck the largest processing plant at Abqaiq and the Khurais oil field. The oil field is about 160 km (100 miles) east of the capital, Riyadh. The agency did not mention if there were casualties, but said exports were continuing.Reuters, citing anonymous sources, reported both production and export of oil had been disrupted. Saudi officials subsequently said 5.7  million barrels of per-day production had been disrupted. This would be nearly half of Saudi Arabia's entire production and around five percent on a global basis.Speaking on al-Masirah TV in Yemen, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said it had carried out the attack using ten drones. According to him, it was among the largest Houthi operations inside of Saudi Arabia and was accomplished with the help of "honourable people inside the kingdom"."These attacks are our right, and we warn the Saudis that our targets will keep expanding", Saree said. "We have the right to strike back in retaliation to the air strikes and the targeting of our civilians for the last five years."US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted a message on Twitter blaming Iran for the attacks, saying there was "no evidence the attacks came from Yemen." BBC's Jonathan Marcus said questions remain how much direct Iranian assistance is received by the Houthis who are ideologically aligned with Iran.In 2015, Saudi Arabia started supporting the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi against the Houthi rebellion, providing airstrikes with the Royal Saudi Air Force. The United Nations called the resulting humanitarian crisis the worst in the world.In 2006, Abqaiq was the target of an Al-Qaeda suicide attack.In the United Kingdom, an anti-pollution operation is under way after the stricken ship MSC Napoli started to leak dangerous heavy fuel oil.The heavy fuel oil that is leaking from the beached Italian ship is extremely dangerous for the environment. Fear of pollution increased after the ship was further damaged during storms last Thursday. MSC Napoli was beached by Devon coastguards after it suffered heavy structual damage in the gale force storms of Thursday, 18 January 2007, that wreaked havoc across Northern Europe. The ship, which contains 160 containers of hazardous chemical substances, is listing at 35 degrees.The entire 26-man crew was rescued by navy helicopters Thursday after severe gales. Cracks were found on both sides of the ship, but the current oil leak was not expected.Around 2,400 containers were carried by the 62,000 tonne ship, some of which contain potentially dangerous hazardous chemicals.The Coastguards have reported that up to 200 of the containers carrying materials such as perfume and battery acid are loose from the ship and they are looking for missing containers. South African stainless steel producer Columbus Stainless confirmed on Friday that there was at least 1,000 tonnes of nickel on board MSC Napoli.A hole in the ship flooded the engine room and there’s now fears that the ship will break up. Saturday MSC Napoli was towed to Portland when a ”structural failure” forced the salvage team to beach it. As the storms have continued MSC Napoli has been further damaged.The authorities have warned people about the pollution, which already has reached the beaches at Devon, but many want to see it on their own. Police have closed Branscombe Beach as more than 20 containers have broken up scattering their contents along the beach.Sky News reported Sunday that the costs of the accident might be very high as thousands of pounds worth of BMW motorbikes, car parts, empty oak barrels and perfume might get lost in flooding containers.200 people feared dead in an explosion at an oil pipeline near Lagos in Nigeria. Many of the bodies had been burnt beyond recognition. Firefighters were on the scene of the explosion at Ilodi; a fishing village 25 miles east of Nigeria's main city of Lagos, and Red Cross workers were helping survivors."There was a big fire and quite a number of people died," Red Cross spokeswoman Okon Umoh said. Many of the bodies had fallen into the water of the coastal village. The blast took place when villagers were scooping out fuel that was gushing out from a ruptured pipe.Nigeria is Africa's leading oil producer, the world's seventh-biggest exporter and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. But, most of the population lives in poverty. The pipelines often pass through poor communities, who break them to steal the precious oil. Nigeria has a history of pipeline disasters. At least 1000 people died in Jesse in a pipeline blast in October 1998.The explosion of an oil pipeline in San Martín Texmelucan de Labastida in central Mexico has killed at least 27 individuals and injured 56 others. Twelve of the dead are children. Over 100 homes were damaged and at least 30 of them were destroyed. The explosion had an estimated blast radius of three miles.Describing exploding gas tanks that flew through the air, Carlos Hipolito, who fled the scene with approximately 60 relatives, described the incident to Milenio Television as a "catastrophe". Living ten blocks from where the explosion occurred, 58-year-old Jose Luis Chavez explained that he had heard a minimum of two loud explosions and witnessed flames rising over 10 meters (30 feet) into the air.It is thought that at the Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) pumping station where the incident occurred, a gang of criminals were attempting to illegally tap crude oil from the pipeline when they punctured it. Valentin Meneses, Puebla state interior secretary, stated: "They lost control because of the high pressure with which the fuel exits the pipeline."Pemex has explained that the theft of oil from the pipelines causes them to lose hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Juan José Suárez Coppel, the head of the company, stated that the pipeline section near to the location of the blast was tapped illegally on 60 occasions. He also reported that across Mexico, 550 cases of illegal tapping had occurred.Expressing his condolences to the families of those that had died because of this incident, Mexican president Felipe Calderon stated that the federal government is to launch an investigation to try to establish the identities of the offenders and apprehend them.The oil rig Deepwater Horizon sank yesterday after an explosion Tuesday night that left eleven people missing.According to an officer from the US Coast Guard, the rig sank sometime in the morning. The rig had caught fire after an explosion of unknown origin occurred two days ago. 115 of the 126 workers on board the time of the explosion have been rescued after evacuating in lifeboats, either by the Coast Guard or from other ships in the area.The remaining eleven have not been located, although Coast Guard officials have expressed optimism that they are still alive.The environmental impacts of the explosion and subsequent sinking of the rig are unclear. While up to 13,000 gallons of crude oil per hour has been released from the rig, until now, the effects have been considered minimal, as it had been burned off in the fire. That does have the potential to change, though, according to David Rainey, vice president of the lessor of the rig, BP. The rig, built in 2001 by Hyundai Heavy Industries was owned and operated by Transocean.The rig was located roughly 50 miles southeast of the coast of Louisiana, and was under lease to BP since 2007. It was completing the construction of a new oil well, and was constructing a layer of cement in the well to reinforce it. This is considered dangerous, as it has the potential to produce an uncontrolled release of case, called a blowout. While the cause of the explosion has yet to be determined, a blowout is considered a possibility.One survivor of the explosion, who declined to give his name, told the The New York Times that he was laying in bed when the explosion happened. "It caught me by surprise. I’ve been in offshore 25 years, and I’ve never seen anything like that," he recalled.Stanley Murray, the father of another survivor named Chad, an electrician, said: "My son had just walked off the drill floor." However, Murray said that a neighbor did not make it in time, adding that his son told him that the missing eleven workers could not have made it out alive. "The eleven that’s [sic] missing, they won’t find them," Murray said.After an investigation, Wikinews has learned that oil spewing from a rupture in the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico on June 13 was 50 to 60 feet from the Deepwater Horizon leak.A nearly four and a half minute video posted on YouTube on June 13 was from the Viking Poseidon ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) 1. It shows oil and methane leaking from the seafloor at around 2:48 a.m. on June 13. The ROV monitors the leak for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot. Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled, making the leak locations vary from 50 to 60 feet from the damaged well.Until now, there was no way to determine the location of the ROVs in relation to the previously leaking Deepwater Horizon well. Alexander Higgins, an independent computer programmer, developed the 'Gulf Oil Spill ROV UTM Distance Calculator.' Using the coordinates for the location of the Deepwater Horizon, and the location of the Viking Poseidon on June 13, Wikinews was able to determine that the first rupture and leak was approximately 50.45 feet from the leaking well or "21.56 feet [n]orth and 45.61 feet [w]est" of the Deepwater leak point.Higgins told Wikinews how he created the calculator, and says it is "very accurate," but that the tool would "not give you accurate measurements over a large distance, e.g. from the well head to New Orleans.""This tool was created using java script that uses basic Pythagorean theorem (                              A                      2                          +                  B                      2                          =                  C                      2                                {\displaystyle A^{2}+B^{2}=C^{2}}  ) to calculate the distance between two points. The distance is simply                                           (                          N                              1                                      −                          N                              2                                                    )                              2                                      +            (                          E                              1                                      −                          E                              2                                                    )                              2                                                          {\displaystyle {\sqrt {(N_{1}-N_{2})^{2}+(E_{1}-E_{2})^{2}}}}  . ROV coordinates match the location within a few feet when looking at the well because obviously the ROV can not be over the exact center because that is where the BOP is," said Higgins.BP, who owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon, has denied that any oil or methane gas is leaking from the sea floor.  On July 16, Kent Wells, the senior vice president of BP, said on their official Twitter page that "4 ROVs using sonar scanning [are] looking for anomalies in seabed floor.  No indications any oil or gas escaping."  Seismic tests were conducted on July 16; Admiral Thad Allen of the United States Coast Guard said that "no anomalies" were found, but also that the tests were "not comprehensive."On Sunday, Wikinews contacted BP, who authenticated the video, and asked if any ROVs were sent back to the crack and leak location on June 13 for further investigation.  According to their office in London, England, they "sent ROVs to investigate and monitor that and no further signs of oil or gas were found."  They also stated that they "have continued to monitor" and "have also carried out seismic surveys.  Nothing found to give concern."  Wikinews also asked if they could confirm the location of the leak and crack, but no response was given.However, on July 18, the Associated Press reported that there was "seepage" coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head. For the past two days, ROV cameras showed bubbles coming from the base of well. BP said it would test the bubbles to determine what they are and as of Sunday, COO of BP Doug Suttles says the bubbles are not methane, but further tests are being conducted.  "If you can imagine, it is not an easy operation to collect those bubbles so that they can be tested to see what their make-up is."Since the June 13 video surfaced, other videos have been posted to YouTube allegedly showing some of the ROVs being tossed around by large amounts of oil seeping through the seafloor.  One video showed an alleged eruption spraying oil and debris around the BOA DEEP C 2 ROV before it was tossed from side to side.  It then immediately retreated to the surface.  Some of the cracks on ocean floors, where oil has leaked from, have occurred naturally.  One such oil spill in California in 2005 was the result of a naturally occurring crack in the floor of the Pacific Ocean.  Some of those cracks can cause oil to leak through at a rate as high as 5,000 gallons a day, with most of the oil not even reaching the water's surface.  In the Gulf of Mexico, oil leaks through natural cracks at a rate several times less than leaked from the Deepwater well."The Deepwater Horizon site releases 3 to 12 times the oil per day compared to that released by natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico. By May 30, the Deepwater Horizon site had released between 468,000 and 741,000 barrels of oil, compared to 60,000 to 150,000 barrels from natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico over the same 39 day period," said Cutler Cleveland, a Boston University professor at the university's  Department of Geography and Environment.The Deepwater Horizon oil spill started on April 20 after an explosion on the rig. Efforts to put out the fire failed and the rig subsequently sank to the bottom of the Gulf. On April 22, an oil slick appeared on the surface of the Gulf. BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf. The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap for 48 hours. Earlier on July 17, they announced the test would continue for another day. BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI. As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI. BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor."We are feeling more comfortable we have integrity. We will keep monitoring and make the decisions as we go forward. The longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it," said Allen.200,000 litres of oil leaked into waters off the coast of Brisbane from the Pacific Adventurer when their fuel tanks were damaged in rough seas on Wednesday.  The figure is about ten times higher than the original estimate of twenty thousand litres of oil.  The devastating diesel oil spill has spread along 60 kilometres (37 miles) of the Queensland coast.  In addition, 31 containers with 620 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser flew overboard during the violent storm.Questions are being asked why the Hong Kong cargo ship was out in seas with nine meter waves caused by Cyclone Hamish, a Category 5 tropical cyclone, as well as why the fertiliser containers were not properly secured. One of the overboard containers ruptured the hull of the Pacific Adventurer, causing between 30 to 100 tonnes of oil to spew from the severely damaged ship.  If the ammonium nitrate mixes with the heavy oil, an explosion could occur. None of the containers have been recovered. Some of these may float, but it is believed that they may have sunk which then may cause algal blooms.Disaster zones have been declared at Bribie and Moreton Islands, and along the Sunshine coast. The vessel's owner, Swire Shipping, reported that a second leak began on Friday, when the ship began listing after docking at Hamilton for repairs.  "As full soundings of the vessel's tanks were being taken at the port to determine how much oil had leaked from the vessel, a small quantity of fuel oil escaped from the Pacific Adventurer," it stated.  The ship was brought upright, and a recovery vessel was used to suck up the oil from the water.  The leak produced a 500m-long oil slick down the Brisbane River.  Booms were placed around this oil spill so that a skimmer could clean up the second spill.Swire Shipping could face clean up costs of AU$100,000 a day as well as fines up to AU$1.5million (US$977,000; £703,000) if found guilty of environmental breaches or negligence.Sunshine Coast beaches are slowly starting to be reopened.  The beach of Mooloolaba was still closed following reports of burning sensations from swimmers.  12 beaches remain closed; however, 13 have been reopened.Over 300 state government and council workers are using buckets, rakes and spades in the clean up effort.  Sunshine Coast Mayor Bob Abbott says the majority will be gone by Sunday afternoon.  The full environmental impact on wildlife is not yet known.  One turtle and seven pelicans have been found covered in oil.There are concerns that the drinking water of Moreton Island is at risk, as the island uses water from the underground water table near the oil spill site."Every bucketload of contaminated sand has to be removed from the island by barge, and each bucketload from a front-end loader weighs about one tonne. It's just an impossible task,” said Mr Trevor Hassard of the Tangalooma Dolphin Education Centre.The commercial fishing industry has suffered from the incident. Trawlers won't resume operations until Sunday evening, and any catches will be tested for human consumption.800 miles of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were closed down following a spill of thousands of barrels of crude oil south of Fairbanks, Alaska. A power failure following a routine fire-command system test caused relief valves to open and crude oil overflowed near the Fort Greely pump station 9.  The valves opening allowed a pressure release for the system and oil flowed on a pad to a tank that can hold 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons).  As of Wednesday afternoon, the tank vents were still leaking probably from thermal expansion inside the tank. Another secondary containment area below the tanks capable of holding 104,500 barrels was not yet filled to capacity. The spill coordinator for the Department of Environmental Conservation, Tom DeRuter, said that the oil spill contamination should be confined to the graveled oil containment liner.  "Safety is their No. 1 objective right now.  As soon as it is safe to move in, then they'll get the power on and try to empty that tank out. As long as everything is in that liner, it gives us time," DeRuter explained.40 people had been evacuated from the Fort Greely site, and the Prudhoe Bay station has been reduced by 84%.  "We're going to take as long as we need to make sure the site is safe before we start back up," said Alyeska Pipeline Service Company spokesperson Michele Egan.  There is capacity in reserve tanks for 48 hours during this slow down of production.About 650,000 barrels per day run through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline between Prudhoe Bay to the Port of Valdez oil tankers.  The majority of shares in Alyeska are held by BP Exploration, Alaska (BPXA) which is also currently addressing the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.BP addressed a 267,000 gallon crude oil spill in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in 2006 resulting in a lawsuit against BP Exploration.As reports came out yesterday that the oil spill caused by the explosion and sinking of an oil rig in Gulf of Mexico near Louisiana had reached the coast, the Obama administration announced a ban on all future offshore drilling at least until the investigation into the incident is completed.Early Friday morning, the US Coast Guard received reports that oil from the spill had washed ashore, and while officials have not confirmed the reports, winds continue to push the slick northward towards land, and conditions are deteriorating, making cleanup of the spill increasingly difficult.  The Coast Guard said it was planning to conduct a flyover of the slick to determine its extent sometime on Friday. According to the National Weather Service, strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted to continue through the weekend, hindering cleanup efforts.Also early on Friday morning, a senior government official, White House advisor David Axelrod, said that the government was immediately banning all new offshore drilling until the investigation into the spill had been completed.  His announcement came just after a month the administration relaxed restrictions of offshore drilling. The operation to clean up the spill has accelerated in recent days, with the US Navy having joined the effort, as well as resources from the Coast Guard and British Petroleum (BP), the lessor of the rig at the time of the explosion.  The total assets deployed in the operation are estimated to be around 1,900 people and more than 300 ships and aircraft.  Additionally, six remotely operated submarines are trying to stem the leaks, which now number three, at the ocean's floor.On Wednesday, the estimated amount of oil spilling from the damaged well was raised to 5,000 barrels, or around 210,000 gallons, a day, five times the original estimate of 1,000 barrels a day.  This figure was later revised upwards again to 25,000 barrels (1.05 million gallons) per day. So far, the cleanup operation has laid around 210,000 feet of containment booms to protect vulnerable wildlife refuges on the Gulf Coast, and an additional 66,000 feet of boom has been provided by the US Navy.  Since the beginning of the operation, more than 18,000 gallons of an oil/water mix have been recovered from the ocean, and after a successful test burn of oil, plans are being made to scale the burns up.  According to a BP official, "We believe we can now scale that up and burn between 500 and 1,000 barrels at a time." The first test burned around 100 barrels of oil.Despite the efforts, many are still worried about the potential consequences of the spill, and officials said that the damage could end up being more than that caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill 20 years ago, which spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. One analyst said that he expected "that movement is going to continue to stress and fatigue the pipe and create more leaks," adding that "this is not on a good trajectory."BP has developed two options to stop the flow of oil at the source, but both are expected to take at least weeks to complete. The first option is to lower large structures over the leak, which would allow the oil to be safely transported to the surface. BP is building one such structure, but it isn't expected to be completed for at least several weeks.  The second option is to drill a second well which would then plug the leak at the source. A well for this purpose will begin to be drilled within two days, although it could be up to three months before the leak is completely plugged.A fierce storm on Sunday resulted in massive 18-foot waves, which split a Russian oil tanker in two and sank two Russian freighters nearby. The tanker spilled at least 560,000 gallons of fuel into a strait which leads to the Black Sea, and officials say it may take years to clean up. The tankers sank in the Strait of Kerch, which links the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in the northeast. The two ships were carrying a total of around 7,150 tons of sulfur, according to Sergei Petrov, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations regional spokesperson.The tanker was carrying nearly 1.3 million gallons of fuel oil, and was stranded several miles from shore. Emergency workers were prevented from collecting the spilled oil immediately due to stormy weather; the head of the state environmental safety watchdog Rosprorodnadzor, Oleg Mitvol, said "there is serious concern that the spill will continue". Workers eventually managed to begin work on cleaning up the spill, an effort which may be long-term. Tar-like sands laden with oil and seaweed were piled on the shore, while oil-covered birds in slick-covered water tried to flap their wings. Regional coast guard officer Anatoly Yanhuck said once weather improves they will begin pumping oil from the tanker, then tow the ship to port.Two fuel-loaded barges and Turkish freighter Ziya Kos also ran aground in the area, but there was no further environmental damage, said Petrov. Ten ships altogether were sunk or run aground in the area of the Black Sea near the Straight of Kerch and the Straight itself; a Russian freighter carrying metal was also reported as having sunk near the port of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. One of the sulfur-carrying freighters reported three crew members as drowned, and five more as missing, while two members of the sunk freighter carrying metal were reported as drowned and another remains missing.  The oil tanker's 13 crew members were all rescued safely, and all members of the second freighter were also reported as safe. Captains had been warned Saturday morning of the stormy conditions, regional prosecutor Maxim Stepanenko told Russia's Vesti 24. The oil tanker was not built to withstand fierce storms, having been designed to transport oil on rivers during Soviet times, he said. Chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Service office of response and restoration, Jim Farr said the sulfur spill from the two freighters wouldn't create a "hazardous situation", a statement backed up by Alexei Zhukovin, expert with the Emergency Situations Ministry's branch in Southern Russia.  Although on land sulfur is used as a fungicide, in a marine setting it wouldn't act as one, said Farr; instead a sulfur spill can be compared to dumping sand on a reef and smothering it, or placing a blanket on a bed of grass. Long-term effects are more difficult to speculate on, however, without better knowledge of the area and its currents. Oleg Mitvol said that although the sulfur spill doesn't present an environmental danger, the two freighters might also leak fuel oil from their tanks, adding to the pollution.Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia, and Ukraine all border on the Black Sea.At least 21,000 gallons of crude oil has spilled into the Gulf of Mexico near the United States mainland coast, about 30 miles off the shore of Galveston, Texas. The U.S. Coast Guard says that oil is still leaking at a rate of 80 to 400 gallons a day.The High Island Pipeline began to leak on Sunday and was immediately shut down when a pressure loss was detected. The pipeline is owned by Plains All American Pipeline who state that the incident is "under investigation" and that officials are working to "minimize the impact of the incident.""A medium crude oil pipeline ruptured 30 miles southeast of Galveston, Texas, and leaked approximately 21,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico Sunday, December 24," said a press release by Coast Guard."There's a 60-yard-wide oil sheen that extends for about half a mile. It is still leaking slowly, about 80 to 400 gallons a day," added the Coast Guard.Reports say that the oil is traveling away from any shoreline and that remaining oil is being suctioned out of the pipeline. Ships in the area have not been diverted."All appropriate agencies have been notified. Plains, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Texas General Land Office are working within a unified command system consisting of Federal and state agencies and oil spill response organizations to manage and mitigate this incident. In addition, Plains has activated its spill response plan to contain and clean up the spill. At present, Plains has mobilized Airborne Support, Inc., Clean Gulf Associates and other additional resources in an effort to minimize the consequences of the incident," said a press release by the Plains oil company.So far, no injuries have been reported.In Louisiana, southeast of New Orleans, two storage tanks estimated to be filled with up to 160,000 barrels (6.7 million gallons) of oil are reported to be leaking into the Mississippi River.  It was first noticed on September 1, 2005 by an aircraft flying overhead.  Officials are not certain whether the tanks are the cause of the leak or how full the tanks are.  Inspection of the storage tanks from the ground is impossible due to flooding in the area.In comparison, the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska leaked between 11 and 35 million gallons of oil.Due to massive efforts directed toward search and rescue in New Orleans, the Coast Guard has not been able to look into the matter.Wildfires are burning homes in Oklahoma City.  Winds in excess of 40 mph have grounded helicopters and tanker planes, the high winds are also driving the fires. Firefighters have ordered an evacuation of several neighborhoods. At least three homes have burned.  200 homes have been evacuated.  The area has had only a quarter-inch of rain since October with no relief in sight.Several fires have sprung up in the region over the past few days.  Nearly 30,00 acres of prairie have burned across Texas.  Temperatures have ranged into the low 80s.Oldbury nuclear power station in South Gloucestershire, England caught fire today after overheating. No-one was injured in the blaze which is believed to have been an accident and was extuinguished within minutes by an automatic sprinkler system.The fire took place on the non-nuclear side of the plant, in an electricity transformer, but prompted shutdown of the reactor for the foreseeable future in "accordance with standard procedure," said Dan Gould, spokesman for the British Nuclear Group. He also stressed that there was no release of radiation. There were also reports of an explosion in the transformer.The BBC reported that 12 fire trucks attended the scene of the fire, but ITV stated ten crews were involved and tvnz.co.uk quoted a spokesman for Avon Fire and Rescue as saying that ten trucks were sent.Olympic rider Hawley Bennett-Awad is in hospital after being thrown from her horse during an Olympic equestrian competition today. Bennett-Awad, 35, is in a stable condition in the Royal London Hospital.The Canadian rider fell reportedly at the third fence, a fence with musical notes which may distract horses.  Bennett-Awad's horse, Gin and Juice, is said to have previously bucked its rider resulting in several hospital trips. Hawley was not the only one who fell today. Reportedly about six riders fell on the course, which is 5.7 kilometres with sharp turns and several drops.After the fall, she was eliminated from the event.A short-lived tornado with an average wind speed of 200 kilometres per hour hit Auckland's North Shore at around 3pm NZT (3am UTC), passing through the suburb of Albany and dissipating across the harbour near Point Chevalier.Among the hardest-hit buildings was the Albany Mega Centre, the local shopping mall, which had its roof torn off. Emergency services were seen tending to a man in his thirties in the car park of the shopping centre, but were unable to resuscitate him. Civil Defence originally stated there were two dead and fourteen known injuries, but later revised the death toll to one. North Shore Hospital is currently treating up to twelve casualties, including one man who has critical injuries, while others are in Waitakere and Auckland Hospitals.Trees and cars were swept up in the tornado, causing  significant damage to property and trapping residents in the vicinity. The North Western motorway was closed but has been reopened, although traffic congestion is still an issue with buses following alternative routes and trains restricted to a temporary speed limit. Auckland Council has activated their emergency coordination centre and the extent of the damage is still being assessed. Prime Minister John Key says that the New Zealand government is monitoring the situation.This tornado is the second one to hit Albany in the last twenty years, with a 1991 tornado also having a death toll of one.A man died as the result of an apartment fire in Oxfordshire, England, United Kingdom. Members of the fire service were alerted to the fire, which occurred in the town of Banbury, at approximately 1030 BST on Wednesday. The man, whose identity has not yet been determined, was rescued from the basement apartment but was later pronounced dead. No other people were injured as a result of the fire, according to Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service.Thames Valley Police and the fire service are currently performing an investigation to try and establish how the fire occurred; the area has been blocked to allow a forensic perlustration to take place. Detective Inspector Steve Duffy commented: "At this stage the death is not believed to be suspicious. Together with the fire service we are conducting enquiries into how this has happened." The police have stated that they are currently treating this death as unexplained. Inspector Helen Roberts, who is a member of Thames Valley Police, stated: "We are trying to find out the identification of the deceased male. We are speaking to family members of someone who lived there but because of the severity of the fire we are also having to do some other formal identification procedures."A person has died after being involved in a collision between a bus and a bicycle in Hampshire in the south of England, United Kingdom. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, was cycling in the seaside resort of Southsea when a number 700 Stagecoach single-decker bus, which was travelling from Brighton to Southsea, collided with her bicycle at approximately 1315 BST (1215 UTC) on Saturday. A helicopter transported the woman to Southampton General Hospital, where she died at approximately 1630 BST (1530 UTC) on the same day.None of the occupants of the bus were injured. The 53-year-old bus driver has now been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Hampshire Constabulary is requesting any witnesses to the accident to contact them. PC Phil Hunt also mentioned: "We are also trying to trace the passengers, who left the scene before we could speak to them."The road traffic accident occurred in an area where Portsmouth City Council had been intending to place a new cycle route, but the plans to do so were cancelled last week. The plans, which would have cost £250,000 (US$382,373, €296,481, A$441,126), were said to have been cancelled due to financial difficulties.Portsmouth Cycle Forum vice chair Jon Spencer has stated: "Sadly, we've had to wait less than a week for a brutal illustration of why we need this cycle route." The vice chair of the local cycling group continued: "The road at Clarence Pier is very narrow, very crowded by parked cars and very busy. It is the most popular part of the seafront but at the moment it is a no-go area for cyclists. The city council are obviously happy for this to remain the case."John Holland, the chair of the Forum, wrote on PompeyBUG, a local cycling Internet forum: "Portsmouth Cycle Forum is very sad to learn of the death in a road accident of a woman cyclist at Clarence Esplanade on Saturday 17 July. Our thoughts lie with her family and friends to whom send our deepest condolences. The cyclist was involved in collision with a bus in the vicinity of Pier Road and Clarence Esplanade, close to Clarence Pier. "This terrible accident is yet another reminder that large vehicles, busy traffic and cyclists are not a happy mix. Whilst it will be some time before the details are made public, we urge the Portsmouth City Council to press ahead with making this section of our seafront much safer and calmer for all. Almost exactly one year ago, a cyclist was seriously injured Clarence Esplanade when a car reversed blindly from a parking bay into the road. "Portsmouth City Council is on the verge of postponing Phase 2 of the Southsea Seafront Cycle Route. Had this been in place yesterday then this awful incident might have been avoided. We urge councillors to think again. A safe and segregated cycle route can be built – one which doesn’t loose any car parking, one which doesn’t stop people looking out to sea from their cars, one which doesn’t involve cycling on the promenade. We will be pushing hard for this – we don’t want any more injuries and fatalities on our seafront roads."A 55-year-old unidentified male died Saturday after his silver Peugeot motor vehicle collided with a red and white articulated truck and tanker on the A15 road.According to the Humberside Police, the road traffic accident happened on the A15 near the small village of Hibaldstow, North Lincolnshire at approximately 0739 UTC on Saturday. Although the sole occupant of the Peugeot was fatally injured, the occupant of the lorry was uninjured.A spokesperson stated: "Officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision or the vehicles prior to the collision." An investigation has begun to try to establish whether the icy and snowy weather conditions were a factor in this collision. The police have commented that it is too early to know whether the weather conditions were a factor in this crash.A passenger jet in the African country of Rwanda crashed into a VIP lounge at an airport on Thursday, officials have said, killing one person. The aircraft involved was a CRJ-100 with Rwandair, leased from the Kenyan Jetlink airline.The director general of Rwanda's Civil Aviation Authority, Richard Masozera, told media that the pilot of the aircraft reported a problem two minutes after takeoff and requested to land. The flight had been due to take its fourteen passengers to Uganda."He landed safely on the runway and was guided by the marshals into the parking area. For some unexplained reason, the plane, from the parking spot, took off again at full power and [...] took a right turn, unexplained, into the technical building," Masozera said. He added that emergency services reacted quickly to the incident, but one of the people on board the plane was hurt and died of injures.The acting chief executive of the airline, Jack Elk, suggested that the jet might have "auto-accelerated" and crashed into the building. "The captain could not control it. The plane did not get airborne again, it taxied into the building," he said, noting that the black boxes from the plane's cockpit would be analysed by the authorities. "The captain was taken to the hospital with a broken leg. He has not been able to give us any information so far."Rwandair CEO Gerald Zirimuabagabo commented that the jet had had technical difficulties in the recent past.  On Wednesday, it reportedly made an emergency landing in Nairobi, Kenya over concerns that its generator may have malfunctioned.  However, Zirimuabagabo didn't say if the technical fault was corrected by mechanics.The CEO added that an investigation into the incident was launched, and Rwandair's two remaining Jetlink-leased aircraft would be suspended, reducing the airline's fleet to only one operating jet.A man has died as the result of a collision involving a motorcycle and another car on the island of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. On Monday, at approximately 2130 BST (2030 UTC), 22-year-old Ryan Thomson, who came from Saint Martin, was riding on a motorcycle near to the location of the Mont Variouf School, located in Le Neuf Chemin, Saint Saviour. He collided with a stationary car and died as a consequence.Analysis of the incident is currently occurring. States of Guernsey Police Service would now like to discuss with any witnesses who sighted two motorcycles being driven en masse near to the location of the incident at approximately 2100 BST (2000 UTC).Members of the police force have stated that they are currently working in close cooperation with the family of Ryan Thomson; they are offering the family their sympathy.The pilot of a small plane that crahed into a warehouse near Deer Valley Airport in Phoenix, Arizona has been confirmed dead. The plane veered off the airport runway early Wednesday, shortly before landing, and then slammed into a pest-control building a quarter-mile away, bursting into flames. The cause of the crash is unknown, and no one knows how many passengers were in the plane. The small plane was a four-seat single-engine Cirrus SR 22, which is built out of a composite of plastics and fiberglass. Cindy Cross, a witness of the crash, said that "there was just a horrible black plume of smoke. We knew that it had hit a building and that it was bad because it wasn't a normal fire."The Deer Valley Airport serves general aviation and hosts an aviation school. It is unknown if the flight was a training flight or not.One man is confirmed drowned in a river as Super Typhoon Megi, also known as Juan, makes landfall in the Philippines. Megi is the strongest typhoon to strike the country this year. A change in direction sees warnings for the capital, Manila, decrease to level one – an alert indicating winds around 60 km/h (35 mph) are probable.Megi is currently a super typhoon with winds in excess of 190 km/h (120 mph). It is estimated that Megi could damage up to 60% of the rice crop in the Cagayan valley on the main island of Luzon, producer of about one-third of the rice for the country.The typhoon has brought strong winds and heavy rains to two coastal northern provinces, knocking out power and forcing the cancellation of flights. The head of the national disaster agency, Benito Ramos, states 3,000 people have been evacuated from Cagayan. Officials have also warned that extensive damage is likely. Reports state that landslides have blocked roads in the Apayao province, Luzon. The confirmed casualty was a farmer, washed away by a river.Officials are warning residents of the possibility of rough seas, flash floods and landslides. The president of the Philippines has called an emergency cabinet meeting in a military base in Manila to review disaster preparations; thousands of soldiers are on standby, ready to deliver aid to those affected.At least one person is seriously wounded and one dead after a 17 year-old male opened fire and shot his ex-girlfriend, Jessica Forsyth, 17, four times outside the Herbert Henry Dow High School located in Midland, Michigan before turning the gun on himself. The shooter was pronounced dead on the scene and according to Midland Police Chief, James St. Louis, the shooter died in the parking lot of the school while the girl is in a local hospital. She is said to be in stable but serious condition at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan.Chief St. Louis says that the boy pulled out a gun and began to shoot the girl after the two had a conversation. He then shot himself. St. Louis also said that the mother of the girl, who had dropped her daughter off at school for the day, tried to stop the incident from happening by driving her car in between the girl and boy, but was not successful. The boy, whose name is not known, apparently had stored the gun inside his backpack.According to Midland Deputy Chief, Bob Lane, the boy was not a student at the school and was not granted access into the school. Lane also stated that the boy then placed a phone call to Forsyth telling her to meet him outside the school just before 11:00 a.m. [EST].The school hosts nearly 1,500 students. The school was in lockdown, but according to a statement on the school's website, the lockdown was cancelled."This morning a shooting incident took place at Dow High outside the building near the cafeteria. A Code Red lock-down was issued, but has been lifted," said the statement.At 12:50 pm on January 3, a ski chairlift ride cost a German skier's life and another German woman was left with serious injuries after the lift cable derailed from the mast sheaves in a windstorm. The derailed chairlift is the two-seater Fallboden lift at Kleine Scheidegg, next to the Jungfrau mountain in Switzerland. Two more Australian tourists were lightly injured. About 20 further people had to be evacuated from the stopped chairlift. Wind velocity peaking at 90km/h prevented a helicopter from rescuing the trapped passengers, complicating the rescue. According to 20min.ch, the lift was manufactured by Garaventa AG, a major Swiss ski lift company, now a part of an international group Doppelmayr/Garaventa. When contacted no one was available for comment.Shortly before the accident, a wind alarm was activated few times by a 60km/h wind. The operator decided to close the lift and waited for the lift to unload all passengers; at the moment of the catastrophe the bottom station of the lift was already closed, but 75 passengers were still on the lift.According to the Swiss law, every chair lift must be designed to withstand a lateral wind load of 250 newtons (approx. 25kg) per square meter. However there is no law limit at which wind speed or lateral loads the chair lifts have to be stopped. This safety aspect is left to the responsibility of the operator. The safety of the lift was checked by the Swiss Federal Office of Transport in January 2006. This chairlift accident is said to be the worst in Switzerland for the last 8 years.One person is dead and 18 others injured after lightning struck a church group's Fourth of July celebration in Lakeland, Florida, United States yesterday. The group were outside playing soccer and volleyball when either a single bolt or a series of them hit. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said, "It's very sad to see folks just celebrating the Fourth, in a way that you would hope people would celebrate the Fourth, with friends and family, and a lightning strike, an act of God occurred, and one person died". 19 people were transported to hospitals; one was later pronounced dead. Despite some clouds in the area, the lightning reportedly caught many off guard. Judd noted, "This is Florida. There's build up every afternoon." No buildings or structures sustained damage, so it is unclear exactly where the bolt struck. The church members were described as "exceptionally composed considering the tragedy."On average, there are 1.5 million lightning strikes per year in the state, causing more fatalities than hurricanes, tornadoes, and other meteorological hazards.A man has died and another man and a woman are injured after a road traffic accident in Somerset, England, United Kingdom. At approximately 02:00 British Summer Time (01:00 UTC) yesterday, a BMW 328 that was carrying the three along the A370 road in East Brent — close to the location of Burnham-on-Sea — struck a telegraph pole before becoming stationary in a hedge and subsequently caught fire.The 19-year-old male driver died at the location of this one-vehicle collision. The male passenger and female passenger, both of which were also teenage, were transported to Weston General Hospital. The road — which electricity cables had fallen onto — was closed down for approximately nine hours, with the fire service and police present.It is thought that the A-road has now been re-opened. The police have commenced an investigation to attempt to establish the chain of events.The January 8 submarine accident has left one sailor dead, the U.S. Navy has said.

Spokesman Kaloi Akhiltov said to the Associated Press news agency that a van packed with explosive material drove into the traffic checkpoint. The checkpoint post was completely destroyed, he said.According to government-controlled RIA news agency, the single casualty from the blast was a civilian.The attack has been blamed by regional authorities on Islamist separatist rebels.The Caucasus region of Russia has seen an increase in attacks recently, following a few years of relative calm after two wars with separatists in the neigbouring region of Chechnya.A French truck driver was killed and 34 rail passengers injured on Tuesday when a TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse) train impacted a lorry in Eastern France near Switzerland, according to officials.The TGV, which was travelling from Paris to Geneva, rammed into the truck which had become stuck on a level crossing, at around 9:30 a.m. CET (UTC+1) near the eastern town of Tossiat. The lorry driver died on the scene and the train driver was seriously injured in the crash. Officials have said that the accident involved a lorry that was carrying a cement mixing unit and that it had become stuck on the level crossing for an unknown reason, and was trapped in by the barriers when they went down. However, police officials have said that the driver had managed to leave the cabin of his truck, and that he was most likely moving to leave the level crossing by foot when the train impacted.Travelling at around 100 kilometres (65 miles) per hour, the TGV was derailed, causing the SNCF (the French National Rail Service) to deviate all trains on the Paris–Geneva service via Lyon for the next 48 hours.  The train's remaining 160 passengers were safely evacuated.One person has been killed and dozens of boats have been severely damaged or sunk by storms on the Spanish island of Majorca.The storms hit the island frequently last week, and the weather finally calmed on Sunday.In San Telmo, a 62-year-old man died when he tried to save his sinking yacht. Winds of up to 60 mph were reported with gusts reaching 75 mph.Boats could be seen sinking into the water for several days after the storm, with people unable to rescue them due to the conditions.Local residents stated that they were the worst to hit the island, which has a large number of ports, in ten years, with the clean up effort continuing into this week.One person has been killed and another person has been seriously injured as the result of a road traffic accident in Worcestershire, England. The vehicle, a Vauxhall Astra, had two occupents. One of them was a man who was believed to have been aged around 20. The other occupant of the vehicle was an 18-year-old woman. Currently, neither of them have been publically identified.The vehicle collided with a tree on the A4023 road in Redditch at around 2200 GMT on Sunday; West Mercia Police were subsequently called to the scene of the accident. The driver suffered from serious injuries and was later pronounced dead at the scene of the collision.The passenger had to be taken to the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch. She suffered from leg and arm injuries, as well as a serious injury to her head. Inside the hospital, her condition has been considered as serious, although her injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.One person was killed and two were injured when a small plane crashed into a residential tower shortly after taking off from Vancouver International Airport.  The twin engine Piper Seneca hit the ninth floor of the 15-storey building in Richmond, where the airport is located, but it did not cause a fire.The male pilot of the plane was killed, while two people in the building were hurt -- one seriously, the other suffering minor injuries.The plane appears to have hit the building at an angle, with damage spread between the eighth and ninth floors.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash.At least one fisherman has died and 134 others were rescued on Lake Erie off the shores of Ohio after an eight mile wide piece of ice broke off the frozen lake's ice shelf and began to drift. The United States Coast Guard says the unidentified man who died fell into the water while trying to find a way off the ice. Rescuers were able to get him out of the water, but he died while being flown to a nearby hospital for treatment.The Coast Guard also said that the fishermen were warned that the ice could break, but many didn't believe there was any danger."We were in no danger.  We knew there was enough ice out there," said Swanton, Ohio resident Norb Pilaczynski, one of those rescued from the ice.  Before heading onto the already broken ice, they made a makeshift bridge from wooden pallets to get to and from the shore, but the ice shifted and the bridge was destroyed.  It left all 135 people stranded more than 1,000 yards from the shoreline.The ice in most parts of the lake can be up to two feet thick, but on Saturday temperatures rose above freezing, with winds of over 35 miles per hour. The combination of both high winds and temperatures, broke the thick ice into dozens of large pieces.Ottawa County sheriff Bob Bratton called those who avoided the warnings "idiotic"."What happened here today was just idiotic. I don't know how else to put it," stated Bratton. The rescue operation took nearly five hours to complete. Lake Erie is the fourth largest lake of the five Great Lakes in the U.S., but the smallest by volume, and the tenth largest fresh water lake in the world. Several helicopters were called in from Detroit, Michigan and Traverse City. A C-130 was also used to survey the lake which was flown in from Elizabeth City, North Carolina.An Indonesian government volcanologist reports that Mount Merapi spewed lava and ash many times on Saturday, renewing fears of a devastating volcanic eruption.Government geologist Subandriyo said that Merapi's lava dome has swelled 56 feet (17 m) in the past week to a height of 330 feet (100 m), raising fears that it could collapse and release a pyroclastic flow of hot gases and rock fragments burning everything in its path.  The quake is believed to contribute to the growing instability of the lava dome, scientists said.The mountain also sent about 90 trails of molten lava down its western slope on Thursday, said geologist Tri Yani.The announcement comes one week after a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Yogyakarta, killing at least 6,000 people and injuring tens of thousands more.  Since then, the region has experienced over one thousand aftershocks - most were weak, but some were strong enough to jolt villagers awake in the area.Villagers in the vicinity of the mountain have started performing ancient religious rituals aimed at averting an eruption.  The royally appointed guardian of the mountain, "Mbah" Maridjan, was reported to have led a silent procession of about 100 people on a march around a village near the volcano.Almost exactly one year ago, on March 7, Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 crashed during landing at Adisucipto International Airport, near Yogyakarta, after a scheduled domestic Indonesian passenger flight. 21 people - 16 Indonesians and five Australians - were killed when the Boeing 737-400 overshot the runway, crossed a road, struck an embankment and burst into flames in a rice paddy. Overall, the plane had traveled 252m beyond the extreme end of the runway.The final report, released in October, blamed pilot error for the disaster. The report stated that the aircraft had approached at a speed far exceeding that at which the wing flaps could properly operate, and attempted to execute a landing at 408 kph (254 mph), which is 160 kph (100 mph) above the safe speed. It also found that captain Marwoto Komar had ignored fifteen activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) informing Mr Komar that the aircraft was flying at a speed beyond that at which it could safely land, but he failed to abort.It also commented that he missed one further opportunity for emergency evasive action when the airliner struck the runway and bounced into the air, at which point co-pilot Gagam Rochmana requested a 'go-around' procedure be initiated, but was also ignored. It further criticised Mr Komar for singing during final approach, a direct violation of the Garuda Basic Operations Manual, which calls for activation of the Sterile Cockpit Rule at 10,000 feet and below.Mr Rochmana was also criticised for his failure to take control away from Mr Komar when it became apparent that the aircraft was being operated in an unsafe manner. However, the report did note that Garuda Indonesia had failed to give him any simulator training replicating a situation whereby the co-pilot would take over control duties from the pilot in charge due to unsafe handling of the plane; in fact, training was found to be inadequate for both members of the cockpit crew.Further criticisms were also leveled at airport and governmental authorities for failures in their respective roles to provide safety features and to enforce regulations.However, the Indonesian authorities have recently generated intense controversy by deciding to prosecute Mr Komar for his role in the disaster. The move has been pushed for by some, but met with opposition by others.Alexander Downer, Australian foreign minister at the time of the crash, immediately said "...I am very glad that they have reached a point now where they have charged the captain of the aircraft." The unusually high number of Australians amongst the 140 passengers on board was attributable to a visit by Mr Downer. One of those was Morgan Mellish of the Australian Financial Review, who died in the crash. His sister, Caroline Mellish, had specifically called for prosecution to be avoided, saying "I think having 21 deaths on your conscience is probably enough. I don't think prosecuting the man is going to make any difference."There were fierce calls for prosecution of both pilots immediately after the report's release, with Downer himself pressuring the Indonesian authorities, citing the "very credible report" and saying "I've asked our ambassador today (October 24) to make it absolutely clear to the Indonesians that we want people prosecuted for this accident. I want to see people who have negligently allowed Australians … to be killed, I want to see those people brought to justice."Australian Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd also made clear a desire for prosecutions, saying he had telephoned secretary-general of Indonesia's foreign affairs department and former ambassador to Australia Imron Cotan, telling him that he wanted those responsible "prosecuted to the absolute full". "This is a serious matter, many Australians visit Indonesia, Garuda is an often used airline and there is a basic national interest at stake here as well," he said.National Transport Safety Committee chairman Tatang Kurniadi said at the time that no information from the report could be used in any criminal or civil liability investigations. "I would like to go back to the objective of this, the report was made by NTSC for safety purposes only, not for blaming, he said. "If any institution wants to ... follow up that accident, that's their own decision. The report contained the results from the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, but according to international regulations on aviation these black boxes are not allowed to be used for... liability purposes. We will not give police or any institution (information) other than for safety purposes only - it's in international regulations and we want to follow those regulations." He also confirmed that investigators cannot speak to the police, with the only permitted testimony under the legislation being to testify at a court hearing, and pointed out that the document does not actually appoint any blame.The international legislation he was referring to is probably the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which stipulates that accident reports and related material, specifically transcripts of interviews, communications with crew and cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder (collectively known as black boxes) readouts, must not be used for any purpose other than determining the cause of an accident or incident. The only possible exception to this is where potential benefit would outweigh the "adverse domestic and international impact" on the investigation in question or any other either in progress or in the future. This legislation is in place to provide protection to witnesses on the basis that without it they may be less likely to cooperate with investigational procedures.The law caused was actively opposed by some. Aridono Sukman, the police member in charge of the criminal investigation, said that the contents of the black box were vital evidence. Officials commented that some relatives had expressed their frustration over the legal challenges involved in the prosecution effort.Early in February Mr Komar was arrested; he has subsequently been charged with manslaughter charges which carry a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. The London-based International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA) issued a press release condemning this move, saying that further investigations are needed into the crash, and that criminal proceedings could prevent an accurate version of events from ever being known. Specifically, the release said that "IFALPA believes that the circumstances of the accident as set forth in the final report of the Indonesian investigation authority leaves many serious questions concerning the crew actions prior to the accident. Central to these concerns are the underlying reasons for the reported behavior of Captain Marwoto Komar. Experienced pilots have considerable difficulty in attempting to explain what is reported in the context of normal airline operations. The Federation believes that the explanations proffered by the report do not square with the collective experience of our members." The release went on to state the opinion that prosecution may bring total foreclosure to the case and could only be counterproductive. It also said "He remains a professional who was involved in an unfortunate tragedy."One possible explanation had previously been suggested by the head of the Garuda pilots association, Stephanus Geraldus. He said that marital problems between Mr Komar and his wife Norma Andriani were "common knowledge" and was backed up by an industry analyst and pilot who said he believed the couple had been arguing late into the night, and expressed concern that the report had not addressed psychological issues. Mr Geraldus also said sleep deprivation could have contributed, with the flight crew reporting for duty at 4:30 am and the flight departing an hour and a half later.The report had hinted at problems, saying The pilot was probably emotionally aroused because his conscious awareness moved from the relaxed mode “singing” to the heightened stressfulness of the desire to reach the runway by making an excessively steep and fast, unstabilised approach,” and "His attention was fixated or channelised on landing the aircraft on the runway and he either did not hear, or disregarded the GPWS alerts, and warnings, and calls from the copilot to go around." It is also known that Mr Komar had been under police surveillance, during which time he was receiving psychological treatment. The Indonesian Pilot's Association has also said that the criminal prosecution should be avoided, arguing that the only people who can judge whether mistakes were made in aviation are those professionally involved and not the police. There were protests in Jakarta demanding his release and dozens of pilots across the nation also campaigned. Meanwhile, two survivors, Adrianus Meliala and Retno Gunowati, went to the House of Representatives (DPR) to challenge those opposed to legal processes against the pilot.Mr Komar was released on police bail on February 15, and is currently awaiting trial. He was forced to resign late in February with being fired his only alternative, and his licence has been suspended. He is believed to be the only man ever prosecuted in Indonesian history over an airliner crash.The issues thrown up by this ongoing case have now been exclusively commented on for Wikinews by Paul McCarthy. Mr McCarthy is IFALPA's representative to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). He is both a pilot - as are all of IFALPA's roughly 100,000 members - and a lawyer, and is an acknowledged expert on issues concerning the criminal liability of pilots. Mr McCarthy's comments, obtained by email via IFALPA media representative Gideon Ewers are available below.Thai low-cost air carrier One-Two-Go Airlines has announced that it will be grounding all 16 of its aircraft immediately until September 15. The news comes as legal action against the airline and associated companies begins over the September crash of Flight 269, which killed 90 people, mostly foreigners.Udom Tantiprasongchai, founder of the airline, has said conditions were hard for airlines with fuel prices having doubled within a year. He says 70% of operating costs are taken up with fuel, and the airline has already raised fuel surcharges again by 100 baht to 850 baht per leg."In this kind of environment, anyone can go (bankrupt) anytime," said Urdom, who declined to comment on the impact the present financial situation has had on his airline, saying only that they "are financially sustainable." He also said that the airline could return to service with ease if prices dropped, noting that, "if the situation improved with fuel prices being lowered and the profitability outlook was better, we could be airborne again."The airline began operations in 2003; it is a subsidiary of Orient Thai Airlines. Orient Thai, which will continue to operate as normal, recently opened Thailand's first freight-only airline, Orient Thai Cargo, with a pair of Boeing 747-200Fs bought from Japan Airlines.Urdon said that a major part of the problem is that eight of the company's aircraft are MD-11s, which consume large volumes of fuel. He also said that a collapse of a damage limitation scheme with rivals Nok Airlines and Thai AirAsia had affected his decision. Both rival carriers were also struggling financially. One-Two-Go has already cut many routes.The news comes as the first families of victims of Flight OG269 launch legal action against the airline, as well as parent airline Orient Thai and lessor Grandmax Group. Already confirmed to be involved in the action are Richard and Margaret Collins as well as Steve and Jean Jones, parents of Alex Collins, 22, and Bethan Jones, also 22, an unmarried Welsh couple who, a few days into a round-the-world trip, were among the 123 passengers on board. Alex was reported missing but quickly confirmed to have died, while Bethan died ten days after the accident with her family at her bedside, bringing the final death toll to 90."We believe the air crash was completely avoidable and those responsible should be held to account. While we accept that nothing can bring Alex and Bethan and the other people who lost their lives back, we are keen to make sure we prevent this from happening again," said the families in a joint statement. "We will be forcing One-Two-Go Airlines to prove in court that they are not a low cost, low safety airline," said James Healy-Pratt, head of aviation at Stewarts Law in London. He also said that the action will be brought before courts in the United States.The Northern Constabulary says two women have been killed in a road traffic accident on Orkney, Scotland. A third person was seriously injuried.Three vehicles were involved in the incident near the town of Kirkwall at approximately 2145 UTC yesterday. The Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service had to release three people from the wreckage, two were already dead. A third person freed by the rescue workers survived the accident with serious injuries and was transported to Balfour Hospital in Kirkwall.In a statement, the Northern Constabulary confirmed the road on which the accident occurred "will be closed until further notice, with local diversions in place while police carry out investigation into the circumstances". No further details about those involved in the incident have been publicly divulged thus far. The force has encouraged any potential witnesses to contact them.Early this morning, Ostankino Tower in Moscow, Russia, caught fire for the second time since August 2000, due to sparks from welding work on a balcony which set fire to insulation. BBC News Online reported that the fire is not currently considered to have been as serious as the fire seven years ago that killed three and left homes without television for many days. Everyone present in the tower at the time was successfully evacuated. The fire was first isolated to a platform on the outside of the tower and later successfully extinguished, with no casualties or disruptions to any television signals around Moscow.A man, reportedly a postman, has died as the result of a one-vehicle road traffic collision in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. Emergency services were alerted to the incident, which occurred on Ford Terrace on the island of Benbecula, at 1139 UTC yesterday.STV News reported the mail carrier, who has not yet been publicly identified, was conducting his duties at the time of the incident. According to Hebrides News, the accident occurred when the man was standing outside of the van he was driving; the vehicle rolled over the man, fatally injuring him.The Northern Constabulary said the local Road Policing Unit based in the town of Dingwall in the Scottish Highlands has launched an investigation into the incident. A spokesperson for the Royal Mail said the postal service is cooperating with police as they investigate the incident. "Our thoughts are with the postman's family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time", the spokesperson added.Police do not intend to disclose any further information about the incident until relatives of the deceased have been informed of the incident. No other vehicles are thought to have been involved; the Northern Constabulary has not yet said if it is looking for any other persons in relation to the fatality.At least 113 people are now dead and hundreds more are missing after a 10 foot (3 m) tsunami destroyed several villages in a series of remote islands in western Indonesia. The tsunami was caused by a magnitude 7.7 earthquake which struck on Monday at 9:42 p.m. local time (14:42 UTC). The epicenter of the earthquake was 78 kilometers (48 mi) west of South Pagai, one of the Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra. “We are predicting that people will need food supplies and shelter. The rain is coming down very hard, the wind is very strong,” a local police officer said, addind that emergency posts had been set up and patrols were being made to try and locate the missing. An official said that they had purchased 200 body bags "just in case."A local official said that most of the buildings in the coastal village of Betu Monga had been destroyed when the tsunami struck. “Of the 200 people living in that village, only 40 have been found. 160 are still missing, mostly women and children,” he said. “We have people reporting to the security post here that they could not hold on to their children, that they were swept away. A lot of people are crying.” Food supplies, he added, were running low. Wisnu Wijaya, the preparedness director with the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the government is getting aid to the islands. "We already sent a rapid response team to this area, coordinated by the provincial government. We have local disaster management at Padang, because right now the condition of the wave is quite high," he said. Wijaya added that high waves and stormy weather have made it difficult to reach the affected areas, and communication was a problem. Emergency shelters have been set up and the first team from Sumatra was arriving Tuesday evening to begin a rapid assessment of the aid that was needed. "Up to now, I think we still can manage this problem. Maybe also we'll send staff to go there and make a better coordination. If they need national resources to deploy there, we'll be ready to support local government," Wijaya said.The head of the regional government in the affected area told local television that some of the people recorded as missing may have moved to higher ground to take refuge from the waves. Rick Hallet, who was aboard his boat when the earthquake struck, told Australian television: "We threw whatever we could that floated—surfboards, fenders—then we jumped into the water. Fortunately, most of us had something to hold on to ... and we just washed in the wetlands, and scrambled up the highest trees that we could possibly find and sat up there for an hour and a half." The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a statement saying that radio contact had been lost with a tourist boat in the area which could have been nine Australians and a Japanese national. A humanitarian organisation said that there were "genuine fears" for those aboard. A spokesperson for a surfing resort on the coast of North Pagai said that they had “experienced a level of devastation that has rendered the resort inoperable”. Witnesses suggested that villas at the resort had been “wiped out” by the tsunami. One report suggested that a 10 feet (3 m) wave had hit the resort, causing boats to burst into flames. “There was a lot of debris floating in the water, including bar stools and other pieces of furniture from Macaronis Resort,” a member of staff said. Reports suggested that water had reached rooftops in North Pagai.Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area prone to seismic shifts that spark earthquakes and volcanic activity. A massive earthquake in 2004 caused a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people across the Indian Ocean. After that disaster Indonesia worked to establish early warning systems and disaster management programs to help deal with future quakes.An Afriqiyah Airways-owned aeroplane, originating from South Africa, has crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport in Libya at around 06:00 Eastern European time (0400 UTC). Initial reports indicated everyone on board died, which officials say is 93 passengers and 11 crew, but later developments say an eight-year-old boy was the sole survivor; however, this is unconfirmed.The plane left Johannesburg in South Africa with the aim of transferring at Tripoli before heading to the final destination, United Kingdom's London Gatwick Airport. Officials have ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash, which is still undetermined.  A security official said the plane "exploded on landing and totally disintegrated."In a statement, Afriqiyah Airways said, "We extend our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of the victims[;] the search and rescue mission has now been completed."The crew on the plane were all of Libyan nationality, officials claim, while the passengers included Libyans, South Africans, Dutch and Britons. In response to reports of British citizens being on board the crashed plane, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said, "We are urgently investigating. A consular team from the British Embassy are on their way to the airport. Consular staff in Tripoli are urgently seeking further details."Over 100 people died in a massive stampede at the Chamunda Devi temple Jodhpur, in the western state of Rajasthan, India. 168 people were killed, with just as many injured. A temple wall collapsed, causing panic among ten of thousands of gathered Hindu worshippers who then began to run for safety, causing the stampede. Several are still believed to be trapped under the rubble. According to  Malini Agarwal, a Jodhpur police officer, over 10,000 Hindus had gathered at a temple to perform their religious rites. Most of the injured have been transported to the nearest hospital and appeals were being made for the remaining pilgrims to be calm and peaceful.In August another deadly incident resulting from a stampede occurred in the second day of a nine-day religious festival at the Naina Devi Temple in Himachal Pradesh state; more than 130 people were killed due to panic in Northern India.Another incident in January 2005 saw more then 250 Hindu worshippers killed in a stampede near a remote temple in the state of Maharashtra.The recent wildfires in Santa Barbara County, California, have burned more than 1,300 acres (2.03-square mile) of land between Tuesday and Thursday. Over 20 homes were destroyed, 5,400 homes abandoned and more than 13,500 residents were evacuated. Of the 1,400 firefighters tending the blaze, ten firefighters have been injured, three seriously. "There maybe should have been hundreds of homes lost due to the amount of fuel in that canyon and the 70 mph winds," Santa Barbara County Fire Chief Tom Franklin said. "There was some real effort made on that fire front and some real saves that the firefighters made out there.""Sundowner winds really pick up after sundown and they can just wreak havoc," said a spokeswoman for the Santa Barbara County emergency operations center. Near Sierra Vista, Arizona, another fire has taken three homes, critically injured one person and destroyed 4,000 acres.  It is 30% under control.Santa Barbara has just recovered from the Montecito Tea Fire, which took 210 homes in the fall of 2008.  2008 also saw the Sayre Fire, Chino Hills and the Triangle Complex Fire in California.Rescue efforts are underway to free more than 200 skiers trapped Tuesday at Maine's Sugarloaf ski resort, which is located 120 miles north of Portland. Several injuries were reported after a ski lift broke down; an employee at the resort said this caused several people to fall to the ground. The Spillway East lift reportedly came to a halt during high winds due to a derailment. Around 10:30 a.m. ET, a cable slid over one tower's pulley leading to five chairs falling about 30 feet.Ethan Austin, a resort spokesperson, revealed that several individuals were taken to near-by hospitals with non-life-threatening conditions.  At the time, winds originating from this month's blizzard were blowing up to 43 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. Austin confirmed Tuesday afternoon that the lift was carrying around 220 people at the time of the breakdown.Efforts to remove trapped skiers are in progress Tuesday afternoon.At least 259 people are dead and over 3000 people have been infected in the Haitian cholera outbreak. Officials from the United Nations have said that they fear that the disease will spread across the entire country. As the cholera spreads quickly across the country anxiety levels are high as fears mount that the disease will spread to the earthquake ravaged city of Port-au-Prince. However, so far only a few cases have been reported in the capital which occurred when five people from the Artibonite region traveled to the capital where the disease became symptomatic.A field hospital has been setup in Saint-Marc to help treat patients while Oxfam has sent specialists to set up sanitation, hygiene and water facilities. The Health minister, Alex Larsen, and the president, Rene Preval, toured the affected areas and Larsen revealed that the government was launching a large anti-cholera campaign, aided by the WHO and US health officials. The UN has set up cholera treatment facilities in the Artibonite region and sent additional doctors. Facilities were also set up in the capital. It is believed that the massive surge of deaths will soon subside, but there will be more cases in the future due to the disease being established in the atmosphere. According to the CDC cholera is "an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae." The CDC also says, "the infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 20 (5%) infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours." Cholera is contracted from drinking water or eating food contaminated by the Vibrio cholerae bacteria.More than 30 people have been killed and 140 people injured when a truck carrying dynamite exploded in Mexico shortly after being involved in a road traffic accident near Sacramento, Coahuila.The lorry collided with another vehicle on a busy Northern Mexico highway, and the wreckage quickly drew a large crowd of onlookers. Shortly after the spectators arrived, the vehicles burst into flames, causing the dynamite to explode, engulfing nearby cars.The explosives had originally been intended for delivery in Coquimatlan, Colima, for use in coal mining. The truck had just left an Orica explosives facility where the dynamite had been manufactured.The explosion left a crater ten feet by 40 feet, and was powerful enough to blast out the windows of a passenger bus a quarter of a mile away. There are conflicting reports of death and injury counts, with the Associated Press giving the toll as 34 dead and 150 injured, and BBC News Online as 37 dead and 'dozens' injured.Most of those injured were onlookers and emergency response personnel. The scene was attended by police, the military and other emergency services workers.The fate of the driver is unclear, but some unconfirmed early reports say he fled the scene of the accident. The death toll is believed to include three local reporters who were covering the crash.Over 60 miners  were killed in an abandoned gold mine shaft near Welkom, in the Free State province of South Africa, after a fire broke out inside the mine.36 bodies from the Harmony Gold mining company Eland mine shaft were brought up earlier on the weekend from depths up to 1.4 kilometers (1 mi). On Tuesday, 25 more bodies were recovered by other illegal workers."We suspect there was a fire on the 18th of May. We never saw any smoke. Over the weekend [30 May] we were informed by other illegal miners that people had died," said Tom Smith, Chief Operating Officer for Harmony's South Region, "The bodies are not burnt. It seems more of a case of gas or smoke inhalation. I don't know if there are any more bodies down there, we just have to wait." The workers may have died from poisonous gasses, smoke inhalation, suffocation, cave-ins or carbon monoxide poisoning.Harmony gold mine will not send anyone in to the mine as the conditions are extremely dangerous and abandoned shafts are without safety equipment. Illegal workers may gain access bypassing security at one mine site, and exit via a series of interconnected underground tunnels many miles away.Harmony is internationally the fifth largest gold mining company and has bought up old, abandoned mines. Police were seeking relatives to help identify the bodies, and are instigating an investigation into the circumstances. Almost 300 "gold pirates" were arrested over the past two weeks at the Eland mine shaft alone. Thousands of illegal workers can be underground, and remain working for weeks and months continuously. "These are ex-miners and unemployed people - we need to target the syndicates," said Smith.There are over 4.18 million unemployed in South Africa due to the economic decline, and another 1 million may soon join the ranks. Susan Shabangu, the minister of mining, extended her condolences.Welkom, with a population of over 400,000 is located 160 kilometers (99 mi) northeast of Bloemfontein, the provincial capital.It is feared that over 700 people have died after a ferry in the Philippines capsized after being hit by Typhoon Fengshen. So far, 38 people from the ferry have been found alive. Some people were washed onto the shore. One of the survivors, Reynato Lanoria, a janitor on the ferry, said that about 100 people jumped into the ocean.     The ferry left Manila en route to Cebu on Friday, and according to the owners, Sulpicio Lines, contact was lost at about 12:30 local time Saturday.A rescue ship was sent to rescue the survivors, although this only happened 24 hours after contact was lost with the boat.One of the survivors described the incident. "There were many of us who jumped overboard, but we were separated because of the big waves," he said.He continued, "The others were also able to board the life rafts, but it was useless because the strong winds flipped them over."Indonesian officials have said that at least 770 people have been killed and thousands more feared trapped under collapsed buildings, following a powerful earthquake on Wednesday. The 7.6-magnitude quake struck off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, and officials are trying to determine the extent of the damage. A second earthquake hit the region at 01.52 UTC on Thursday, measuring at a magnitude of 6.8, with the epicentre about 150 miles southeast of the first quake.The death toll is expected to rise as rescue workers dig through the rubble, and the Indonesian health ministry said it believes that the death toll could go into the thousands. Hundreds of people are believed seriously injured. As of 13.00 UTC, a disaster ministry official said that the official death toll was at 770, with 290 people being heavily wounded and a further 2,090 receiving light injuries.However, prime minister Jusuf Kalla said that the true death toll was "definitely higher" than the current statistics, due to difficulties recovering bodies. "It's hard to tell because there is heavy rain and a blackout," Kalla said.Most of the deaths have been reported in the Sumatra city of Padang, where at least 500 buildings were toppled by the quake. A hospital, hotel, and school facilities were among the buildings destroyed in Padang, a coastal city of 900,000.Padang's mayor, Fauzi Bahar, asked for help on Indonesian radio. "We really need help. We call on people to come to Padang to evacuate bodies and help the injured," he said, saying that his city was "overwhelmed" by the earthquake.Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the country's president, visited some of the areas most affected by the disaster. "I ask rescue workers to continue working in teams with clear goals to keep looking for survivors" he said. "[...] This is a natural disaster, so let us remain strong in dealing with it." Titi Moektijasih from the United Nations Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that the current disaster recovery efforts were not sufficient. "Compared to the extent of the damage, you see there should be more equipment, more people to do this," she told the AFP news agency.The Red Cross' head of operations in Indonesia, Bob McKerrow, told the BBC news agency that it was difficult to dispatch personnel to affected areas due to poor infrastructure. "it's just such a vast area to be working in with such bad infrastructure," he said. "[...] The roads and bridges have all been damaged, so [there is] a challenge ahead of us." McKerrow said that 400 personnel, among them fifty doctors, had arrived in Indonesia by airplane on Thursday.Indonesian health minister Siti Fadilah Supari said that a mall and two hospitals in Padang were destroyed by the tremors. "This is a high-scale disaster, more powerful than the earthquake in Yogyakarta in 2006 when more than 3,000 people died," he said.Indonesia's government has sent medical teams and military planes to help with relief efforts, and announced $10 million in emergency aid. The British Red Cross started a fundraiser to help people affected by the earthquake.The earthquakes were the latest in a string of natural and man-made disasters to hit the sprawling archipelago of 226 million people.Indonesia is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake along the same fault line caused a massive tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in a dozen countries.Scientists had warned that a severe earthquake might strike the area for some time, however, Indonesia did not have sufficient funds to pay for disaster preparation measures, the Al Jazeera news agency reported.New figures show an estimated 917 have died and 14,000 more infected with cholera in Haiti's present outbreak. However, it is suspected that many deaths in mountainous regions far from hospitals are going unreported.  Clinics are rapidly filling up and many deaths are being reported. "The trend is extremely, extremely alarming. We have not reached a peak yet, but it could arrive next week," said the head of mission for Medecins Sans Frontieres, Stefano Zannini. A health official described the situation in Port-Au-Prince as "[growing] more pathetic each day." The official also said that hospitals in the capital are not able to cope with all of the patients. The United Nations has appealed to donor nations for US$164 million in order to import more doctors, medicine, and water purification systems. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) "experience from the Peru outbreak in the early 1990s and from other countries in Latin America suggests that we should expect to identify additional cases for many months to several years." CDC says cholera is "an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but sometimes it can be severe... In severe cases, the infected person may experience profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours."At least 20 people have been injured and one has been killed in a bomb blast targeting 'Western tourists' in Cairo, Egypt. The Egyptian Health Ministry reported that a 17-year-old French girl was killed and 13 French, one German and three Saudis tourists, as well as four Egyptians, have been wounded.The blast occurred at approximately 6:20 p.m. local time inside a cafe near a mosque in the Khan el-Khalili marketplace which is popular with foreign tourists. Authorities say the bomb was placed under a bench. A second bomb was found, but was defused before it exploded.Egyptian medical officials said they expect several of the injured to be released from hospital treatment on Monday.The bombing has caused concern for Cairo authorities, who saw the tourist industry devastated by bombings and shootings by Islamic militants in the 1990s.The same marketplace was the target of a previous suicide attack in 2005 in which three people were killed and 18 injured. The Khan el-Khalili marketplace is one of Cairo's biggest tourist attractions and has a history dating back to 1382.At least 15 people have been killed and over 50 more injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up inside a mosque in the Iranian city of Zahedan in the province of Baluchestan. The Iranian news agency Fars reports the death toll to be at 20 and 55 injured."The bomb exploded at the time of evening prayer and killed a number of worshippers," said the governor general of Baluchestan Province, Ali Mohammad Azad.Reports also say that a second device, a bomb, was found inside the mosque when rescue workers were searching for victims, but that authorities were able to defuse it. No group has claimed responsibility though authorities blame militants from Western nations. It was earlier thought that the blast had been due to live ammunition in a 1980's war exhibit being mishandled.The last time an Iranian mosque was the target of a suicide bombing was in April 2008. A bomber blew himself up inside a mosque in Shiraz, injuring over 200 people and killing 13.File:Columnas de humo del accidente aéreo de Madrid-Barajas (2008).jpgA passenger plane leaving from Madrid - Barajas Airport has crashed during take-off. 153 fatalities and 19 injuries have been reported amongst those who were on the aircraft. Flight JK5022, operated by Spanair, was destined for Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, when it skidded off the end of the runway in good weather at 14:45 local time. An engine of the aircraft is reported to have caught fire during the attempted takeoff. A spokesman for S.A.M.U.R. stated that there were only 26 survivors. The plane at the time was carrying 173 people. 7 survivors later died en route to hospital.The cause is unknown, but reports indicate that the left engine of the MD-82 was on fire during take-off. The United States agency National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to help with the investigation and reported that "the aircraft broke apart and a post-crash fire ensued." "Helicopters are continually heading to the scene, dropping lots of water... The smoke has really died down now, things seem to be more under control," said Stephanie McGovern from the BBC, commenting on the incident. Manuel Moleno, who witnessed the crash, said that "I've seen around 50 ambulances. They're still coming and going, so there may still be more casualties.""SAS is doing everything possible to help passengers and next-of-kin and to assist Spanish authorities at this difficult time," read a statement from SAS Group, the Stockholm-based company that owns Spanair. "SAS will provide further information as soon as it becomes available.""Boeing sends its deep condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the crash of Spanair flight 5022, and its wishes for the quick recovery of the injured," said manufacturer Boeing which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997. "We stand ready to provide technical assistance."Two and a half million people have been displaced and over 250 people were killed following the heaviest flooding to hit southern India in a hundred years.Karnataka was the state most heavily affected by the floods. R.V. Jagdish, a government spokesman, said that 172 deaths from the rains in the state were reported, and fifty thousand people are living in relief camps. The neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh reported at least fifty flood-related deaths. 1.5 million people residing in 100 relief camps across that state, chief minister K. Rosaiah said.Relief crews dispatched boats and helicopters to send rations to large numbers of villagers left stranded after torrential rains.No less than five million people have been sent to temporary government shelter areas following the heavy rains, which had flooded millions of acres of cropland.Ambrose Christy, the south zonal manager for anti-poverty group Caritas India, said that “we have never experience anything like this before. It is the worst flooding in 100 years. The situation could become even more severe as the rains get worst. If the Krishna River bursts its banks, millions more will be forced from their homes and a huge area of land will be underwater.”Police have arrested the owner of a mattress factory in Hay Hassini, Casablanca, Morocco which burned down in a disaster that claimed 55 lives. His son, who was the factory's manager, was also arrested.Those killed — 35 of whom were women — were trapped inside by locked fire exits, which were barricaded to stop theft during working hours. "The people who died were either asphyxiated or burned," commented a firefighter. 17 were wounded. Moustapha Taouil of the Casablanca civil protection service said the blaze was triggered by an inadequatly maintained electric saw on the ground floor. The initial fire quickly engulfed all four storeys of the building.The Rosamor factory was clearly operating unsafely, officials said. "It's a building with a ground floor and three upper floors specialising in making furniture, therefore there were highly inflammable products," said Taouil. "We confirmed during our examination that the owners of the premises failed to respect legal requirements for this kind of industry including staff training... the owner in contravention of the law, locked staff inside the plant apparently to prevent theft of raw material. It was this that prevented them getting out. The fire was caused by lack of proper maintenance of certain machines and electrical installations." He said a short circuit on the ground floor, which was filled with power saws, triggered the disaster.As a result of the investigatons, "The plant's owner, Adil Moufarreh, and his son Abdelali Moufarreh, who was the manager, have been taken into custody after having been questioned by police," said an official.28-year-old factory employee Fadila Khadija said "There was no emergency exit, the extinguishers were empty and the working conditions were difficult." One source said that windows were also unusable as they were covered with iron bars. 20-year-old survivor Omar Elaaz said "I was working on the first floor as an upholsterer. The smoke came up from the ground floor where the foam rubber, wood and glue are stored. I used a gas bottle to break the wire mesh that protects every window." 31-year-old upholsterer Hakim Hakki told of his own lucky escape and its effect on him from hospital: "I jumped from the third floor with four other colleagues while the women, who didn't dare to follow us, perished in the inferno. God saved me but I'll never forget those who died."The father of deceased 19-year-old Abdelazziz Darif said his son was paid 250 dirhams (20 euro/31 US dollars) per week and did not have social insurance.Mike Svonavec, the owner of the land in Somerset County, Pennsylvania where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed on September 11, 2001 has set a US$10 million price tag for his property, which is sought by the group, Families of Flight 93 and the United States National Park Service for building a memorial dedicated to those on the plane. Svonavec says that the price is fair market value for the 273 acre property and the organization would not be charged for the exact site of the crash. The organization has offered to buy the land for no more than $500,000 at least three times.Currently, the U.S. National Park Service only owns approximately 60 acres of the land. PBS Coals Inc. owns 864 acres of the land and Svonavec owns 273 acres. The entire field is nearly 2,000 acres.The permanent memorial is estimated to cost $58 million and is scheduled to be constructed starting in 2008 or 2009. On the ten-year anniversary of 9/11, a ribbon will be cut at the site.Svonavec has also placed a box on the crash site temporary memorial, where visitors can leave a "donation" to pay for his asking price for the land as well as the cost of  providing security at the site. Funding was provided for the cost of security, but in February the funds were already used up and Svonavec says he can no longer afford to keep the land maintained and secure. Reports say that the security company that is currently in charge of security charges $10,000 per month. "That land has been paid for with 40 lives...the donation box is an insult to that cost. I think Svonavec believes his land, because it has the blood of my cousin and 39 other people, it's worth more," said Patrick White, Vice President, Families of Flight 93.The Pacaya Volcano erupted on Friday. It is located 50 kilometers south of the capital of Guatemala, Guatemala City. Throughout the evening and night, volcanic ash fell in the municipalities of Amatitlán, Villa Nueva, and Guatemala City.President Álvaro Colom's government has decreed a State of Public Calamity in the Escuintla, Sacatepéquez and Guatemala departments, for 15 days or more, so the authorities can do their job correctly. The emergency response is being coordinated by the National Coordination for Disaster Reduction  (CONRED).The eruption was followed by several tremors. All flights in and out of Guatemala City's La Aurora International Airport, have been suspended. The eruption has caused many casualties, among them the death of Aníbal Archila, NOTI7's reporter, who was one of the first reporting the event.At 06:34 UTC today, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile, triggering a tsunami in the Pacific Ocean. The tsunami has already hit the French Polynesia islands, with waves reaching two metres (six feet) high damaging to the coast. In Fiji Japanese officials expect waves 2.3 metres (7.5 feet high). Australia and New Zealand are expected to receive waves of one metre (three feet) which are expected to hit within 24 hours of the earthquake.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there may be "widespread damage" from the waves, saying that "authorities should take appropriate action in response to this threat." In a special report, Wikinews looks at how different parts of the world have been affected by the disaster.Images of Pakistan International Airlines sacrificing a goat went viral on Monday as the beleaguered state-run airline resumed ATR flights. All ten ATRs in its fleet were grounded last week in the aftermath of a crash near Havelian earlier this month. PIA ground staff ritually slaughtered the black goat beside an ATR-42, the same type of aircraft lost in the disaster. The move is thought to ward off bad luck in Pakistan. The ATR-42 was the company's first ATR back in service following the crash. PIA said on December 15 they had chartered a Lockheed C-130 Hercules from the air force to resume cancelled services.PIA Flight 661, an ATR-42 just under ten years old, crashed into mountainous terrain in the Abbottabad region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa two weeks ago. The crash killed all 47 on board and left burning wreckage strewn for several kilometres.PIA still operate five ATR-42s and five ATR-72s. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced inspections on December 11. The airline expected disruption to flights to smaller airports. Flight 661 was heading to Islamabad, having taken off from Chitral on a domestic flight. The plane reported engine trouble and lost control before the crash.PIA sacrificed the goat at Islamabad's Benazir Bhutto International Airport, ahead of a successful test flight to Multan. PIA stated ground staff acted on their own volition and were not influenced by managers.Another PIA ATR experienced troubles ahead of takeoff on December 11 and aborted the flight. The airline denied local media claims an engine caught fire. Pakistani media has claimed Flight 661 was operating with some known technical faults. The Aviation Herald reports receiving information to the contrary, and the airline also denies this.The CAA has left decisions on returning aircraft to service at the discretion of PIA and ATR. A CAA letter to PIA expressed concern over engine failures at the airline, and accused PIA of "shortcomings in maintenance [and] quality assurance."The latest crash is the tenth time a PIA aircraft has been written off since 2000. Only one other such accident was fatal, the loss of PIA Flight 688 in 2006. Flight 668, a Fokker F-27, crashed on takeoff. The disaster killed 45. That accident also involved an engine failure and a loss of control.The ATR-42 can carry up to 48 passengers. It is a twin-engine turboprop capable of using unpaved runways. PIA said the C-130 would be used for flights to Gilgit. With one ATR-42 declared airworthy as of December 15 PIA also said flights to Chitral could be expected to resume soon. A flight on December 15 using the C-130 was postponed by one day.Chairman Azam Saigol quit on December 12 for what he said were personal reasons. He had been drafted in to replace Nasser Jaffer following controversy generated when crews staged strikes to protest planned privatisation. The airline loses around 12-to-15 billion rupees annually, with taxpayers making up the shortfall.Saigol has been on PIA's board since 2013. The company said it needed a chair since changing organisational structure under provisions in the Companies Ordinance of 1984. He became chairman in May and is a prominent industrialist nationally, heading up major organisations. Saigol had been working for free, PIA said on December 12 ahead of his resignation.The government has offered his job to several candidates, all of whom have turned it down.Another issue for the airline comes in the form of a recently-submitted notice in the Senate. Filed by the People's Party of Pakistan, it describes an 'illegal' sale of a PIA Airbus A-310 to a German firm. Senator Saleem Mandviwalla said the jet had a valid certificate of airworthiness and originally went to Malta to be used in a film. Mandviwalla said the plane ended up in the hands of a German museum and was sold without the PIA board's consent. Federal Minister Muhammad Zubair said the aircraft was sold for for 290,000 euros despite being worth millions. Mandviwalla has called for a criminal investigation.In the continuing Safety Investigation Board's investigation into Flight 661's crash, a team of French and Canadian experts from ATR reached Islamabad on December 12 and took forensic samples from the wreck site. The team, assisting the safety board, was also there to plan wreckage removal.The crash site is remote, with conventional vehicular access ending several kilometres away. Rescuers had to walk the remainder.PIA state the aircraft was maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, including engine changes. The airline also say the crashed plane's engines were inspected, as standard, ahead of its final flight. An airline spokesperson asked journalists to refrain from speculating on the accident's cause.Bodies have been identified using DNA analysis, with at least sixteen returned to families. Identification was undertaken by the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS).The dead included six members of the same family, leaving behind a fourteen-year-old girl. Haseena Gul is entitled to tens of millions of rupees (equivalent to hundreds of thousands of euros) in compensation and numerous people have come forward claiming to be her relatives; she had remained with a friend in Chitral to study while her family travelled to Islamabad.Gul is currently receiving treatment from PIMS for psychological problems. "They will not let me study in Chitral," she appealed to the government. "Please have me shifted to Islamabad where I can study and fulfil my parents' dream."Also on board was Junaid Jamshed, a celebrated popstar who abandoned music in favour of preaching after joining Tableeghi Jamaat. Jamshed ran a nationally successful fashion business. His wife joined him on the flight. Other passengers included Osama Warraich, who was a senior civil servant in Chitral, and two infants.On Monday, Flight 898 to Kuala Lumpur diverted to Karachi. A replacement aircraft reached its destination over four hours late. PIA denied media claims the original plane suffered bursts in its hydraulics, but did not clarify what had happened. Also on Monday Flight 764 from from Jeddah to Faisalabad arrived ten hours late. All 130 passengers had their luggage left behind; PIA said it could take up to two days before they were reunited with their belongings.A suicide bomber attacked an emergency room of a hospital in Quetta, located in southwest Pakistan, killing eight people, including three policemen. Approximately 35 people were wounded in the attack. The explosion occurred in the Civil Hospital of the city."The latest death toll is eight," Qazi Abdul Wahid, police chief of the province, told Agence France-Presse news agency. He said that two senior police officers, a police commando along with a cameraman for a local television channel, died in the attack. Four other journalists were wounded, he added. Hospital authorities confirmed these figures. Television footage showed rescuers carrying away the dead and the injured from the scene of the incident."It appears to be sectarian violence," Wahid added. "Evidence collected so far indicate it (the blast) was a suicide attack," he commented. Mohammad Iqbal, another police official stated "it was a suicide attack." "We have found legs and head from the blast site. We have also found metal pellets, usually stuffed in suicide vests, from the blast site", Iqbal noted.The hospital was full of journalists who were reporting about the shooting of a bank manager belonging to the Shiite community. Mohammad Sabir, another police official, claimed the room was full of the manager's friends and family when the suicide bomber attacked.Quetta is the capital of the Baluchistan province of the country. It has frequently witnessed disputes and clashes between the Sunni and Shiite communities. Several people have died in multiple conflicts in the province. In February this year, suspected Sunni insurgents blew up a bus with Shiite worshippers. Two hours after the incident, a hospital treating the victims was attacked. 25 people died in that incident, with 100 being injured.Three bombs were detonated near the U.S. consulate in Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan on Monday. The attack occurred within hours of a suicide blast during a political rally which killed 38 people, according to officials.According to reports, a gun battle followed the attacks. Smoke clouds were seen over the region; several buildings collapsed due to the blast. "I saw attackers in two vehicles. Some of them carried rocket-propelled grenades. They first opened fire at security personnel at the post near the consulate and then blasts went off," eyewitness Siraj Afridi told Reuters news agency.Other residents claimed the blast near the U.S. consulate was followed by two successive blasts in the same area. The US consulate in Islamabad denied receiving any information. Witnesses stated that soldiers had cut and ordered people to remain inside their houses. Helicopters of the Pakistani security forces hovered overhead.A doctor at the principal hospital in the city, which is close to the Afghanistan border and has been affected by numerous bomb explosions in the past year, claimed one person had been killed and one wounded. No official information about the death toll was available. Security forces were in search of the attackers, according to officials."There were three blasts. The first happened at a security post while two others about 200 meters away, near the consulate," an unidentified local security official, told Reuters news agency. "We don't know exactly whether any attackers are left. The area has been cordoned off and forces are clearing it," he added.Marium Mukhtiar yesterday became the first Pakistani female fighter pilot to die on duty when a jet aircraft crashed near Kundian, in Punjab's Mianwali district.The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) said Flying Officer Mukhtiar and male colleague Squadron Leader Saqib Abbasi faced a "serious in-flight emergency" while training in an F7-PG fighter. After taking evasive action to avoid a residential area the pilots were left with insufficient altitude to safely eject. Both ejected and were injured; Mukhtiar died in hospital whilst Abbasi sustained minor injuries.The PAF said Mukhtiar "embraced shahadat [martyrdom] and became the first lady pilot from PAF to attain this great honour," crediting Abbasi's survival as possibly down to his escaping several seconds prior to Mukhtiar. The duo "handled the serious emergency with professionalism and courage and tried to save the ill-fated aircraft till the very last minute," according to the PAF.The PAF estimates it has around 30 female fighter pilots. The force began recruiting women in 2003 and in 2006 the nation's first seven female fighter pilots began service.Early this morning, an express passenger train (carrying about 700 passengers) derailed in Pakistan, leaving at least 56 dead and 150 more injured. At least ten of the carriages that comprised the service between Karachi and Lahore left the track and fell down an embankment, ripping them apart.The disaster occurred some 250 miles north of Karachi at 2:00 a.m. PST (UTC+5). Pakistan Railways says it appears the derailment, which sent carriages hurtling into a waterlogged field adjacent to the track, was caused by extreme cold, which in turn caused a welded joint in the track to contract and split. Brigadier Nazhar Jamil, head of an army rescue team presently on-site, said he believed another possible cause was excessive speed in combination with inadequate maintenance.State-run PTV said that Asad Saeed, General Manager of Pakistan Railways, had told them "A welded track joint broke. Tracks shrink in winter. There are many forces on the track and sometimes this joint breaks." He went on to rule out terrorist involvement and point out that the tracks are old and the government is midway through a programme to replace them. He said other services were not affected.The violence of the crash ripped carriages apart, leaving wreckage strewn across the surrounding area. A segment of one of the rails was torn up, and the engine came to rest approximately a mile away from the initial site of the derailment. Sources vary on how many carriages were involved. The Times says ten carriages derailed and does not state the total number in the train, while Sky News reports that twelve of the train's sixteen carriages derailed and Xinhua gives the numbers as fifteen cars of a seventeen-car train. Reports on passenger numbers also vary, with the train carrying between 700 and 900 passengers, mostly returning from the Islamic holiday of Eid ul-Adha.Jamil told reporters that many lives were saved by local residents, who rushed many of the wounded to hospital using rickshaws, scooters and donkey-drawn carts. Army engineers had to free the last survivors from the wreckage using two rail-mounted cranes and cutting equipment. One of the last to be rescued was a three-year-old girl, who's foot was seriously injured.Police and soldiers carried the wounded to waiting ambulances, which rushed them to three nearby hospitals.President Pervez Musharraf has ordered an immediate inquiry, which will be conducted by Pakistan Railways. The inquiry will examine whether any responsibility must be taken by any of those involved, as well as ways of preventing another similar disaster from taking place.Fatal train accidents occur with some regularity in Pakistan, a problem frequently exacerbated by overcrowding. This is the worst accident since the Ghotki rail crash in 2005. Over 120 people were then killed as the Karachi Express—the same service as in this accident—hit a train that had broken down from behind; the wreckage from both these trains was then struck by a third passenger express. The driver of the Karachi Express had misread a signal.Over the course of the weekend, Palau's police shot a Chinese fisherman believed to be illegally fishing in the economic zone of the tiny Micronesian nation. Three police staff, who were patrolling territorial waters in search of the Chinese fishing mothership, are feared missing as their plane was not heard from in over forty-eight hours.The shooting occurred after the police tried to contact the boat and warn them to leave Palau's territorial water, and subsequent warning shots being fired to again warn the boat away from the area.Five Chinese fishermen were arrested following the shooting, and were charged with illegal fishing and unlawful entry.  They may face up to two years in jail and be required to pay a US$50,000 fine if found guilty of entering Palau illegally.Police officer Helenda Oimei is quoted by the Agence France-Presse in affidavit as saying, "The confrontation included an officer involved shooting and one of the six individuals on the green fishing boat later succumbed to injuries he obtained during the confrontation."Palau President Johnson Toribiong has spoken to the press about the missing plane, confirming the police plane was believed to have crashed and that a pilot and two police officers are amongst the missing. The president is quoted by the Agence France-Presse as saying in regards to what the police plane occupants were doing, "They left on a police mission to film the area where a [Chinese] mothership involved in the raid of Kayangel State's marine resources was burned by its own crew to destroy the ship and its cargo. Officer Earl Decherong, one of the two police officers on board, using a radio telephone, called to say they were gliding to make a water landing and that they could see no light or land." An extensive search thus far failed to find the crash site.  Home to world's first and largest shark sanctuary that was created in 2009 and is 630,000 square kilometers in size, Palau actively guards this territory.A group of 41 paleontologists and researchers reaffirmed the cause of dinosaur extinction.  The research team concluded that a giant asteroid killed dinosaurs over 65 million years ago.  The asteroid crashed into Yucatán, Mexico creating the Chicxulub crater.  Their report was published Friday in the academic journal Science.In 1980, Louis Alvarez and son, Walter, had published a paper stating that an asteroid had killed the dinosaurs.  The Chicxulub crater was also discovered in Mexico at approximately that same time, therefore the theory gained scientific acceptance.  More recent explanations of the cause of dinosaur's extinction included that perhaps volcanic eruptions on Deccan traps or multiple asteroid crashes ended the dinosaurs' existence.The team performed chemical analyses of soil and fossil samples, where a high concentration of iridium (which is commonly found in asteroids and meteors) was found, which dated back to the approximate time of the asteroid crash. The asteroid measured approximately 7.5 miles wide, and hit with an impact of one billion times the force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.  The impact would have immediately killed all animals and plant life within the radius of half of a continent.  With such an impact, debris would have flown into the air and then fallen back into the atmosphere with the force of a ballistic missile.The crash of this asteroid into the earth would have also caused the equivalent of the heat of ten noonday suns, which would have burned the skin or feathers of dinosaurs, and created wildfires on any plant life which had survived to that point. The crash would have also triggered massive earthquakes and tsunamis, possibly causing parts of continents to fall into the ocean.The area of Yucatán which the asteroid struck had also been rich in sulfur, which was blasted out of the earth and into the sky, where it would have mixed with water vapors, creating clouds that rained sulfuric acid, and which would block out the sun for approximately a decade.A Muslim preacher has used a Gaza radio station to praise the "blessed actions" of those responsible for the London terror attacks. The unidentified preacher made an appearance Saturday on the controversial station Sawt Al-Quds, during which he praised both the London attacks and the assassination of Egypt's Ambassador to Iraq, Ihab al-Sherif.In a statement translated by the right-wing Israel National News, the preacher also attributed the bomb attacks in London to Osama bin Laden, saying they were a timely response from the terrorist leader to scenes of public celebration following London's successful Olympic bid. "The sirens of joy were heard in Britain, and Osama bin Laden again redrew the map, thus announcing that the voice of the subjugated will be heard everywhere."[1]Sawt Al-Quds ("Voice of Jerusalem") is a Syrian-based radio station broadcasting to the Gaza Strip. It is believed to be affiliated with Islamic Jihad.The London bombings have been condemned by many Muslim clerics. Speaking of the response by Iraqis to the London bombings, a UK spokesperson for the Multi-National Division (South-East) said, "Most of the feed back from Friday pray[ers] in the British Area of Operation were against the attacks on London."People living on the Indonesian island of Sumatra have fled their homes after an earthquake of magnitude of 6.7 hit the area earlier today. Although the quake was not powerful enough to cause a tsunami, the event sparked fears of a repeat of the December 26 magnitude 9.3 earthquake in which around 300,000 people died. Today's tremor struck 70 miles southwest of Padang, a city in western Sumatra, yet no damage has been reported so far.An Indonesia Geophysics and Meteorology Agency official said: "Many people in Padang are panicking. People have left their houses, especially those living on the coast."The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, said in a statement: "Earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a few hundred kilometres of the earthquake epicentre." Scientists are cautious that another major earthquake could occur along the Indian Ocean faultline, which has seen a number of minor tremors since the December 26 quake. Although most countries have a contingency plan for earthquake related disasters, a tsunami warning system for South Asia will not be ready until the end of 2006.A Paris fire in a hotel killed 22 people, 10 of whom were children, while injuring 53 — 11 seriously. The hotel was an overcrowded, budget accommodation type of housing. Most of the inhabitants were African, many housed by social services, according to an Associated Press report.The 32 room, six-story Paris Opera hotel, was made to house 61 guests, but 90 were staying at the time of the fire, with 84 of them placed by city or state social services.The fire is thought to have started in the breakfast room at 2:20 am Friday, local time.Along with the Africans, who were mostly refugees, others wounded included French, Senegalese, Portuguese, Americans, Ukrainians, and Tunisians, according to a report from Turkish Zaman.com. The hotel is situated near to La Galerie Lafayette, Printemps shopping center, and Paris Opera.It took nearly 250 fire-fighters to control the fire, and the number of casualties was high because of the single exit."It’s hard in that kind of situation to tell people to calm down. They jumped. People on the first floor threw their children out the windows," Alfred Millot, head of the fire service at the nearby upmarket Galeries Lafayette department store, told Agence France-Presse."With our own equipment, we started fighting the fire from the ground floor. I came running and people were already jumping through the windows," said Millot. His store warehouse was used as a temporary morgue. Families were counselled and assisted in re-uniting by the Red Cross.A 40-foot section of scenic Highway 1 about 12 miles south of Carmel, California crumbled into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, preventing access to the popular tourist area of  Big Sur from the north.The collapse of the southbound lane of the two-lane highway, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, follows several days of rain. The soil under the northbound lane is also in danger of giving way. Drivers heading north were blocked at the Bixby Creek Bridge; the rest of the  road has been closed to traffic indefinitely. A long closure is expected to hurt the tourist business upon which Big Sur and and the tiny surrounding communities depend.The  California Highway Patrol (CHP) said no one was injured.The section that collapsed is on a curve south of the Rocky Creek Bridge,  where the highway clings to  the scenic Santa Lucia Mountains, and near the Bixby Creek Bridge,  one of the "iconic" arch bridges that make this stretch of the highway with its dramatic vistas such a well-known scenic drive.The cause of the collapse was not apparent as the road surface looked new, and no seeping water was visible. "It's basically just nature," a CHP officer  said.With Highway 1 closed, drivers wishing to access Big Sur from the north could go inland on Highway 101  and pass through  the Salinas Valley. To return to the coast drivers must pass over a steep, winding mountainous road. This route adds at least an hour to the journey.Part of the facade at the Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum located at 220 North Street in Buffalo has crumbled causing bricks to fall into Elmwood Avenue.At approximately 11:20 p.m. (eastern time) on Sunday night February 17, a call was placed into 911 stating that bricks from a wall, a nearly 150 foot section of the upper facade, were lying in the middle of Elmwood after falling off the building. The fire department had to shut down Elmwood from North Street to Allen at 11:30 p.m. until further notice due to the debris and risk to public safety.No one was injured in the incident, but at least one parked car was damaged by falling bricks.Though no weather warnings have been issued for the City, winds with gusts up to 50 miles per hour have been reported through the night. It is not known if the wind played a factor in the damage to the building.City engineers were on scene discussing how to handle the situation and clean up what has already fallen.The museum is the world's largest collection of documents which are owned privately. The Buffalo building was originally a Church of Christ built in 1911.Part of the E6 main road near Munkedal in Bohuslän in the west of Sweden has collapsed in a landslide. The first report was received by emergency services at 19.17 CET. 26 people were involved in the incident, when the road collapsed under them in a landslide. About 500 metres of the road slid down a slope into a small stream alongside, leaving a crater 200 metres wide and two to three metres deep. Both sides of the road (which in this area is single carriageway) have collapsed and the road has now been closed by the emergency services between Saltkällan and Torp.Police spokesperson Thomas Fuxborg said to SVT that "it is a very large accident". So far no fatalities have been reported, and SVT news programme Aktuellt reports that all the people involved in the accident have been rescued and have only suffered minor injuries (video of news broadcast; video showing the scene of the accident). On the morning of 21 December SVT reported that all 26 people involved in the incident had been rescued. Though none of them had major injuries 13 people were taken to hospital, of which all but one had been discharged by the morning of 21 December. The injuries consisted of "some broken arms and legs and back pains, and many shocked of course," according to Lars-Göran Eskilsson, deputy head of rescue services in Uddevalla.The site of the landslide is the most recently opened section of the E6, which has been undergoing rebuilding work. The cause of the landslide is not known, but there is speculation that the unusually heavy rain that has recently hit the area could have undermined the road. Geologists have warned that there may be further landslides, so the safety cordons are being moved back. "Work is currently underway to move the cordons back to secure the area," said Leif Larsson, head of rescue services in Uddevalla, on the night of 20 December. Two properties nearby have been evacuated because of the risk for further landslides.According to Göteborgs-Posten, the Bohusbanan railway line (which runs parallel with the E6 road) has also been affected. The landslide reportedly cut an electricity line leaving the railway without power. A passenger train on its way from Munkedal was stopped only 600-700 metres from the scene of the landslide. SVT reports that 300 metres of the railway embankment has collapsed.The E6 is the main road between Oslo, the capital city of Norway, and Gothenburg, so the landslide is expected to cause major disruption to traffic. The 15,000 vehicles that pass the collapsed section of road every day will be rerouted on minor roads via Dals-Ed. Vehicles coming from the south will have to leave the E6 before the Uddevalla bridge and follow roads 174, 166 and 164 before returning to the motorway at Skee. "There will be very big diversions, about 50-60 kilometres. We will have long queues because it involves many vehicles and much smaller roads," said Tomas Andersson, crisis manager at the Swedish National Road Administration. More information is available on the Swedish National Road Administration website.Reports say that a large three-story stable which partially collapsed in Buffalo, New York on June 11, and caused as many as five home to be evacuated, is likely to be demolished.During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to 428 Jersey Avenue after residents called 911 stating that part of the building had collapsed. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighboring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.The city's preservation board held an emergency meeting today to discuss the issue. Wikinews has learned that the owner of the building, Bob Freudenheim, gave the city permission to demolish the building because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim was part-owner of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and was also an advocate to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. He also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.Freudenheim has been facing housing violations due to the poor conditions of the building."We had a letter of violation against him. He was supposed to have started work to stabilize the brick this Monday. We all hope this building could be saved. But we've got five houses evacuated and we cannot tolerate any further delay. We've got to get people back into their homes in a safe condition," said Richard Tobe, Commissioner of the city's Permit and Inspection Services.Demolition on the building is expected to begin next week, but area residents are not happy and say they will fight to keep the building in place."They're going to have to trash our backyard to do it. So I hope they have to have our permission, because we're not going to give it lightly. I'm sure it's the biggest and architecturally significant livery stable still standing. I can't see any reason to take it down just because of one hole," stated Joe Murray, a resident on Richmond and Jersey who lives behind the collapsed portion of the building.Mike Lombardo, the Commissioner for the Buffalo Fire Department, believes that the building was built in 1812 or 1814, making it nearly 200 years old. It is one of only three stables still standing in the city.If the building is to be demolished, Freudenheim will end up paying the city nearly US$300,000 to get the job done.Rain and the storm surge from Hurricane Rita have overwhelmed one of the fragile levees in New Orleans.  The Industrial Canal levee gave way, reflooding parts of the Ninth Ward.  There are three significant breaches."Our worst fears came true," said Maj. Barry Guidry of the Georgia National Guard."We have three significant breaches in the levee and the water is rising rapidly," he said. "At daybreak I found substantial breaks and they've grown larger."The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimated that 6 inches of rainfall could breach the previously damaged levees. The Ninth Ward, which saw flooding as high as 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, is currently in waist-high water as the nearby levee was overtopped. Water is spilling over the levee in a section 100 feet wide.The Gentilly neighborhood has water accumulations of 6 to 8 inches deep as the patched London Avenue Canal has sprung leaks near its base.Portions of a DC-10 jet registered to the Miami, Florida-based Arrow Cargo company fell from the sky over a residential area in the city of Manaus, Brazil on Thursday.Parts of one of the turbines of the aircraft caused some damage to a car and a few houses, but no injuries were reported. The airplane was traveling to its destination of Bogota, Colombia. According to the Brazilian Defense Ministry, the parts that detached are the rear exhaust diffuser and a section of the exhaust. The involved plane, registered N526MD, was built in 1978."I opened the window after I heard this huge boom and I see this thing up in flames, right in front of my doorway," said Aparecida Silva, a local resident, to Globo TV. "I had no idea what it was, I thought it was some weird, ugly thing or a UFO or something." ((Translated from Portuguese))Portuguese language: ‍Estava no melhor do sono, ouvi uma pancada, abri a janela e vi algo pegando fogo. Aí eu não sabia o que era e disse: é um bicho feio, um extraterrestre ou algo assim.Rai Marinho, a representative for the Arrow Cargo in Manaus, said that the jet, which was carrying an engineer and three crew members, had engine difficulties soon after taking off. It was able to keep flying, but was obliged to divert to Medellin due to inclement weather, where it landed without incident. The representative added that his company would pay residents for the damage.A Russian passenger plane has crashed after landing at Irkutsk Airport, in Siberia and up to 150 people are feared dead in the crash. At 7:44 a.m. local time (2244 UTC Saturday), the plane veered off the rain-slipped runway as it was landing, tore through a concrete barrier, and crashed into the nearby garage buildings, causing the plane to burst into flames. Witnesses have said that the aircraft appeared out of control shortly before touchdown, and was travelling at a terrific speed.There were 192 passengers and 8 crew onboard the aircraft. So far, 68 passengers have emerged injured and 124 bodies have been recovered. Russian officials suggest that the final death toll is likely to be closer to 150. None of the crew has survived. Many of the passengers were holidaymakers, and there were many children onboard. A few of the survivors are said to owe their lives to a flight attendant, who managed to open the emergency escape hatch in the rear of the aircraft.  The Aircraft was an Airbus A310, travelling from Moscow airport.A failure of brakes on a wet runway was cited as the possible cause of the crash (although unlikely).A passenger was killed Monday evening after a fire started in a washroom aboard a train near Leighton Buzzard, in Bedfordshire, England. Emergency services were called to the London Midland train, where they found the body of a female passenger who had suffered burns.British Transport Police confirmed one female individual was killed in the blaze. A spokesperson said: "The deceased woman has injuries consistent with burns, no other person is believed to have been involved in the incident. Officers from the fire and ambulance services are on the scene."The fire has caused serious disruption to trains on the West Coast Main Line. A spokesperson for Network Rail said they were attempting to reopen two of the four tracks on the line as London Midland scrambled to organise a replacement bus service.London Midland said no-one else was injured in the incident. "The fire appeared to have been in the toilet," a spokesperson said. "A passenger reported the fire to a conductor. All the other passengers got off safely."The flight had departed from Belgium, and safely landed at 11:49 A.M. Eastern Time."The captain of Continental Flight 61, which was en route from Brussels to Newark, died in flight, apparently of natural causes," said a spokeswoman for the airline in an email.According to the airline, there was an additional relief pilot on board who took over control of the plane after the initial pilot died.247 people were on board. There are no reports of any injuries.A passenger plane carrying tourists, has crash-landed at an airport near Mount Everest killing 18 of the 19 people on board. Of those killed were 12 German, two Australian and two Nepalese tourists. The remaining three were the plane's crew who were of Nepalese decent. The only survivor was the pilot-in-command.The twin engine DeHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter plane, operated by Yeti Airlines, was flying in Nepal from the nation's capital of Kathmandu to Lukla. It was landing at the Lukla Airport when its wheels got caught on a fence at the end of the runway, causing it to hit the runway and burst into flames. Firefighters fought for nearly two hours before bringing the fire under control.Officials blame the crash on heavy fog and bad weather. Reports state that visibility was only 1,310 feet (400 meters), which was considered to be just enough for the plane to land."According to initial reports we have it crashed before it was to land and caught fire. The accident was probably caused by a last minute change in the weather," said Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal chief, Yagya Prasad Gautam.There was at least one accident at the airport in 2005 when nine people survived a crash, only suffering minor injures. That plane was operated by Gorkha Airlines.An Itek-Air Boeing 737 flight 6875, operated by Aseman Airlines and traveling to Iran has crashed in Kyrgyzstan only 10 minutes after taking off. It is unclear how many were on board, but reports say there were at least 90 people on the plane with the crash killing 68. At least 22 are reported to have survived, including all crew members."According to updated information, 68 passengers were killed, including 24 Kyrgyz, five Iranians, one Turkish national, three Canadians, three Kazakhs and one Chinese," said a spokesman for Igor Chudinov, Kyrgyzstan's prime minister.Reports state that members of the crew reported "technical issues" with the plane shortly after take off from Manas International Airport in Kyrgyzstan. Within 10 minutes the crew reported a severe loss of cabin pressure. When the plane made an emergency landing, it burst into flames. The plane was headed to Tehran, Iran.The United States military has sent rescue equipment and crews from its base at the airport to assist the government in the incident.A passenger ship, the Voyager enroute between Spain's Balearic Islands to the Italian island of Sardinia, radioed a distress call earlier today after getting into difficulties in heavy seas. A huge wave shattered a bridge window, damaging control systems inside.The Bahamian-registered ship is carrying 776 passengers and crew, 480 of them Spanish. Some sustained minor injuries when the ship sailed into the storm at 8am UTC today. French and Spanish tugs have been dispatched to assist the vessel, and the British gas tanker Gimi has diverted to offer help and is relaying radio signals from the stricken ship. Voyager "is in a difficult situation but is not drifting", according to the French coastguard, with only a single propeller still providing force.The ship was sailing from Tunis to Barcelona when she encountered the storm. The crew have restored power to two of her four engines and she is now diverting to Tunis, and is expected to reach port on Tuesday.The Panamanian-flagged cruise ship MV Ushuaia, operated by Antarpply Expeditions of Argentina, ran aground near Cape Anna at the entrance to Wilhelmina Bay. Having been stuck on rocks in the Antarctic Peninsula, it suffered a puncture in two diesel fuel tanks, and was leaking fuel and taking on a "minimal amount of water." It had two cracks, but is not in danger of sinking. The passengers were rescued by Achiles, a Chilean Navy ship, which took them to Chile's Base Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva in Antarctica. The station has a 1300 metre-long airstrip which can facilitate airlifts for the passengers. They will be taken by a Hercules C-130 plane to the Port of Ushuaia, from which they can be flown back to South America.Argentine Admiral Daniel Martin Alberto said that the 89 passengers onboard were all in good health. Argentina and Chile are both sending a rescue mission to the stricken ship, with 40 crew members. The Antarctic Dream, at seven nautical miles away, was reported to have changed course to collect and transfer passengers to Tierra del Fuego. However, the Chilean Navy got to Ushuaia first.The Australian Antarctic Division announced that "as well as the New Zealander, there were 11 Australians, 12 Americans, 14 Dutch, nine Germans, seven Britons, six Chinese, six Spaniards, five Swiss, three Italians, two Irish, two French, two Canadians, a Cypriot and a Belgian. The crew consisted of 28 Argentinians, eight Chileans, three Uruguayans, and one Spaniard."Meanwhile, Jon Bowermaster, a writer aboard the National Geographic Explorer, described the situation: "We had hurricane winds yesterday — 103 miles per hour (166 kilometres per hour) and gusting — which may have contributed to the grounding."Although there is no major leak, containment efforts are being made by Chilean navy ship Lautaro to stem the fuel leak, which has spread for half a mile around the stranded ship. Salvaging the ship, however, was proving more of a problem.A European Union peacekeeping helicopter crashed near Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina yesterday, killing the four servicemen on board. Two were German and two were Spanish.The helicopter belonged to Spain and was deployed as part of the EUFOR peacekeeping mission, which Spain and Germany have 250 and 130 soldiers engaged in respectively. It was a German-built Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm BO-105. Spain's defence ministry named the deceased Spaniards as Lieutenant Santiago Hormigo Ledesma and Sergeant Joaquin Lopez Moreno. The Germans have not been named.The cause of the accident is unknown, but the crash was witnessed by a second military helicopter in the area at the time. They reported seeing smoke from the helicopter but little else because the mountainous and forested terrain impeded their view. It is also known that the aircraft departed Sarajevo on a routine flight and crashed half an hour later after issueing a distress call. An investigation is ongoing.The bodies were recovered today. The Spaniards were flown home on a C-130 military transport plane, after a short ceremony in which a Spanish general placed medals upon the coffins in the presence of the Spanish ambassador and EUFOR officials.A EUFOR spokesman said the bodies of the Germans will probably be flown home on Monday.A 23-year-old Kenyan man was crushed and killed and three others died after a helicopter crashed in Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada on May 13. All on board the helicopter, two passengers and the pilot of the helicopter, were also killed. Considered a freak accident, the attention was not centered around the crash or those killed in it, but whether or not the volume on the iPod the 23-year-old pedestrian was allegedly listening to was too loud.Isaiah Otieno, a student at the College of the Rockies arrived in Canada two years ago and was the son of Dalmas Otieno, Kenya's Minister of State for Public Service. He was walking down the street to retrieve his mail when the Bell 206 helicopter crashed on top of him, crushed him, then dragged his body along the pavement, with the helicopter bursting into flames. The helicopter pilot was unable to maintain altitude when it crashed, killing Otieno and those inside the helicopter, instantly. The cause of the crash is not known and is still being investigated, but media outlets such as The Globe and Mail criticized the boy for wearing headphones and having the volume turned up too high, which allegedly caused him not to hear the aircraft falling from the sky."He was a brilliant student, very considerate, very aggressive at times. He had strong leadership qualities. Everybody here is just shattered," stated Dalmas.Despite the reports that Otieno was listening to his iPod, there has been no independent confirmation of those reports. Wikinews e-mailed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to confirm or deny the iPod reports, but has not yet received a response. Other deaths have been blamed on media players like the iPod. In 2007, a boy was killed after a train struck him in Grimsby, Ontario. The boy, who had headphones on at the time, was unable to hear the sounds of the train's horn as it approached, which subsequently struck and killed him.The helicopter was owned by Bighorn Helicopters and was rented to BC Hydro, the Province's power and water authority. The Pilot has been identified as Edward William Kyle Heeb, 57. The other two individuals killed were employees for BC Hydro and have been identified as Dirk Bentley Rozenboom, 45 and Robert William Lehmann, 37. They were checking power lines along 14th street in Cranbrook, when according to witnesses, the engine stopped and the helicopter crashed in the intersection of 14th and 10th.Despite the reports, a Canadian music consultant states that the accident involving the helicopter cannot be blamed on the use of Otieno's iPod."The average downtown street registers at around 60 decibels. A jet plane flying overhead is generally quoted at 120 to 130 decibels. If you are playing your music loud enough to cut out that level of noise, then you have it cranked to a degree that is damaging your hearing," said Geordon Hoag.Ten people are dead and up to 200 injured after three trains crashed in Glendale, a suburb of Los Angeles. Two passenger trains and a freight train carrying gravel collided at 6:05 a.m. local time during the morning rush hour. Both passenger trains were double-decker Metrolink trains, one northbound from Union Station, the other southbound. One train overturned, and the other caught fire.The northbound train normally carries 30 to 50 passengers. The southbound train normally has 200 to 250 people on board.Over 300 firefighters are attending the scene.The chief of police of Glendale reported at a press conference that a man trying to commit suicide drove his car onto the train tracks, but apparently changed his mind and left the vehicle before the impact, leaving the vehicle on the tracks. The suspect was taken into custody by police officers who arrived at the scene of the accident and has, according to the police, already admitted driving the vehicle onto the tracks.Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the gunman who killed eight people in the Jokela school shooting in Finland yesterday, has died in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head."He died at 22h14 of a one-bullet injury in the head," said traumatology physician Eero Hirvensalo, chief of the Helsinki University Hospital.Auvinen, 18, murdered his headmistress, school nurse and six students, as well as wounding one other victim, before turning his gun on himself.When police special units arrived on-scene and entered the school they were initially shot at, but when they reached Auvinen he was already unconscious, and no rounds were fired by the police.Auvinen had no previous criminal convictions, and had received his gun license several weeks previously. He purchased his gun on October 19.In a text describing himself on the video sharing site YouTube, where he had posted a total of 89 videos, including some showing him firing his gun and others directly referring to the killing, he said that he was "a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist.""I am prepared to fight and die for my cause," he continued. "I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection."Peruvian scientists confirmed on September 20 that the crater found Saturday in the Puno region, of Peru by local villagers and blamed for a mass illness affecting 200 people was likely caused by a meteorite. Jose Ishitsuka, of Peru's Geophysics Institute, found a three-inch magnetic fragment that contained iron, which is common in all rocks from space. The impact also registered a magnitude 1.5 earthquake, equivalent to 4.9 tons of dynamite exploding. Jay Melosh, an expert on impact craters and professor of planetary science at the University of Arizona, was initially skeptical that the crater was caused by a meteorite, but recently said, "It begins to sound more likely to me that this object could indeed be a meteorite."The crater made by the meteorite measured 15 feet deep and 65 feet wide.It turns out that dogs may not be the only 'man's best friend.' A parrot in Muncie, Indiana is being credited with saving the lives of its owners.According to the owner 33-year-old Shannon Conwell along with his 9-year-old son were watching television when they both fell asleep on the living room couch when a fire began to spread through the house around 3:00 a.m. on Friday October 19.The Amazon, yellow-headed Parrot named Peanut reportedly imitates the sounds of several objects and began to emit one very similar to a fire alarm, waking the family from their sleep."He was really screaming his head off. I grabbed my son and my bird and got out of the house," said Conwell who also said that the fire alarm was also going off, but the bird woke her and her son.  Conwell said that there were several pieces of medical equipment inside the house that also make a lot of noise. The equipment was there due to an accidental finger amputation which occurred only a few hours prior to the fire.A bedroom, the kitchen and the dining room were all severely damaged in the fire, but no one was injured or killed. The fire department says that they are currently investigating the incident and have not said what the cause was.A powerful blast has razed a fireworks factory 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of the Philippines capital Manila shortly before noon on Thursday, killing at least eight people and injuring more than 70 others, Cavite Governor Ayong Maliksi said. Four of the eight fatalities have already been identified by factory officials. They are: Clodelio Iso, Rodelio Iso, Marlon Rodrin, Angelo Francisco and Gerardo Amparo. The fire was declared to be out at around 2:33 p.m. local time (UTC+8).Most of the explosion victims were employees of the Starmaker Fireworks Factory (SFF) located in Barangay Conchu, Trece Martires City. They were rushed to the General Emilio Aguinaldo Memorial Hospital, Korean-Philippines Friendship Hospital, Treceno Medical Pavillion and Mark Jem Hospital, and are still being treated for third-degree burns and cuts from glass shards, said Ryan Lucero, acting area manager of SFF factory and the Office of the Civil Defense-Regional Disaster Coordinating Center.Richard Rivera, SFF spokesman, said the firm meets "global security standards." Founded in 1995, the firm pioneered synchronized music and pyrotechnics, which it also exported to other countries. SFF has promised to extend aid to the blast victims. "The company is saddened over what happened," he said. The accidental fire sparked by the fireworks blast has spread to the nearby Yoshita corporation.Several houses and a church near the fireworks factory were also damaged by the powerful blast which created several craters inside the factory's compound. One crater measured at least 200 meters wide. "It was really frightening. We scampered for safety because the ground was shaking and on fire. Then, body parts started flying around together with metal and wooden debris," said Juanito Salvatos, a gardener who was near the factory.According to Cavite police Superintendent Reynaldo Galam, the mutilated bodies of two men and a woman were recovered outside the SFF compound near a residential area in Trece Martires city. Jonathan Seramillo, Cavite NBI medico legal officer, said a commercial area, including the Cavite Provincial Capitol, suffered damages even both are one kilometer away from the explosion site, while 2 vehicles were also damaged."The 10:45 a.m. explosion inside the half hectare SFF pyrotechnics compound was so loud that it was heard as far as 500 meters away from the scene of the blast," said Galam. "The explosion was so powerful that it broke window panes even at the municipal hall more than a kilometer away,” said Mayor Melencio de Sagun Jr. The explosion has also caused part of the factory roof to land more than 1.5km (1 mile) away, and toppled concrete walls. Sagun Jr. has cited reports that "the incident stemmed from a test of fireworks that went awry," adding that the fireworks were to be delivered to the SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City. "The one who tested it violated a rule barring testing inside the compound," he added, and explained that the factory is inside an industrial zone. The blast has also shattered the glass of two adjacent semi-conductor plants, injuring some of the employees."Shockwaves shattered windows and toppled concrete fences of nearby homes, knocking out electricity and raining down unexploded fireworks in the area," said Army Col. Romeo Ucag, who assisted in putting out the blaze, adding, "he heard the explosion and saw a thick column of smoke from his post in Tanza, Cavite, six miles (10 kilometers) north of Trece Martires."Amid thick black smoke enveloping the fireworks factory three hours after the explosion, human body parts have scattered meters away from the fireworks factory. "There are body parts scattered outside," said Galam, adding that "police and health officials were trying to account for the estimated 100 staff." According to Senior Superintendent Hernando Zafra, director of the Cavite provincial police, "they could not yet determine the cause of the explosion, which was heard by people three kilometers away from the site." Authorities have also continued to sift through the rubble of the explosion. Zafra has said most of the victims could not be identified because their bodies have been dismembered and charred beyond recognition. Earlier, he has counted 43 people inside the factory being treated for injuries. Zafra has further noted that police arson investigators and National Bureau of Investigation officials are on the site to probe the cause of the explosion. Frederick Bragas of the OCD-RDCC 4-A said "forensic experts are now determining the identities of the fatalities."The Coast Guard reported yesterday that a cargo ship laden with cement sank overnight in the Philippines, killing the vessel's chief engineer. A passing ship rescued the 19 others, while a coast guard rescue boat itself required rescue in strong waves in the region after getting into difficulties before losing contact.MV Maria Lourdes, a 639-ton vessel, had been transporting 22,000 bags of cement from Iligan City in Lanao del Norte and was headed towards a town in Occidental Mindoro when the starboard main engine failed. While running on only the port main engine, strong waves battered the ship until shortly after 7:00 p.m. Tuesday night, when she went down at Antique. Chief engineer Alex Tambasin was drowned.The Coast Guard received word on the emergency at 7:03 p.m. from Candano Shipping Lines. Vessel 3504 was dispatched to aid the stricken ship, but the boat was also troubled by strong waves and eventually contact was lost. A passing ship rescued the survivors from the Maria Lourdes instead.Vessel 3504's crew were located on Sibay Island by the Philippine Air Force. The seven-man crew had abandoned the boat to rough seas and sought refuge on the island. They were rescued by helicopter on Wednesday morning.Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared a state of national calamity Sunday in the wake of Typhoon Durian, allowing the government to more rapidly release funds needed to bolster search and rescue efforts. Relief efforts in the Philippines faced delays Sunday for survivors, as fears grew of a rising death toll in the archipelago nation from last week's storm.Red Cross officials recorded a death toll of at least 406, with 398 others missing and another 489 as injured, based on figures provided by mayors of devastated towns in the eastern Philippines, where Durian hit with 139 mph winds and torrential rains on Thursday.Canada pledged $870,000 and the Netherlands Red Cross pledged $53,000 to help the country deal with the aftermath of the storm that triggered massive flooding and volcanic mudslides. The United States also promised an undetermined amount of aid. Many provinces lost power, making communication virtually impossible. In one of the worst hit provinces, Albay, two villages were buried by volcanic mudslides and volunteers were working to recover bodies from the wreckage.According to the Red Cross, rescue boats were used to survey the damage and take people to the 305 evacuation centers. The Red Cross estimated about 66,616 people were now homeless based upon the number of homes destroyed in the wake of Durian.Earlier, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said 38,473 displaced people were in evacuation shelters.The Philippines, still reeling from the destructive Typhoon Ketsana just days before, is bracing for another strike from Typhoon Parma, which is expected to hit the region on Saturday. Ketsana brought torrential rains to the northern Philippines on Saturday, inundating most of the capital Manila and surrounding provinces. Scores of people were killed and many are still missing. Overall, Ketsana affected nearly two million people.Now Parma, a "super typhoon" packing winds of 150 miles per hour, is threatening to devastate the region again. The storm could be more powerful than Ketsana: "We are dealing with a very strong typhoon (and) there is a big possibility that this typhoon will gather more strength," said Nathaniel Cruz, a forecaster in the Philippines.Officials are preparing evacuation plans, and refugees from the prior flooding were advised to remain in shelters and avoid returning to their homes.The thought of another disaster is unbearable for some residents. Glen Juban, who lost his 4 year-old daughter to Typhoon Ketsana, said, "I hope the typhoon will hit another place. We've been hit so hard. The situation now is just so difficult and I don't know if we can take some more, another calamity."Elnora Avarientos, World Vision's chief in the Philippines, was also concerned. "Families are now just starting to pick up what was left of their lives. Now, I'm afraid [...] Typhoon Parma would make it a lot harder for the affected families to cope and for the relief [...] agencies to respond," Avarientos said.Several new developments have occurred surrounding the loss of Philippine ferry MV Princess of the Stars, which capsized and sank on June 21 during a severe storm. The loss near Sibuyan island during Typhoon Fengshen, known locally as Frank, killed more than 800 of those on board.Ship owner Sulpicio Lines has sued Del Monte Philippines for failing to declare a cargo of the dangerous pesticide endosulfan that was on board. Sulpicio yesterday sued the Board of Marine Inquiry (BMO) for allegedly making comments contributing to negative publicity surrounding the line and asked a court to stop the body continuing its investigation, saying it no longer had any authority. Today, that request was denied.Another outcome of today's proceedings is a deadline for Sulpicio to recover the ship. The company has ninety days to ensure the recovery operation is complete.Yesterday, an eight-page complaint was filed against Del Monte at Manila City's regional trial court. It alleges that Del Monte violated the line's terms by failing to inform Sulpicio that the shipment included edosulfan. The line notes that any toxic cargo should have been declared. Suplicio is seeking PHP5.5 million from the company for alleged negligence."Due to Del Monte’s deceit and non-disclosure, plaintiff was led to believe that the subject shipment of Endosulfan was a regular cargo. Had defendant Del Monte disclosed the toxic nature of the cargo, plaintiff would not have loaded the same on board a passenger-cargo vessel, be it MV Princess of the Paradise or MV Princess of the Stars," said a statement by Suplicio.The exact total sought as damages is P549,661.11, which accounts for the correct rate for shipping if the toxic cargo had been declared, plus double rates as punitive measures. On top of those damages sought is P3 million to cover specialist recovery required for the chemical, P1 million in moral damges for lost corporate goodwill and damage to Sulpicio's reputation, P500,000 in moral damages for Sulpicio marketing vice president and shareholder Jordan L. Go, P200,000 in exemplary damages and P300,000 in legal costs.The discovery that the ship was carrying the endosulfan shipment, which totaled 10 metric tons, led to a ban on fishing in the nearby town of San Fernando and an emergency cessation of search and rescue activities, which were mostly being conducted by divers. The pesticide is banned in many countries and is subject to various regulations in the Philippines. Water samples from the wreck site show that thus far the pesticide has not leaked.A specialist joint team is set to arrive soon from the European Union and the United Nations Environmental Programme to assist with opearations relating to the pesticide, which is a neurotoxin.The Philippine Coast Guard yesterday awarded some 42 staff divers and six civilian volunteer divers for their work at the Princess of the Stars. They were particularly praised for being keen to return to work. They are awaiting the results of tests for exposure to endosulfan.Endosulfan is one of the items set for retrieval in a new deadline set by the government task force overseeing the disaster. Sulpicio must also recover the remaining bodies and the unused fuel on board within 90 days.Sulpicio had initially offered to have the job done in 164 days, but Transportation Undersecretary Elena Bautista rejected this proposal, saying "Out of humanitarian reasons, I told them not to prolong the agony of the victims' relatives all the way to Christmas." Sulpicio was given until Wednesday to name the salvage contractor who would be responsible for recovering the ship, after which they were to submit their retrieval plans to the International Maritime Organisation.Sulpicio was also given the option of simply towing the ship closer to shore to do the recovery instead of refloating it, which they have opted for. In Bautista's words: "Based on the Sulpicio report this morning, their plan now is to just tow the vessel to the shore, get the hazardous materials out, get the fuel out, and get the people out and I think that would be more cost-effective and most practical because that can be done, maybe within a month, as compared to refloating, which would probably take three months."Sulpicio is currently considering three different potential salvors, which remain unnamed. They have been told that the company needs to have expertise suitable enough to ensure marine life is not harmed and hazardous materials are not spilled. There is a possibility that the planned towing will damage nearby coral. It is already confirmed by the coastguard that oil onboard cannot leak. Most of the 250,000 litres of bunker fuel are in the service tank, which is considered safe. Only the small amount of oil in the base tank may leak but oil spill containment booms are already in place should this occur.The government has said that, had Sulpicio not made provisions to get the salvage done, then they would have performed the operation themselves. Had this occurred, Sulpicio would have been charged for it, with the bill estimated at P100 million.One aspect of another legal case was resolved today. Sulpicio had questioned the authority of the BMI to conduct investigations, instead saying only the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) had the right to do so, and pointing to a separate inquiry started by MARINA. However, a hearing today found that the BMI and MARINA serve different roles. The BMI's role is solely to determine the cause of marine accidents. MARINA's purpose is more concerned with regulations, and is mainly investigating the role of Sulpicio themselves. "We are looking at why we should not cancel the company’s franchise," explained MARINA Administrator Vicente Suazo Jr.Both investigations are ongoing.A powerful typhoon has killed dozens of people, affected over 28,000 people in the Philippines, and caused the evacuation of 21,190 people from south east China.The Philippines were hit by 175 kilometers per hour (kph) winds with gusts of up to 210 kph, as well as heavy rain which triggered flooding and landslides.Ten Philippine villages have been inundated by four and five feet deep flooding.  Thousands cling to tree tops and are stranded on roof tops awaiting rescue by helicopter.  Over 12,000 have been evacuated and over 1,000 are homeless.  Landslides have trapped Korean and Canadian mountaineers whose guide could not be rescued.  Landslides have closed highways and have caused traffic jams ten kilometers long.  Three French tourists and their two Filipino guides have been killed due to landslides on Mount Pinatubo.  Five miners remain missing after a landslide destroyed their living quarters.  Electricity is down in some areas of the Philippines resulting in a collapse in contact as radios and cellphones have not been re-charged.Botolan town hit by a flash flood has been declared as in a state of calamity.  School classes have been cancelled in various locations across the Philippines, and many city roads are not traversable due to flood waters.The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) has reported that over 28,629 people have been affected and of these 10% have been evacuated.On August 8, the typhoon is diminishing but still recording 150 kph winds with gusts reaching 185 kph according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).A capsized fishing boat off the coast of the province of Hainan has initiated search and rescue efforts for nine missing fishermen.  School classes have been suspended, boats called into port, and businesses closed in China's Fujian Province.  The provincial government used cell phone text messages to contact 8.4 million warning its residents of Morakot's approach to mainland China.Typhoons occur in the South China Sea every year between May and September.A photographer has died after being run over by a car in Los Angeles, California, United States. The man, who was attempting to photograph the vehicle of Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber, has not been formally identified by police but was named as Chris Guerra by local media.At approximately 17:45 PST Tuesday the driver of Bieber's white Ferrari car was pulled over by police for a speeding offence on Interstate 405, near to Getty Center Drive. Reports indicate Guerra — a freelance photojournalist — had been pursuing this vehicle throughout the day, based on the incorrect assumption that Bieber was in the vehicle when it was actually rapper Lil Twist driving the car with another passenger onboard. Entertainment news website TMZ understands the photographer stopped his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and attempted to take pictures of the police stop before crossing the road and continuing, prompting the California Highway Patrol police officer conducting the traffic stop to order him back across, twice. When he attempted to walk back across, he was struck by an oncoming vehicle.The photographer was transported to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he subsequently died. He was reportedly aged in his 20s. In a statement, Bieber said "[w]hile I was not present nor directly involved with this tragic accident, my thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim." According to police, the driver of the vehicle that hit the photographer is unlikely to face criminal charges.The incident has prompted Bieber to call for changes to laws surrounding the way in which members of the press work. "Hopefully this tragedy will finally inspire meaningful legislation and whatever other necessary steps to protect the lives and safety of celebrities, police officers, innocent public bystanders, and the photographers themselves", he said.PIA Flight 661 crashed into a mountainous region near Havelian, Pakistan today. None of those on board are thought to have survived.The Pakistan International Airlines domestic flight from Chitral was nearing its destination in Islamabad. PIA said the ATR-42 carried 42 passengers, five crewmembers, and one additional staff member. Dozens of bodies, many badly burned, have been recovered from the fiery wreckage.Local policeman Kurshid Tanoli said emergency vehicles can only reach Batolani, the nearest village. Personnel must then walk half an hour to the scene, he said.Debris is strewn for several kilometres across the Abbottabad region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Bodies are being recovered to Ayub Medical Teaching Hospital. The airline said the flight carried two Austrians and one Chinese national.Among those on board was Junaid Jamshed, a celebrated popstar who abandoned music in favour of preaching after joining Tableeghi Jamaat. Jamshed ran a nationally successful fashion business. His wife joined him on the flight. Osama Warraich, a senior civil servant in Chitral, was also on board.Passengers also included two infants.The aircraft, AP-BHO, was just under ten years old. PIA reported the aircraft encountered engine trouble at around 16:15 local time. After beginning a descent and declaring mayday, the plane lost control and turned left before crashing. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder  are in the Civil Aviation Authority's possession.Pakistani media has claimed the flight was operating with some known technical faults. The Aviation Herald reports receiving information to the contrary.Two medium intensity seisms were registered in Chile. These quakes are aftershocks of the March 11 Pichilemu earthquake. According to the University of Chile Geological Survey, the first one took place at 9:59 local time (13:59 UTC); its epicenter was located 17 kilometers northeast of Pichilemu, with a magnitude of 4.7. It lasted about ten seconds. The second aftershock had a magnitude of 5.1, and occurred at the 10:57 local time (14:57 UTC), with its epicenter located 15 kilometers north of Cobquecura.The National Emergencies Office graded the scale of the seisms on the Mercalli scale, which attempts to quantify the amount of physical damage caused by an earthquake. The intensities of the smaller aftershock were determined to be V in Pichilemu, III in Talca and II in San Fernando, while the larger 5.1 magnitude earthquake only hit IV in Pichilemu, but registered a IV in Talca as well, due to its closer proximity to that city.Thursday morning the Municipality of Pichilemu posted a letter via Facebook to all those affected by the February 27 and March 11 earthquakes in the surrounding areas of Pichilemu, like Ciruelos, Alto Ramírez, and others. However, they didn't name the village of Espinillo. The mayor of Pichilemu, Roberto Córdova, was criticized for not giving aid to the village. Córdova responded that he was "doing his best to aid [the surrounding areas]. [The Municipality] is going to replace the [balustrades] destroyed by the 11 March earthquake," and "these places are receiving the aid they require."Around 115 pilgrims were killed Sunday in a stampede in India's Madhya Pradesh region. Some 50,000 pilgrims were attempting to visit the Ratangarh temple as part of an annual Hindu festival. Sources indicate that rumors spread through the crowd that the bridge over the Sindh River could collapse, which caused widespread panic. The rumor provoked a stampede in which many people were trampled and others sought escape by jumping into the river, actions which resulted in many drownings. The death toll includes 30 children and may rise as bodies are recovered and patients in critical condition are monitored. "We have counted 100 bodies so far. Several pilgrims died on way to hospital. The toll may rise manifold," a senior police officer told The Times of India. At least another 100 people were injured during the incident. A traffic jam leading to the temple caused rescue vehicles and medical teams to be delayed. Stampedes are common during religious festivals in India. The bridge involved in this stampede has recently been rebuilt following a similar incident in 2007.In southern Afghanistan in the province of Ghazni, the 29-year old Dutch pilot Michael Donkervoort died when his F-16 fighter jet crashed."The plane was flying at a great height when the accident occurred, which means it can be ruled out that the craft was shot down. We therefore assume it was an accident," said the Dutch Defense Ministry.There has been an investigation launched into the cause of the crash, which was found by a team of rescuers from the United States.The jet was flying with another F-16 when it crashed.Investigators with Iran's Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) have concluded that pilot error was to blame for last month's crash of Aria Air Flight 1525. The Ilyushin Il-62 ran off the runway at Mashad and struck a wall while landing, killing 17 people and wounding 30.The CAO Flight Standards Department's deputy director Faramarz Sarvi stated that the aircraft had been traveling at excessive speed. Sarvi added that lack of crew cooperation was also suspected, but denied reports that the pilots had been arguing when the accident occurred. However, the Aviation Herald claims that the cockpit voice recorder showed they had been."Because of the high-speed, the pilot apparently lost control of the plane upon landing, causing it to veer off the runway," said Sarvi. He further stated that the crew did not answer warnings from the tower to slow down and that there was no equipment failure. Both aircraft and crew had passed safety checks prior to the plane taking off.Sarvi stated that around 4,200 hours of investigations were conducted.A Sukhoi Su-25 military jet has exploded in midair near Vladivostok, Russia, killing the pilot. The Russian Air Force said the plane was 140km (90 miles) from the port city on the Pacific coast.The plane, a single seat twinjet used to support ground forces, was on a training mission when the explosion occurred. Russia has grounded all their Su-25s while the crash is investigated by order of the air force's commander. The investigation will be conducted by a special commission of the Ministry of Defence.Colonel Alexander Drobyshevsky, spokesman for the Air Force, said "Today, on March 20 at 3:33 Moscow time (0:33 GMT), a Su-25 aircraft crashed during a training flight near the Chernigovka airbase, 143 kilometers from Vladivostok." The crash site is in mountainous terain, and the Far Eastern Union of Air Force and Air Defense's investigational commission has flown in and is on-site.Uncomfirmed reports suggest that immediately prior to the crash the pilot reported an engine fire, followed by a loss of contact. Interfax reports that an anonymous source involved with the investigation said "The head of flight control reported that he saw a flash under the fuselage of the strike plane. More than likely one of the weapons exploded."Drobyshevsky offered an alternative explanation. "According to preliminary reports, the plane developed technical problems during live firing exercises," he said.Marwoto Komar, pilot of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, a Boeing 737-400 which overshot the runway in Yogyakarta, Indonesia on March 7, killing 21, has spoken to the media for the first time about the accident. Five of the deceased were Australian."I am deeply, deeply mourning for the victims and for the Australians," Mr Komar told News Limited . A recent report found his actions to be chiefly responsible for the disaster, finding that he had ignored fifteen automated warnings that he was going too fast, and describing him as fixated with landing. As a result, he is likely to face criminal charges.Mr Komar broke down outside his Jakarta residence as he told reporters “I didn't plan for this to happen. The point is that I want people to know I am deeply in mourning and also that I understand what the families feel. I just did my job as normal, as usual, flying as a pilot.”Mr Komar is currently undergoing psychological treatment for mental problems caused by the crash. His flying license has been suspended. "Every day I am here at home, I have never run away. I have explained everything to the KNKT (Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee) and to the police," he said.Mr Komar said he couldn't comment on technical aspects of the crash, or of the criticisms of his conduct, as the matter is still under police investigation. He is likely to face negligence charges which carry a prison sentence if convicted.Three other Garuda employees are currently being questioned in Jakarta by police as part of the investigation. They've been told that they are being interrogated as "witnesses".Meanwhile, Emirsyah Satar, managing director of the airline, has announced an intention to resume flights to Europe next year, assuming success in a current bid to get the airline off the list of air carriers banned in the EU, where all Indonesian airlines were placed earlier this year. He suggested Amsterdam as the most likely destination.The pilot and co-pilot of Tuninter Flight 1153, which crashed into the Mediterranean Sea in 2005, killing sixteen people, have each received ten-year jail sentences for the ditching of the flight. They were found to have prayed instead of trying to direct the plane to safety when the engines failed. Tuninter Flight 1153, from Bari, Italy, to Djerba, Tunisia, crashed into Italian waters on August 6, 2005.The flight ran into trouble because the ATR 72 twin-engined turboprop had mistakenly been fitted with the fuel gauge for an ATR 42, which has a lower fuel capacity. The incorrect reading on the gauge was relied upon, and led to the aircraft suffering fuel starvation and eventually running out of fuel. The right engine failed at 23,000 feet, and the left at 7,000 feet.Captain Shafik Al Gharbi and co-pilot Ali Kebaier Lassoued were described as having panicked and started praying aloud, rather than following emergency procedures to bring the plane safely to a runway. After gliding for sixteen minutes, the pilots decided to attempt a crash-landing in the Mediterranean, and the aircraft crashed into the sea about 23 nautical miles to the Northwest of Palermo.The court in Palermo also sentenced five other employees of Tuninter to sentences of between eight and nine years' imprisonment. None of the accused were in court to hear the verdict, and none will serve time in jail before the appeals process is completed.No one was injured when one or more pipe bombs exploded outside the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Courthouse located in San Diego, California.The bomb exploded around 1:40 a.m. Sunday morning on May 4, 2008 and was reported by guards patrolling the building. Debris from the blast was found across the street in the AT&T building eight stories above the lobby of the courthouse. Doors were blown out along with several windows, but there was no other damage.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is investigating the incident and evidence has been sent to an FBI laboratory in Virginia for analysis.Video footage from surrounding cameras is being analyzed, but so far there are no suspects and no one has claimed responsibility for the blast. The courthouse did not receive any threats prior to the blast. Authorities swept the areas surrounding the courthouse, but no other explosive devices were found.The courthouse will remain closed today to repair the damage and for authorities to finish the investigation.The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona is currently locked down while security teams are doing a sweep of the area after a pipe bomb was found this morning.Arizona Public Service Company (APS) spokesman Jim MacDonald said a contract worker was stopped at the main gate of the facility for a routine security sweep and a suspicious looking device was reportedly found in the bed of the worker's pickup truck. APS owns the station, which is located in Wintersberg, Arizona. According to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO), the suspicious looking device was a pipe bomb."MCSO bomb squad tests later determined that the capped pipe was a credible explosive device," said APS in a written statement.The worker was taken into custody, and the entrance to the plant was immediately closed. The suspect, only described as a white male, lives in a Phoenix apartment complex, is reportedly an engineer who works with computers, and is cooperating with police. Three schools in the Saddle Mountain Unified School District were locked down voluntarily, affecting about 1,500 students.According to Fox News, the Department of Homeland Security's operations center was monitoring the incident.MacDonald said the plant nor the public are at risk, "We have a large and well-trained security force that followed the procedures exactly the way they're supposed to." The incident, which was classified as an "unusual event" -- the lowest emergency classification, is not believed to be terrorist related.The FBI and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department are investigating.The Palo Verde plant is about 35 miles west of Phoenix and is the largest nuclear electric generating site in the country, producing as much electricity as nine Hoover Dams.On Saturday, May 19, a ship chartered by the United Nations' (UN) World Food Programme (WFP), came under attack off the coast of Somalia after making a delivery in Merca.Two speedboats with armed guards were sent out to intercept the attack. One of these men was killed. The ship which was headed to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, did not fall into the hands of the pirates.Since the attack, WFP has suspended deliveries by ship. Shipping is the main and fastest way of getting food relief into Somalia. This comes just days after WFP announced that it was stepping up food deliveries."This attack underscores the growing problem of piracy off Somalia which, if unresolved, will sever the main artery of food assistance to the country – and to the people who rely on it for their survival," said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the WFP in a news release."Unless action is taken now, not only will our supply lines be cut, but also those of other aid agencies working in various parts of Somalia.""WFP is very saddened and alarmed by the death of the guard, who showed great courage while the ship came under attack. We send our sincere condolences to his family," she continued. "We urge key nations to do their utmost to address this plague of piracy, which is now threatening our ability to feed one million Somalis.""We are not taking any risks after being victims four times. We planned to go to Somali this week but following Saturday's incident our ship will not sail," said Karim Kudrat who owns MV Rozen, which was hijacked in February and released forty days later upon payment of ransom. The United States Navy's Maritime Liaison Office (MARLO) in Bahrain has issued a warning, advising all ships to stay at least 200 nautical miles (NM) off the coast of Somalia.This month alone, four ships have been hijacked by pirates and three of them are still being held. Two of the ships, South Korean fishing trawlers, were boarded some 210 NM off the coast, which is outside of Somalia's Exclusive Economic Zone. Scores of crewmembers remain hostages. The sailors are said to be from China, India, Vietnam and South Korea."Attacks have sprung up again because we believe there is no government in place to control the militants ... when the Islamists were in power there were no attacks," Cyrus Moday, a senior analyst at the International Maritime Bureau told Reuters.An anonymous maritime security expert told BBC News: "We have evidence that the pirates have a main contact in Puntland and it's up to the interim government in Somalia to track and arrest the contact for taking part in an illegal syndicate." “In the hope of enriching themselves, these pirates are very cruelly playing with the lives of the most vulnerable women and children who had to leave their homes because of fighting. We appeal to the Somali authorities to act to stop these pirates before they cause more misery both to the crews of hijacked ships and to the people who rely on WFP food for their survival,” Peter Goossens, director of WFP Somalia, said.Alleged pirates sometimes call themselves coast guards, claiming to protect Somali waters from polluters and illegal fishing.An outbreak of pneumonic plague has killed 61 people as of February 15 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).The deadly disease has struck in Ituri district, Oriental province, in the northern part of Congo. While 61 deaths have been confirmed, the total number of cases is not known.Samples have been taken from 40 patients and sent to laboratories in Kinshasa for analysis. So far, all the victims have been suffering from pneumonic plague, with no cases of bubonic plague detected.All the victims are workers at a diamond mine employing 7,000 people. The mine was re-opened on December 16 last year, and the first cases were reported four days later.Teams from Médecins sans Frontières, WHO, Medair and the Ministry of Health have gone to the region to assess the situation, while a multi-disciplinary team flew to the area yesterday. If access is possible, the team will assist in treatment, surveillance, and in the tracing of people who have possibly been exposed to the disease.Pneumonic plague is a highly infectious disease which has caused many epidemics and pandemics in history. Pneumonic plague differs from bubonic as it specifically infects the lungs.The infected lungs raise the possibility of person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is usually between two to four days, but can be as little as a few hours. The initial symptoms of headache, weakness, and coughing with hemoptysis are indistinguishable from other respiratory illnesses. Without diagnosis and treatment the infection can be fatal in one to six days; mortality in untreated cases may be as high as 95%. The disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics.It is primarily a disease of rodents. Human infection most often occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has previously fed on an infected rodent.Globally, the World Health Organization reports 1,000 to 3,000 human cases of plague every year.A Colombian passenger jet carrying 152 passengers and 8 crewmembers has crashed in Western Venezuela.

"It could have crashed into the side of a hill. It could be anywhere. This is difficult country," an unnamed rescue worker was quoted as saying by Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA). An unnamed airport official told Reuters that the plane had crashed into a mountain in Kampot Province, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) from the capital, Phnom Penh. "We heard there was something wrong with the plane at Kom Chhay mountain in Kampot," the official was quoted as saying.Earlier in the day, Royal Cambodian Armed Forces dispatched helicopters to search for the crash site, but visibility was poor because of rain.Deputy provincial police chief In Chiva told AFP that some conservationists working in the mountainous jungle near Kampot's Bokor Hill Station had seen the plane crash. "The area is heavily forested and the sky is dark [with rain] so it is hard for us to search. We have not found any pieces of the plane yet," he was quoted saying by AFP.The search is centered in Chhuk district, about 40 kilometers (24 miles) north of the provincial capital, Kampot governor Thach Khorn told DPA. "We are having serious difficulties reaching the wreck," he was quoted as saying. "We can do no more to get to the site by road tonight. However, we are doing everything we can to reach the area as soon as possible," Khorn added. The flight had 16 passengers – 13 South Koreans and three Czechs, plus a flight crew of one Russian and five Cambodians.PMTair is a small Cambodian airline with domestic and international routes, including direct flights from Seoul to Siem Reap, feeding a large influx of tourists from South Korea in the past few years. The airline had begun regularly scheduled Siem Reap-Sihanoukville flights in January, providing a direct link between the two popular tourist towns."We cannot find the plane right now, so we cannot say anything," an unnamed PMT official was quoted saying by AFP.The airline's website lists its current fleet as having two jets, a Boeing 737-200 and a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, and four prop-driven planes: two each of the Russian-made Antonov AN-24s and AN-12s.The airline has a checkered safety reputation. In 2005, a piece of landing gear snapped off an aging Antonov AN-24 on landing at Banlung, Ratanakiri, with 59 passengers aboard. There were no injuries, but the airline was temporarily grounded after the incident.Two planes carrying parachutists collided this morning in western Slovakia, near the Czech Republic. Of around 40 on board, seven are confirmed dead.The crash site near Červený Kameň is hard to access; rescuers are using helicopters.

The two boys were reported missing nearly a month ago.Police had shown photos of the two bodies to Parker's mother, Angela Virginia, who said she believed that the bodies were those of the two missing boys. Today's autopsy confirms their identities, and lists drowning as the cause of death. Police have said there is no evidence to suggest foul play. "Honestly I don't think there was any foul play. That makes it kind of nice for the family that they weren't held against their own will," said Dennis Frazier, Henning's uncle."It looks like it has been in the lagoon for quite some time," said Nan Hegerty, Chief of the Milwaukee Police, when the first body was found. According to Hegerty, two people walking in the park spotted the first body at around 7:23 p.m. CDT on Friday. The second body was found at about 10 p.m. CDT by divers for the police department. Both boys were fully clothed when found. According to Hegerty, the pond where the bodies were found had been checked several times in the past."Apparently that body too had come up to the surface and was caught in a somewhat of a weedy, wooded area of the lagoon," added Hegerty.Both boys had been missing since March 19, 2006.Some of the eight tourist fatalities involved in a bus hijacking in the Philippines in August may have inadvertently been shot by police during a raid on the vehicle, authorities investigating the incident have said. Philippine justice secretary Leila de Lima told Sky News that bullet trajectories and wounds received by the hostages indicate that some of the eight were killed by “friendly fire”. She did not confirm, however, that the wounds inflicted by police bullets were the ones which led to the deaths of the hostages. "There is a big possibility that there [was] friendly fire," she said. "We are not focusing on [the possibility], but we should never miss that. Otherwise our report will be less than thorough." Police have insisted that all the fatal wounds were inflicted by the hostage taker’s gun. They maintain that other bullets, fired at the bus by police snipers and an assault unit, did not lead to the deaths of the tourists.The incident occurred when a former Filipino policeman kept tourists from Hong Kong, China, hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists, before being gunned down and killed after an eleven-hour standoff with police.Although President Benigno Aquino III warned against people coming to conclusions regarding the operation before an investigation has been carried out, he also pledged that anyone found by the investigators to have failed in their duties would have criminal charges filed against them. "Our government is now focused on taking the necessary steps to prevent this tragedy from ever happening again," said Aquino during a live interview on national television. "Let me just say that this incident will not define this administration." The report is expected to be released on September 15. De Lima, who is heading up the inquiry, added that forensic examinations on a number of the dead tourists did not match the statement made by the bus driver, who claimed that the gunman shot them at close range. "What is crucial, occupying our minds, is if the shots were made at close range, [these] are not consistent with forensic findings," she said. De Lima states that the entry points of the wounds did not show burn marks that would have been caused by the muzzle of a gun being shot from close range. She added that it was possible that other units deployed around the bus may have fired on it. China criticized the rescue operation, stating that the Philippine police force who carried out the raid were poorly trained and under-equipped to handle the situation.Aquino says he makes himself personally responsible for the incident, which according to the Associated Free Press has "chilled ties with Hong Kong and damaged the Philippine tourism industry." He added that he intends to form an elite unit to engage in a similar incident, which would consist of 200 and 400 soldiers and police officers who are capable of responding to any threats or incidents that occur in the country.Mendoza was reportedly taking revenge for having been fired from the from the Police Force after claims of robbery and the use of drugs were made against him. His brother explained that "his problem was he was unjustly removed from service. There was no due process, no hearing, no complaint." Both government officials and his brother had tried to negotiate with him to release the hostages.The Metropolitan Police Service has confirmed that a police officer and a police community support officer were stabbed in the west of London, England. The officers were stabbed at a bus stop in the Ealing Broadway region of the city about 1505 UTC while examining bus tickets. The man stabbed the two in an attempt to evade arrest. The pair were subsequently transported to hospital by ambulance. The police community support officer was seriously injured, having been stabbed in the arms. However, he was not thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries. The police officer was stabbed in the neck. His injuries were considered life-threatening.The alleged attacker, a 30-year-old male, was arrested at the scene of the attack. According to reports, he was wanted by the police for recall to prison. When it became clear that he was going to be arrested, he drew a knife and stabbed the two.Koon Midam, a witness to this incident, commented: "The man was asked to show a valid ticket and went into a violent rage. Very quickly the problem escalated as he drew his knife and made a few quick slashes. It was more of a shock for the first few moments and then there were the cries, the Pc dropping to the floor and the man lashing out again."Another male witness described the events. "I could see two policemen sprinting to the back of a police car to retrieve a green first aid kit," he said. "They rushed back to assist a policeman who had blood on him. I then noticed another policeman who was walking slowly and then collapsed on the pavement. His arm fell to his side. As I drove away I also noticed a number of policemen pinning a man to the ground. He was shouting. What disturbed me most of all was the amount of blood on the pavement, it was clear that someone was very seriously injured."Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, has uploaded a message to the social networking website Twitter regarding this incident. In the tweet, Johnson states: "Shocked by the stabbing of a police officer & a PCSO in Ealing. No place for this on the streets of London".Police officials have retrieved the body of an American tourist who plunged to his death moments after stepping out of a helicopter while hunting in the Southern Alps, New Zealand.57-year-old Clifford Wayne Senter, of New Hampshire in the US, died when he slipped on wet ground while exiting the helicopter, and plunged down a steep bluff near Lois Peak in Mount Aspiring National Park. He had been hunting chamois at the time. Low cloud and fog has prevented search and rescue teams from reaching him on Monday night but a recovery team was deployed early Tuesday. The team found Mr Senter's body at the base of the bluff in the afternoon.Police said that Mr Senter had been in New Zealand for a week on a hunting holiday, with his wife and two friends.A police station has been hit by a bomb in Naciria, which is in the northern part of Algeria and is about 50 km east of the Algerian capital Algiers.According to reports, at least 4 people are dead and several are injured. Full details have not yet been released. The bomb went off at about 0600 UTC (7 AM local time) today.It is currently not clear whether the bombing was caused by a car bomb or a suicide attack.The bombing, although less serious than the December bombings which killed 40 people, is likely to raise suspicions that violence has not ended in Algeria. It is the first bombing to hit Algeria since the bombings in early December.The bombing was announced in a statement by a spokesman for the Algerian Interior Ministry in which the following was said - "There has been an attack with explosives near a police station in Naciria. The attack left three dead and seven wounded." Frequent terrorism first hit Algeria after measures were carried out by the government to stop a Muslim fundamentalist party winning the elections. That party has now been banned. A witness of the event said that the majority of injuries hit police officers and not the general public.Methane gas was blamed for the explosion deaths of 8 miners in southern Polish's Halemba coal mine Tuesday, November 21. Officials say at least 15 are missing. Rescue efforts were halted because dangerously high levels of methane gas returned, according to Zbigniew Madej, spokesman for state-owned Coal Co., which operates the mine. The missing miners' locater devices were not emitting signals, increasing rescurers' concerns for their well-being. Grzegorz Pawlaszek, head of Coal Co., said the 15 missing miners' fate is "not known," but added that "there is a chance to find someone still alive." “This is a tragedy. People have died here,” Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said when he came to Ruda Slaska to see the blast.Earlier Wednesday, a reconnaissance rescue team descended 3000 feet toward the blast scene, only to retreat because of safety concerns related to high methane gas levels. Rescue digging efforts were also halted because of explosion concerns. The missing men were aged 21-59. One of the miner's family members, Andrzej Pytlik, 30, remained on scene with his sister, hoping and waiting for news of her husband, Krystian Gaszka. Pytlik, also a miner, said through teary eyes that, "I work in the mines and I know that hope is scant because that's the truth."   The explosion occurred in a closed portion of the mine where the now-missing miners were working to retrieve abandoned equipment. According to Pawlaszek, the value of the equipment was $23 million, adding that "It was new equipment and that is why we decided to retrieve it." He indicated that the recovery work was performed under the supervision of gas detection specialists, and that the bodies of the recovered miners were difficult to identify because of the severity of burns and because their ID tags were blown away in the explosion. The Halemba mine, located in Ruda Slaska, has produced coal for nearly 50 years, has been fraught with safety concerns and has a track record of serious accidents. One of the oldest mines in Poland, it is centrally located in the industrial Silesia region. Earlier this year, a miner was trapped underground in the Halemba mine five days after a cave-in. In 1990, 19 miners were killed and 20 hurt in a gas explosion, and five were killed in collapse in 1991. Inside, priests and mining officials were comforting and counseling with distraught relatives. Outside, eight white candles flickered on a main gate wall.A bus carrying 50 Polish people (47 pilgrims and a three person crew) crashed today near Grenoble in France.

The crash is said to be the world's worst aviation disaster since 2001.A volcano alert has been issued after a moderate 2.8 magnitude earthquake occurred at Mount Ruapehu last night at 10.30 p.m. (NZDT). The quake also broke the Crater Lake cable which generated a call-out from the lahar response team.The New Zealand Department of Conservation has issued a high risk warning for the crater at Mount Ruapehu and Dave Wakelin, community relations officer for Tongariro-Taupo, said: "The warning was issued Thursday morning, in case more volcanic activity follows."It is yet to be confirmed if there was an eruption, as poor weather made it hard to see the crater from plane. Craig Miller, vulcanologist for Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS Science), said: "I had hoped to see if the lake was surrounded by blackened snow. All we could see was cloud." Steve Sherburn, duty vulcanologist for GNS Science, said: "The cause of the alert would remain uncertain until the weather cleared and there could be a proper examination. Part of the DOC lahar monitoring system appears to have been damaged at the time of the earthquake which suggests there may have been an eruption, but other monitoring data says that any eruption must have been relatively small." If there was an eruption it was probably only a small one.The alert level is remaining at one, which means there are signs of volcanic unrest.Monitoring of Mount Ruapehu will continue.This was the first reported call-out since 1995.A huge power outage occurred in Moscow today. The failure in the accumulative power supply system in Mosenergo which occurred at 11:15 a.m. local time on Wednesday, led to a power outage in all areas of the city.Power for lights failed in apartment buildings. Some lines of the Moscow underground stopped for four hours. Trams and trolley buses, electric trains of the Moscow railway also stopped. Hundreds of people were trapped in apartment building lifts. In addition to lighting problems, the homeowners have also lost their water supply, as pumping stations in Mosvodokanal also lost power because of the failure.  15 big cities and five areas of Moscow suburbs, some areas of the Tula and Kaluga areas were left without electricity. At 12:00 noon, food shops in the affected areas started closing. In shops where sellers continued trading, huge queues accumulated.To avoid panic at train stations, workers with megaphones informed passengers of train movements. At train stations, reserve power supplies are being used. According to eyewitnesses, there was no electric lighting at many stations and in transitions between them. Escalators also did not work.Thursday, May 26, 2005 Thursday morning trolley buses and trams still do not work in southern areas of Moscow. Despite repair work conducted during the night, it was impossible to power all trolleybus and tram lines.In total 8 tram and 25 trolleybus routes do not work. Buses will take over those routes. Besides this, in the south of Moscow there are still many disconnected apartment houses.All stations of the Moscow underground are working normally. All trains are running on schedule.The entrance to Moscow for supersize automobiles will be limited up to 14 o'clock in the afternoon. The limitation was put in place yesterday because of difficult road conditions in the city after the power failure.A power line to the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant in Japan was completed Thursday, which will allow cooling systems at one of the facility's reactors.The new line, roughly one kilometer (0.6 miles) in length, connects the power grid to the power plant's second reactor. It was completed at about 1730 local time (0830 UTC) on Thursday, and will be energized once spraying of seawater over reactor three is complete.According to a Tokyo Electric Power Company spokesperson, once the power line is energized "we will be able to activate various electric pumps and pour water into reactors and pools for spent nuclear fuel," thus cooling temperatures within the reactor.The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that the stricken power plant is currently stable, though there is still the chance of matters growing worse. An official at the agency said that "it's reasonably stable at the moment compared to yesterday."Pichilemu, Chile — A power outage affected many areas of Chile this evening. It is presumed to have been caused by a fault in the Chilean Sistema Interconectado Central (Central Interconnected System). Power was cut off between the Antofagasta Region and Los Lagos Region, including cities like Santiago, Valparaíso, La Serena, Pichilemu and Talca, at 20:50 (23:50 UTC). After twenty minutes, power was restored in some parts of Providencia.It surprised the people that were in shopping centers and in massive events, like the game between Deportes La Serena and Audax Italiano, which was cancelled, and the solidarity concert "Rock por Chile" ("Rock for Chile") that was being performed in Santiago's Movistar Arena. The outage also interrupted the Chilean Subway; personnel are currently evacuating users.The communications manager of Chilectra, the Chilean main power provider, reported to TVN that the power is coming back slowly to the Metropolitan Region. "We don't know exactly what happened. We are not receiving power in the distribution network in Santiago. The power is coming back, but is probable that in the outlying areas will be more difficult. [...] After the earthquake we did the corresponding fixes, so we don't know if this is related to the earthquake directly," Larraín said.The Presidency General Clerk Minister, Cristián Larroulet said, as reported by El Mercurio, that the power was going to be restored in around three hours. "Effectively there's an outage from Taltal until Los Lagos, probably because of the debility of the lines because of the earthquakes [...] It is another consequence of the earthquake that affected our country," he added.The Interior Minister, Rodrigo Hinzpeter, as reported by El Mercurio at 22:20 local time (01:20 UTC), informed from the ONEMI that the outage that affected many areas of Chile was produced by a failure in a 500 kilowatts transformer from Charrúa-Temuco, that caused a major fault in the Central Interconnected System. According to Clemente Pérez, Santiago's Metro chief executive, Santiago's subway was going to work normally today if the power service remains stable. The Central Interconnected System chief executive, Eduardo Ricke Muñoz, estimated at 22:44 local time (01:44 UTC) that the power service was going to be rerun in all the affected areas in the following two hours. It was later reported by El Mercurio that the failed transformer was located near Los Ángeles, in the Bío Bío Region.At 23:54 local time (02:54 UTC), Rodrigo Hinzpeter said: "We still cannot rerun the power service in the Bío Bío region, but we are doing our best and we hope to restablish it in the next few hours".At 00:30 local time (03:30 UTC), ONEMI reported that the power was restored in an 88 per cent. They detailed by region:In the Antofagasta Region, the power in Taltal was restored.In the Atacama Region, the power was restored totally.In the Coquimbo Region, 98% of power has been restored.In the Valparaíso Region, the power was restored totally.In the Metropolitan Region, the power was restored totally.In the O'Higgins Region, the power was rerun completely.In the Maule Region, the power was completely restored.In the Bío Bío Region, power has not been restored (0%).In the Araucanía Region, 90% of the power supply has been restored.In the Los Ríos Region, the power was completely restored.In the Los Lagos Region, 90% of the power supply has been restored.At 01:28 local time (04:28 UTC), Rodrigo Hinzpeter, the Interior Minister, informed via his Twitter account (@rhinzpeter), that the 93% of the power supply was rerun. The State Clerk also warranted that in Concepción, the power was restored in a 40%.Later, ONEMI ratified the information that Hinzpeter provided, and detailed the power recovering region by region, and the regions that have changed their percentage are:The Coquimbo Region, the power was restored in a 98%.In the Bío Bío Region, the power has been restored in a 40%. San Pedro de La Paz, Coronel, Lota, Tomé and Penco have the power rerun. Arauco, Lebu and Talcahuano still don't have power.The Los Lagos Region, has the power restored completely.A power outage at Japan's Fukushima 1 nuclear plant on Tuesday has seen eight water transfer pumps shut down, hindering efforts to collect leaked radioactive water before it can reach the sea.Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which runs the plant, said the affected pumps pull radioactive water out of a drainage channel, sending it through another channel to an enclosed artificial bay. This transfer began on April 17, following an official report released in February by TEPCO, revealing high concentration of radioactive materials found in the plant's drainage water.This latest news from the nuclear plant, which sits on the eastern edge of the island nation, alongside the North Pacific Ocean, comes four years after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, on March 12, 2011. This disaster saw the nuclear plant subjected to the combined force of an earthquake and tsunami, which caused an explosion at the plant. Since then, the site has remained unstable.The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found small amounts of radioactive caesium isotopes along the coast of North America, reported early this month. Along with these caesium substances, TEPCO reports indicate up to 10 trillion becquerels of strontium-90 and 40 trillion becquerels of tritium have contaminated sea water as a result of, and in the aftermath of, the 2011 disaster.On Saturday at 8:45 p.m. (CST), a power outage due to equipment failure at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri trapped 40 people in the two arch trams and 100 people in the observation center at the top of the Arch.It took about two hours to evacuate the south tram after one of the nine cables supporting the tram car possibly snapped because of a power failure. The north side tram and people in the observation center had to walk down approximately 300 feet of steps to a freight elevator to be taken to the bottom of the Arch. They were met by anxious families who had been waiting for hours outside the Arch. Two people needed treatment for minor injuries.The Gateway Arch will be back open Sunday with only the north tram operating. The National Park Service opened the Gateway Arch in 1966 and is one of the region's most popular attractions.Afghan government officials have said that a powerful suicide car bomb hit near the Indian Embassy in Kabul on Thursday, killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 80 others. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, saying their target was the embassy.The Afghan Interior Ministry says the explosion killed mostly civilians on the heavily guarded road between its headquarters and the Indian Embassy.Eyewitnesses reports said that the the blast was very powerful, shattering shop windows, filling the air with dust and scattering debris all along the road.General Sayed Abdul Ghafar Sahibzada, the Kabul police chief,  said the suicide bomber exploded his vehicle in the center of the capital. Some of the victims include police officers, he said.Thursday's blast comes one day after the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion into Afghanistan to topple the Taliban government.Last year, a similar attack by a Taliban suicide car bomber killed about 60 people near the Indian embassy. It was the deadliest assault in the capital since 2001.KYUSHU, Japan —A powerful magnitude 7 earthquake rocked Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu at 10:53 am local time today (0153 UTC), prompting the Japanese Meteorological Agency to issue tsunami warnings for the area. The tsunami warnings were canceled later in the day.A 75-year-old woman was killed in Fukuoka city by a falling wall. At least 400 people were injured by the quake. Local Fukuoka Airport and high speed bullet trains in the area temporarily suspended operations to look for damage.According to the agency, the epicenter of the earthquake was in shallow water in the Sea of Japan, off the north coast of Fukuoka Prefecture.Small aftershocks continued throughout the day, with authorities advising that residents should be prepared for aftershocks of up to magnitude 6.In the aftermath of the quake, people were quickly alerted to the state of the situation by television reports, telephone, and text-messaging systems.Interviewed by telephone in Hitoyoshi, well inland from the epicenter of the quake, a local resident noted the severity of the quake was frightening, and left the elderly woman unable to remain seated on a chair. Shutting off gas was the first priority, with the local television coverage providing a quick status update for the situation, followed by an interruption by national emergency network coverage.A foreign resident of Fukuoka city reported taking refuge under his desk for several minutes as books and ornaments fell from shelves. He prepared to evacuate to high ground in case of a tsunami, but news reports indicated little danger from a tsunami. He also reported that Japanese residents appeared unconcerned by the quake, with many strolling near Momochi beach shortly after the quake, showing little apparent concern.In Tenjin, downtown Fukuoka, Fukuoka Building's windows shattered, and the block was quickly cordoned off.  In addition to Fukuoka Building, many other buildings and businesses remained closed to shoppers.Wikinews contributor Oarih reports that a festive atmosphere pervaded the streets, however, as employees from Nishinihon Shimbun (a major Japanese newspaper) passed out one-page articles on the earthquake and curious onlookers investigated the damaged buildings and sidewalks.  Many residents, relieved by the relatively low damage inflicted by the earthquake, started visiting pubs and restaurants at lunch for a celebratory beer. With train and subway services disrupted, queues over 100 people long formed at some Nishitetsu bus stops in Tenjin as dusk approached.The penetration of modern text-messaging by the Japanese Keitai, the common Japanese cell phone system more prevalent than computer-based email, led to quick status checks on many family members located near the coast around Fukuoka, close to the quake's epicentre.  Wikinews contributor Oarih reports that cell phone service providers were swamped by the spike in use, however, and both voice and text services remained unreliable for much of the day.A massive explosion in the centre of Czech capital Prague has injured 35 or more people this morning. The blast occurred just before 10am local time in a building on Divadelní Street. Spokesman for local authorities Tomas Hulan says it is uncertain what caused the detonation but a natural gas leak is suspected. "A gas blast seems to be the most likely cause", he said. "The explosion was rather massive and damaged windows in several streets".The blast shattered windows of buildings in the area, including the National Theatre. Police have sealed off the area and are currently searching for people they believe may be trapped beneath the rubble. Zdeněk Schwarz, head of the Prague rescue service, said rescue workers had not yet been able to enter the building where the explosion occurred to search for missing people and determine any further gas leaks.Two stud bolts of the Sikorsky helicopter that crashed recently off the coast of Canada broke causing first a loss in oil pressure followed by a deadly crash landing on Thursday March 12, 2009 killing 17 of 18 people on board."I can safely say now that the stud broke in flight and the loss of oil pressure was a result of that," Mike Cunningham, the Transportation Safety Board  (TSB) of Canada's lead investigator said, "So far, we cannot find any other anomaly that would account for that loss of oil pressure. There is further analysis and work to be done on exactly how and why that stud broke."Upon examination of the wreckage and seats, it was determined the helicopter landed at an acceleration of about 20g. On impact windows and doors flew off.  It is not known at this time whether the victims drowned or were killed in this violent impact."It was [...] belly first in an upright position with a tail low attitude. That's what the damage is telling us," Allan Chaulk, a TSB investigator, "We are just scratching the surface of analyzing the data we've so far collected." The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did issue a directive to replace the titanium studs to steel studs before any Sikorsky S92 helicopters can resume flights. So far about 30% of helicopters worldwide still need to make the update.  Sikorsky had issued an Alert Service Bulletin to helicopter operators in January to replace the studs by 1,250 flight hours or within the year. A S-92A flight in Australia prompted the alert when it lost oil pressure and needed to make an emergency landing.During the examination of the wreckage, TSB investigators are uncertain why two of three aircraft flotation devices did not activate to keep the aircraft from sinking. The cockpit voice and flight data recorders were operational between cruising altitude of 9,000 feet and the descent to 800 feet, and then an unexplainable electrical malfunction caused them to cease operating.A preliminary report has been released into the disastrous crash of Spanair Flight 5022 in Madrid, Spain on August 20, which killed 154. The report confirms an earlier leaked finding that the wing flaps failed and no warning sounded to alert the pilots.The MD-82 was headed from Barajas airport to the Canary Islands. Video footage from airport security cameras shows the airliner travelling across an unusually long distance of runway before take-off. It failed to maintain altitude and quickly dropped back down at the runway's end, before bursting into a fireball. Just eighteen people survived the accident.The report confirms that the aircraft failed to get beyond forty feet off the ground before entering a stall and crashing. The tail of the jet struck the ground first, and the Spanish Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC)'s report also notes that the aircraft was carrying 10,130 litres (2,673 gallons) of fuel.The wing flaps were "fully retracted" at "0 degrees" according to the 12-page report, which also notes that the cockpit voice recorder indicates a complete failure of the take-off warning system (TOWS) - which is supposed to alert pilots attempting to take off in a plane that is not properly configured - to sound prior to the failed ascent. Spanair checks the TOWS each day and after every change in flight crew, but neither of these occurred between the accident flight and the flight before.It is not known when the CIAIAC's final report will be ready, but estimates vary from a few months to two years. The latest report notes "The investigation continues. It will be necessary to carry out tests and an exhaustive examination of the recovered parts of the plane." A separate judicial investigation also continues.A preliminary report by the Danish civil aviation authority, SLV, has shed light on the events leading up to a Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) airliner experiencing a landing gear failure upon landing in Denmark, one of two similar crashes that have resulted in the grounding of more than 60 of the model in question across the world.The aircraft, a Bombardier Q400 (alternatively known as a de Havilland Canada Dash 8), crashed due to a landing gear failure after a nut worked loose, due in turn to rusting on the threads of its bolt, according to the SLV's aircraft accident investigation committee report on Scandinavian Airlines Flight 1209. The nut and bolt were vital to the locking mechanism for the starboard landing gear, and consequently the structure collapsed.The SLV does not specifically address why this occurred, but according to SLV spokesman Thorbjoern Ancker the problem is a design flaw, and not a maintenance issue as previously suspected. In his own words, 'All speculation that this was an error by SAS is now shown to be wrong... It's a constructional weakness.' He explained that Bombardier maintenance documents supplied with the aircraft did not require maintenance personnel to inspect the bolt in question, and that accordingly this had not been done.Pending completion of landing gear inspections by SAS, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish authorities will make a decision regarding whether the air carrier's Q400 fleet should remain grounded, or be permitted to resume operations.A spokesman for Bombardier refused to comment on the findings when contacted by reporters, preferring instead to wait until the publication of the final report into the accident. He did, however, make one comment regarding speculation that SAS would be compensated if the accident was proven to be the responsibility of the supplier, saying, "That will be part of the discussions between Bombardier and airlines."Scandinavian Airlines have canceled 111 flights today as their Q400s are grounded per Air Transport Canada orders, while SAS have concealed 110 flights today and tomorrow while their aircraft are grounded. Bombardier have circulated a document to all operators of the type, containing advice recommending a revised inspection program.Shares in Bombardier fell 14 cents, or 2.2%, to CA$6.21 and most recent reports have them at $6.25. The company is therefore currently valued at $11 billion. Goodrich, who manufactured the equipment, fell 9 cents, or 0.1%, to US$65.11. SAS, who own Scandinavian Airlines, fell 2.25 kronor, or 1.9%, to 115.75 kronor. A continuing fall in SAS shares prices over the last six weeks has almost negated all gains this year.President George W. Bush made a stop over in two of the worst hit cities by Hurricane Katrina today. His stops included New Orleans, Louisiana, and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.The president made small speeches in both cities, with references to the many problems that still exist  due to a lack of housing, the slow pace of Small Business Administration Loans, problems with homeowners insurance payments and the urgent need for bridge rebuilding."People in faraway places like Washington, D.C., still hear you and care about you," Bush said standing in a gymnasium at St. Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis. "I recognize there's some rough spots. We're going to work to make them as smooth as possible."Bush also recognized and promised that his administration is learning the lessons of its "all-to-slow" and "much-criticized" response to Katrina. "Obviously the federal response in parts of this devastated area could have been a lot better. We want to know how to make them better. We want to make sure that when there is a catastrophe of any kind, this government, at the federal level, is capable of dealing with it in conjunction with the state and local governments.We want to know how to make it better," Bush said during his speech. "I just want to assure you, we are, we are."Bush went on to praise the city's success in getting the essential utilities, such as, water and electric "mostly" on-line. He also said that federal tax incentives will encourage businesses to create jobs and promised that the new levy system will make the city "both safer and more attractive for investment." He also added that all those things will help New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf, back into a "shining part of the South." He also said "New Orleans is a great place to have a convention" and a "heck of a place to bring your family."Bush promises that the federal government has allocated 85 billion dollars for reconstruction efforts, $25 billion of which has already been spent on mostly the effort to clean up the debris and provide temporary housing for citizens.Hurricane Katrina struck the south central U.S. on late August 29, 2005. Katrina first made landfall in Miami, Florida on August 25, 2005 as a category one hurricane resulting in dozens of deaths in South Florida and spawning several tornadoes. Katrina then passed over Florida and headed into the Gulf of Mexico where it strengthened into a massive category 5 storm.She then made her second landfall on the morning of August 29, 2005, near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana with winds at 125 MPH and a central pressure of 920 mbar, a strong Category 3 storm.Katrina is quite possibly the strongest hurricane on record ever, but estimating the size of storms from before the 1960s (the pre-satellite era) is difficult to near impossible.As of January 4, 2006, the confirmed death toll from Katrina stands at 1,386.Demographers estimate of New Orleans' 400,000 residents prior to Katrina only 25% have returned.British Prime Minister Tony Blair has made a statement at 10 Downing Street saying that the explosions in London today were "to scare people and to frighten them, to make them anxious and worried".He broke off his meeting with Australian Prime Minister John Howard to make the statement, with Howard alongside him.Blair went on to say how the "police have done their very best, and the security services too, in the situation, and I think we have just got to react calmly and continue with our business as much as possible as normal".London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair also released a statement urging Londoners to "get moving again", stating that the sites of the four explosions were secure and the situation was under control.Three tube lines remain closed: the Victoria, Northern and Hammersmith & City Lines. The Bakerloo line is suspended between Paddington to Piccadilly Circus. Replacement shuttle bus services are running.Police are appealing to anyone who may have photos or mobile phone images from any of the incident scenes, either at the time of the incident or shortly before, to send them online to: www.police.uk.A judge has issued a ruling in the 1998 bombing in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh. Defendant Sean Hoey, who faced 56 charges relating to a car bomb that killed 29 people and injured more than 200, has been found not guilty. A stunned silence in the public gallery of Belfast Crown Court greeted the verdict in the worst bombing during three decades of so-called troubles in Northern Ireland. Electrician Sean Hoey, 38, was accused of being the principle bomb-maker in a group of conspirators. Only one other person was charged in the case and he is awaiting retrial after having his conviction overturned.Hoey was said to have been among those who broke away from the Irish Republican Army months after the Good Friday Peace Agreement was negotiated.In summing up, Judge Reginald Weir said he was critical of forensic evidence presented by the prosecution that relied heavily on a new kind of DNA testing. He also criticized the police for how they handled and stored the evidence, with possible cross-contamination.  The judge also singled out two police officers who he said had exaggerated in order to gain a conviction.For families of the victims, it was a disappointment after waiting nearly a decade for justice. Lawrence Rush lost his wife in the blast. He was in the courthouse when the decision was announced."It is devastating," he said. "It is a disaster the way that this investigation was held, and I can say no more about it. All I know is that I am tired, you know, and I am exhausted. It has been a long corridor, 10 years of pain and hope."The legal system is here to protect human rights," said Victor Barker, who lost his son in the attack. "It is here to protect Sean Hoey's human rights. I am a lawyer, I believe in the system. Sometimes I find it hard to live with, but I must stand by it because that is the system of justice which ordinary decent people in this country live by. It is only a great shame that my son and the 29 people that died in Omagh had no human right at all."Families of those killed are now calling for a full public inquiry into the bombing. It is also possible that a civil case may be pursued next year.Police earlier released a statement reporting that a private helicopter carrying several people had vanished following the Champions League football semi-final between Liverpool and Chelsea at Anfield stadium.The helicopter left Liverpool's John Lennon Airport on Tuesday night at around 11pm, and was heading for a private landing site near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire when it vanished.  It is believed to have left radar screens at around 12.30am.A police spokeswoman said: "Details are sketchy at the moment.  The helicopter, we believe, had about four or five people on board and was a twin-engine Twin Squirrel.  It left John Lennon Airport in Liverpool at about 11pm and was on its way to a private address near Peterborough.  It appears to have disappeared off the radar. At the moment we are trying to find out more. The best case scenario is that it has made an emergency landing somewhere."The wreckage of the helicopter was found in woodlands near Wansford, in Cambridgeshire.  The pilot has been named as Stephen Holdich, co-owner of operating company Atlas Helicopters.Also on board were Jonathan Waller and Phillip Carter, as well as other people yet to be named.  It is believed one of the others on board was Mr Carter's teenage son, Andrew.  It has been released that the people found on board are deceased.  In 1996 Chelsea vice chairman Matthew Harding was killed when his helicopter, also a Twin Squirrel, crashed while returning from a match against Bolton Wanderers.Media reports indicate Brian Loncar, a prominent attorney based in Dallas, Texas was found unresponsive in a car outside his office Sunday morning.Loncar was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later. He was found in the front seat of his Rolls Royce Wraith. Loncar's death occurred just two days following his teenage daughter's memorial service. His daughter took her own life in late November.Police are still investigating Loncar's cause of death.  Medical personnel surmised heart attack was the likely cause, according to Loncar's son.  In 2008 Loncar's car was struck by a fire-rescue truck, seriously injuring him.Loncar maintained eleven law offices stretching across Texas and his TV commercials featured an illustrated 'strong arm' pounding against steel, promising potential clients he'd help them gain compensation if they'd been injured in an accident. The law firm's web site indicates they specialize in all types of vehicle accidents and various types of wrongful death cases.A Proton rocket which was intended to launch the JCSAT-11 satellite into a geostationary transfer orbit lifted off and successfully completed its first stage burn, but the second stage failed leading to loss of the rocket and satellite.The launch vehicle was a Proton M booster with a Breeze M upper stage. More than 300 Proton rockets have been launched, all from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Following the launch failure, Kazakhstan suspended the launch of Proton rockets from Baikonur, Interfax news agency reported.JSAT Corporation immediately placed an order with Lockheed Martin, the satellite manufacturer, for an identical replacement satellite based on the A2100AX design.The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation yesterday released 600 pages of the 2,000 page final report into the Jokela school shooting. 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen opened fire at Jokela High School, killing eight before turning his gun on himself, receiving fatal wounds.The remaining 1,400 pages of the report are to remain confidential. The public section reveals a number of problems that may have impacted on Auvinen's decision to conduct the attack, but says that police failed to find any conclusive motive. Also released was an animation depicting events at the school.The report says Auvinen had been bullied since the age of ten and concludes the extent of this problem was greater than previously thought. Auvinen suffered from anxiety and blushing, especially in lessons, and had been diagnosed with a panic disorder, for which he had been prescribed medication. Auvinen also suffered from sleep disorders and loneliness, and had few friends, although one former bully did go on to become a good friend of Auvinen's. His mother said inability to settle on a suitable ideology contributed to Auvinen's depression.His parents had noticed and reacted to the bullying problem, but their intervention only served to worsen the situation. According to entries in Auvinen's diary, he first began planning the shooting - which he gave the English name "Operation Main Strike" - about eight months prior to actually conducting the shooting.Auvinen had told his mother that under certain circumstances he could approve of violence. He had often viewed web sites promoting violence and had a number of online contacts whom he discussed his ideas with. One of these was a United States teen arrested for planning a similar attack, and two others discussed the Columbine High School Massacre with him and traded videos they found online. However, there is no evidence he informed anyone of his plans until immediately prior to the attack.The report called Auvinen a moderately good student, but noted his mental problems had impacted his performance at school. He had been interested in politics from an early age, being involved with the Centre Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Left Alliance, and the Finnish Communist Party."In the best case, this (attack) would create massive destruction and chaos, or even a revolution," read one diary entry. "In any case, I want this to be remembered forever. Maybe I'll even have a follower; after all, I am a super-person, almost God." Another revealed he intended to "kill as many of you bastards as possible". His diary also reveals he was aware he would be dead by the end of the attack.He obtained a .22 calliber handgun which he named Catherine, having been denied a license for a 9mm gun, and submitted his plans online - including to YouTube - just 14 minutes prior to firing his first shots, having cycled to school. It was determined that, given the time-frame, there was little that could have been done by anyone who saw the material to prevent the attack. He fired 75 shots, 50 of which struck his eight fatally wounded victims, who were apparently chosen at random. Thirteen others were injured in the event.The deceased were six students, the school headmistress and the school nurse. Auvinen shot at each several times in the region of the head and upper torso. He ultimately shot himself in the school toilet, and died in hospital from head wounds ten hours later, having never regained consciousness.Police could not determine why he chose the date he did, although it was noted his online relationship with a foreign girl had ended just days before. It was also determined little could be done to predict and prevent future incidents, although one measure being sought is to require medical checks for gun licences and parental consent for prospective owners under 18.The confidential section of the report discusses causes of death and police operations.With current flu levels classified as "high" around the state, public health officials in Texas are encouraging citizens to seek vaccination. While many officials anticipated the flu season to peak in January, it has seemingly arrived much earlier in many parts of the state.Health officials are urging citizens to seek care with their primary doctors, instead of their local hospital emergency rooms. They also recommend that everyone over age six months receive a flu vaccination. Thus far in December, over 450 cases of influenza have been reported in just a small portion of central Texas. Four recent deaths are being blamed on a flu-like illness. Other citizens are also showing signs of the same unknown condition, health officials said.  A nurse for a Texas school system noted during a media interview, "The number one prevention for the flu and cold is hand washing, [from] little kids [up to] big kids." People suffering from the symptoms report fever, and coughing along with headaches and fatigue. One Texas man told Wikinews, "I had the flu just a few weeks ago. It was awful. I was miserable."Public officials and other experts gave presentations earlier this week regarding lessons learned during the aftermath of an explosion which struck the small town of West, Texas in April of this year. The event, which was live-streamed to various locations across Texas, was sponsored by the Texas Department of State Health Services as a part of its Grand Rounds seminar offerings. Three officials, each of whom were heavily involved in responding to the event, gave individual presentations.Frank Patterson, Emergency Management Coordinator for the city of Waco and McLennan County, was the first to speak. Early on, Patterson commented about injuries sustained by citizens of West who lived in the neighborhood surrounding the chemical plant where the explosion occurred. He also said 113 different agencies responded to the event. Specifically, Patterson said, "This was the first time I didn't have to request federal [agency] support. They just showed up."  He also presented a broad array of photos taken from the blast site and the surrounding neighborhood, pointing out that debris was found as far as 2.5 miles away from the chemical plant. Regarding lessons learned during the days following the explosion, Patterson said all such incident teams need a social media person on-site. He also said, "Stress will take its toll on all involved."Dana Lafayette represented the local mental healthcare provider for the county. She explained mental health professionals offered assistance following the blast, but avoided being too intrusive with citizens. Lafayette clarified, "We would walk through [the area] and hand [survivors] water, along with the information cards and say, 'If you need us, we're here.'" She also stated, "It was interesting to see the amount of resiliency within the community."Kelly Craine, Public Information Officer for Waco-McLennan County Public Health District, also spoke. She indicated her agency's primary focus was to "create some sort of 'safe haven' for victims of the blast." Craine's agency used a local church as a gathering place for citizen displaced from their homes as a result of the incident. Notably, speaking about her agency's after action report, Craine said, "This [event's] after action report is so big, we're still working on ours."According to press releases from the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN), Unit 2 of the Penly Nuclear Power Plant in France shut down Thursday afternoon after operators were alerted to "small quantities of burning oil." The plant is operated by Électricité de France (EDF). Emergency crews were dispatched to the 1,330-megawatt French reactor following an alarm triggered there at 11:20 UTC Thursday. According to EDF, there were "no consequences for the environment" and no one was injured.The ASN said in a statement the anomaly had been provisionally placed at level 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which ranks occurrences at nuclear power plants on a scale ranging from 1 to 7, with 7 representing an event with lasting consequences for health and the environment such as the Fukushima Daiichi disaster following a Tsunami in Japan in March 2011.The alarm was triggered after two fires broke out in the reactor building. The fires are reported to have been caused by leaks in one of the cooling pumps that are part of the reactor's cooling system. The source of the fire was determined to be one or more pools of oil which had leaked from one of a pump's joints, catching fire. They were quickly suppressed and the reactor remains shut down due to damage to the cooling pump. After the fires were put out, radioactive water was then discovered to be leaking from the pump into the reactor's drainage bin.The ASN released a statement at 05:00 UTC saying they had received "confirmation by EDF that the leak in the primary pump n°1 of the reactor n°2 at the Penly NPP had stopped." ASN has undertaken an investigation into the causes of the incident which will later be published on their website. The reactor will remain shut down until the damage is repaired and the cause of the incident is known.The Penly nuclear site, located on the coast to the northwest of Paris, is home to two Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) units and is cooled using water from the English Channel. PWRs are a common variety of nuclear reactors named for their use of highly pressurized water in their primary cooling systems. All of the 58 nuclear power plants which supply France with over 75% of its energy, are of this type.A nightclub hosting a rock concert in Ecuador's capital Quito has been swept by fire ignited by pyrotechnics. At least 15 people are dead and 35 injured.The nightclub was located around 500 metres from the city's main commercial centre, which is in the south of the city.Figures for dead and injured come from the Red Cross. 300 people had flocked to the Factory club for a music awards ceremony.One of the deceased, who were all between 24 and 25 years of age, has been identified but their name is not public. The rest are badly burned and may take up to ten days to identify. 16 of those injured remain hospitalised for burns and suffocation. According to Vice Mayor Margarita Carranco those killed “died because they were in the rear area where the blaze ignited, or because they were trampled by the crowd”.While rescuers continue to search for any remaining bodies, police are investigating the disaster. One line of enquiry concerns whether adequate safety precautions were taken. Quito Fire Chief Jaime Benalcazar informed local radio that the emergency exits were padlocked shut. Preliminary investigations show that a roman candle lit by a band member triggered the disaster. The Factory had not been authorised to hold the event.City authorities declared three days of mourning and vowed to sue alongside relatives of the deceased. The city will pay all costs for DNA testing, burial and transport of two bodies to other provinces.Australian Transport Safety Bureau announced that an oxygen cylinder which was located near the area of the explosion on Qantas flight QF30 from London, England to Melbourne, Australia was unaccounted for but said that it was too early to say that an oxygen cylinder could be the cause of the mid-air explosion. It did say it had ruled out explosives as a cause stating that they "found no indication of explosives".The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has ordered Qantas to check all oxygen cylinders and the brackets which hold them on its Boeing 747s, but hasn't ruled out that the order will be extended to all of the Qantas fleet.Australian airline Qantas has returned the first of its fleet of Airbus A380s to service, after all six of the "superjumbo" aircraft were grounded three weeks ago following one aircraft's engine sustaining extensive midair damage; it landed safely in Singapore without injury. The airline stated that all of the aircraft have undergone extensive safety inspections and they are satisfied they are safe. Alan Joyce, CEO of Qantas, said: "It's great that we can reintroduce the aircraft. We are 100 percent comfortable with it. If we weren't, we wouldn't be restarting the operations today." A spokesperson confirmed that tests had been performed "in close consultation with Rolls-Royce and Airbus" on the model's Trent 900 engines. Qantas has replaced at least 14 engines, and modifications have been made to Trent 900s used by two other companies, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.Experts said that the incident was embarrassing for Airbus; the airline's shares have dropped by 7% since. Aviation journalist Tom Ballantyne said that the failure earlier this month was "certainly the most serious incident that the A380 has experienced since it entered operations." The A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007, and is now in service with several other airlines, including Air France. It is the largest commercial passenger airliner in the world, with an 840-passenger maximum capacity, though Qantas's can carry 450. There are reportedly plans to build a cargo version of the plane, which, aviation experts have suggested, would be the world's first "triple-decker" freight aircraft; Airbus has not confirmed that this variant will be built.A 14-year-old boy has been killed in an accident involving a quad bike in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The boy has been identified as Paddy McErlean, who crashed near his house in the town of Maghera.What is believed to have happened is that Paddy was travelling on an all-terrain vehicle with a 16-year-old boy along a rural road at around 2200 GMT on Thursday when the vehicle smashed into a post, the boys were then thrown from the road. The 16-year-old boy is critically injured and as of yet has not been identified.Ann Scott, who is the head teacher in St. Patrick's College, which is the high school that Paddy attended, said: "This tragic accident really has brought a profound sense of loss to the school. The loss of Paddy, who was only 14, has just shocked everybody at the college. He really contributed a lot to the school, he was full of life, he was such a lovely young lad, very popular with the staff and pupils and we will really miss him so terribly."An earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter Scale has been reported off the coast of Japan's main island, Honshū.Whilst a major earthquake, the epicentre was well away from any population centres, and initial tsunami warnings predicting half-meter surges were later withdrawn.Due to its size, the quake was felt in Tokyo, over 300 miles away.A moderate earthquake struck Baja California near the Mexico-United States Border  at around 8:15 p.m. (pacific time) February 8. With a magnitude of 5.1, the quake's center was reported to have been between the towns of Mexicali and Tijuana. No injuries or damage was reported.Director of civil defense in Mexicali, Fire Capt. Rene Rosado, said several factories have been cleared of workers so that engineers might access possible damage to the structures. Another two bridges have been closed so that cracks could be examined. 400,000 people have been left without electricity, and 1.2 million are unable to use their cell phones. The initial quake was followed by around 15 aftershocks and felt, "pretty widely in Southern California, southwestern Arizona and probably northern Mexico," said Jessica Sigala, a geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS).In what can only be described as yet another addition to a long list of unfortunate happenings in Haiti, the Category 1 Hurricane Tomas displaced a large number of the population on Friday, most notably in Port-au-Prince, the capital city, where earthquake refugee camps serve as a home to as many as 1.3 million victims of the January 12 earthquake.The earthquake, along with the consequent cholera epidemic, claimed the lives of 250,000 Haitians, and while the hurricane was not considered severe, it's resulting flooding has the already-vulnerable population worried. "I'm scared that if I leave they'll tear this whole place down. I don't have money to pay for a home somewhere else," said Clarice Napoux, a 21 year-old resident in Port-au-Prince, who was displaced by the quake. People are indeed leaving, however, as many as 8,000 refugees in areas vulnerable to the heavy rainfall, predicted in upwards of 10 inches, were forced to seek higher ground.Tomas' flooding has reportedly claimed the lives of three citizens; two of which were in the town of Léogâne, to the south of the capital. The local Haitian government evacuated more than 200 inmates from a coastal prison. However, many citizens are upset with what they see as inadequate response to the floods."They have a reason to be mad. The central government hasn't done anything here," said Wilson St. Juste, deputy mayor of Haiti. The federal government, however, has made efforts to remind its citizens of the enormous strain it is already experiencing resulting primarily from previous damage and relief efforts.    "We have two catastrophes that we are managing. The first is the hurricane and the second is cholera," President Rene Preval noted in a national press release. The Red Cross has worked to accommodate those affected by the floods, and the USS Iwo Jima is standing by off the coast with relief supplies. "We got flooded out and we're just waiting for the storm to pass. There's nothing we can do," said one resident Friday. Indeed, the thousands that have been displaced twice can but sit and wait for Tomas' effects on an already stretched-thin nation to pass.Thousands of residents are evacuating coastal areas of far north Queensland (QLD), set to be lashed by Cyclone Larry tomorrow morning. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology warns that the "very destructive core of Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry, with extreme gusts up to 280 km/hr (174 mph) should cross the coast between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. AEST on Monday (Sunday, 2100 to 2300 UTC). Destructive winds are expected to commence along the coast between Ingham and Port Douglas. Gales are already being experienced along the exposed coast in the warning area."Tropical Cyclone Larry, currently building off far north Queensland, is expected to intensify before crossing the coast. Queensland tropical cyclone warning centre spokesman Bruce Gunn says people should treat warnings very seriously. "This is the worst cyclone we have had for many, many years," he said.The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) says the cyclone poses a "very serious threat to life and property" and will now post warnings on the hour on its website.The BOM also warns coastal residents between Cairns and Townsville of dangerous storm tide when the cyclone crosses the coast. The bureau says the sea is likely to steadily rise up to a level which will be significantly above the normal tide, with damaging waves, strong currents and flooding of low-lying areas extending some way inland. People living in those areas should be prepared to evacuate if advised by authorities.Mandatory evacuations have been enforced in low-lying seafront areas, including in the Johnstone and Cardwell shires south of Cairns, which are expected to bear the force of Larry and its four metre storm surge.Disaster coordination centres have been activated in Cairns and Townsville. "There have been mandatory evacuations of coastal shires south of Cairns ... and emergency shelters set up for people who feel at risk with nowhere to go," said a Cairns City Council Disaster Coordination Centre spokesman. "It's most likely thousands of people are evacuating to avoid the high tide."Premier Peter Beattie has issued a disaster declaration. Local governments now have the power to enforce mandatory evacuations. Queensland Education Department announced that schools in the hardest hit areas will be closed tomorrow, while flights to Townsville and Cairns have been cancelled. State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers are doorknocking and advising residents to leave. Bruce Gunn from the Queensland cyclone warning centre says the cyclone will coincide with a high tide. "We are talking seawater a couple of metres above the high-tide mark, possibly more than that, with waves on top, so this is a very serious situation we are talking about," he said.Mr Gunn told the ABC that severe weather will be experienced several hours before the cyclone reaches the coast. "While we are saying the coastal crossing will be between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. AEST, the few hours leading up to that will be rather bumpy — not very nice to experience," he said.It has emerged that the 33 Chilean miners trapped underground after the mine they were working in collapsed could be brought to the surface in a shorter time than was initially feared. While officials publicly announced that the men would not be brought to the surface until Christmas, sources inside technical meetings have revealed that they could in fact be on the surface by early November. The news comes as families were allowed to speak by radio-telephone to their trapped loved ones on Sunday. Over the weekend, video images filmed by the miners emerged showing the miners playing dominoes at a table and singing the Chilean national anthem. The miners also used the camera to send video messages to their families on the surface, saying that they regularly broke into tears, but were feeling better having received food and water.The grainy nightvision images, filmed on a high definition camcorder that was sent down a small shaft to the mine, show the men in good spirits, chanting "long live Chile, and long live the miners." They are unshaven and stripped to the waist because of the heat underground, and are seen wearing white clinical trousers that have been designed to keep them dry. Giving a guided tour of the area they are occupying, Mario Sepúlveda, one of the miners, explains they have a "little cup to brush our teeth", and a place where they pray each day. "We have everything organized," he tells the camera. Gesturing to the table in the center of the room, he says that "we meet here every day. We plan, we have assemblies here every day so that all the decisions we make are based on the thoughts of all 33." Another unidentified miner asks to rescuers, "get us out of here soon, please." A thermometer is shown in the video, reading 29.5C (85F).As the film continues, it becomes evident that the miners have stuck a poster of a topless woman on the wall. The miners appear shy, and one man puts his hand to his face, presumably dazzled by the light mounted on the cameraman's helmet. One miner sent a message to his family. "Be calm", he says. "We're going to get out of here. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts." Another said that the miners are "sure that there are people here in Chile that are big people, that are powerful people, that are intelligent people, and they have the technology and they will all work together to get us out of here." Speaking to the camera, one says: "we have had the great fortune that trapped in this mine there are good, professional people. We have electricians, we have mechanics, we have machine operators and we will let you know that while you are working to rescue us on the surface, we are down here ready to help you too." It has been reported that Mario Gómez, 63, has become the group's "spiritual leader", having worked in the mines for over fifty years. He has requested that materials to build a shrine be sent down to the cavern.Upon seeing the video in a private screening, family members, who are living in a small village of tents at the entrance to the San José copper-gold mine—which they have named Camp Hope—were elated. "He's skinny, bearded and it was painful to see him with his head hanging down, but I am so happy to see him alive", said Ruth Contreras, the mother of Carlos Bravo, who is trapped in the mine. The video, of which only a small portion has been released to the public, shows the miners, many of them wearing helmets, cracking jokes and thanking the rescuers for their continued efforts. The supplies are being sent to the men through a small shaft only twelve centimeters wide, and a laboratory has been set up with the purpose of designing collapsible cots and miniature sandwiches, which can be sent down such a narrow space.CNN reported on Friday that "officials are splitting the men into two shifts so one group sleeps while the other works or has leisure time .. On average, each man has lost 22 pounds (10 kilograms) since they became trapped three weeks ago, and dehydration remains a threat. But a survey of the men indicates that at least nine miners are still too overweight to fit through the proposed rescue shaft. Initially, the miners survived by draining water from a water-cooled piece of equipment. To stay hydrated in the 90-degree mine, each miner must drink eight or nine pints of water per day."But while there are jubilant celebrations on the surface that the miners are alive, officials are now nervous that the miners could become depressed, trapped in a dark room the size of a small apartment. Chilean health minister Jaime Mañalich said that, on the video, he saw the telltale signs of depression. "They are more isolated, they don't want to be on the screen, they are not eating well", he said. "I would say depression is the correct word." He said that doctors who had watched the video had observed the men suffering from "severe dermatological problems." Dr. Rodrigo Figueroa, head of the trauma, stress and disaster unit at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, explained that "following the euphoria of being discovered, the normal psychological reaction would be for the men to collapse in a combination of fatigue and stress ... People who are trained for emergencies – like these miners – tend to minimize their own needs or to ignore them. When it is time to ask for help, they don't." NASA has advised emergency workers that entertaining the miners would be a good idea. They are to be sent a television system complete with taped football matches. Another dilemma facing Mañalich is whether the miners should be permitted to smoke underground. While nicotine gum has been delivered to the miners, sending down cigarettes is a plan that has not been ruled out. With the news that drilling of the main rescue tunnel was expected to begin on Monday, officials have informed the media that they hope to have the miners out of the mine by Christmas—but sources with access to technical meetings have suggested that the miners could actually be rescued by the first week of November. A news report described the rescue plan—"the main focus is a machine that bores straight down to 688m and creates a chimney-type duct that could be used to haul the miners out one by one in a rescue basket. A second drilling operation will attempt to intercept a mining tunnel at a depth of roughly 350m. The miners would then have to make their way through several miles of dark, muddy tunnels and meet the rescue drill at roughly the halfway point of their current depth of 688m." Iván Viveros Aranas, a Chilean policeman working at Camp Hope, told reporters that Chile "has shown a unity regardless of religion or social class. You see people arriving here just to volunteer, they have no relation at all to these families."But over the weekend, The New York Times reported that the "miners who have astonished the world with their discipline a half-mile underground will have to aid their own escape — clearing 3,000 to 4,000 tons of rock that will fall as the rescue hole is drilled, the engineer in charge of drilling said Sunday ... The work will require about a half-dozen men working in shifts 24 hours a day." Andrés Sougarret, a senior engineer involved in operating the drill said that "the miners are going to have to take out all that material as it falls."The families of those trapped were allowed to speak to them by radio-telephone on Sunday—a possibility that brought reassurance both the miners and those on the surface. The Intendant of the Atacama Region, Ximena Matas, said that there had been "moments of great emotion." She continued to say that the families "listened with great interest and they both felt and realized that the men are well. This has been a very important moment, which no doubt strengthens their [the miners'] morale." The phone line is thought to be quite temperamental, but it is hoped that soon, those in the mine and those in Camp Hope will be able to talk every day. "To hear his voice was a balm to my heart ... He is aware that the rescue is not going to happen today, that it will take some time. He asked us to stay calm as everything is going to be OK ... He sounded relaxed and since it was so short I didn't manage to ask anything. Twenty seconds was nothing", said said Jessica Cortés, who spoke to her husband Víctor Zamora, who was not even a miner, but a vehicle mechanic. "He went in that day because a vehicle had broken down inside the mine ... At first they told us he had been crushed [to death]." Esteban Rojas sent up a letter from inside the mine, proposing to his long-time partner Jessica Yáñez, 43. While they have officially been married for 25 years, their wedding was a civil service—but Rojas has now promised to have a church ceremony which is customary in Chile. "Please keep praying that we get out of this alive. And when I do get out, we will buy a dress and get married," the letter read. Yáñez told a newspaper that she thought he was never going to ask her. "We have talked about it before, but he never asked me ... He knows that however long it takes, I'll wait for him, because with him I've been through good and bad."Radioactive water is leaking from the nuclear waste store in Forsmark, Sweden. The content of radioactive caesium in sampled water is ten times the normal value.  Statens strålskyddsinstitut (SSI, the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority) believes that the leakage originates from waste barrels that have corroded, since the radioactive water is leaking out from the waste disposal area of the Forsmark power plant. The radiation is, however, still within the allowed limits according to SSI. The waste is low and intermediate level waste. No high level waste has been reported. A new roof is to be constructed for the chamber containing the barrels.An RAF Hawk training jet has crashed at Mona Airfield on Anglesey Island in the United Kingdom. The crash occurred at 12:25 p.m. local time.The pilot is reported to have ejected prior to the crash. No injuries are reported at this time."I can confirm that a Hawk aircraft has crashed at RAF Mona, which is a small satellite airfield connected to RAF Valley. One person was on board but we do not know the extent of the pilot's injuries at this time," said spokesman for RAF Valley, Squadron Leader Mark Byrne.According to the U.K.'s Defense Ministry, the aircraft carries up to two pilots, but only one was on board the plane at the time of the crash.The plane was put into service in 1976 for flying and weapons training. The T1 version of the Hawk is for training pilots in fast flying at an advanced level and the T1A Hawk is designed to train pilots to use weapons at an advanced level. It is also the aircraft used by the Red Arrows RAF display team.Search and rescue personnel are on their way to the scene and an investigation is being launched. The wreckage of the plane is said to be in two pieces. It is not known what caused the crash."We will not speculate about the cause of the accident as an investigation will be carried out to establish what has happened," added Byrne.A rail accident occurred on Sunday night outside the town of Drama, northern Greece, having as a result the death of four people and the injury of 22. The Intercity train, which was operating the route from Thessaloniki to Alexandroupolis, had 65 passengers onboard and according the Hellenic Railway Organisation(OSE) the accident occurred when a truck driver attempted to drive through a grade crossing. Forty people were transferred to the Hospital of Drama and 22 remain hospitalised; two of them to be in critical condition. The driver of the truck, Yannis Papadopoulos, 40, a police trainee and a kindergarten teacher were killed, however the police have not released the names of the last two.OSE expressed its sorrow for the deaths and the Minister of Macedonia-Thrace visited the site of the accident and declared that the State acted immediately. However, this rail accident raises a question about the safety of the Hellenic Railways as well as the policies that the Greek Ministry of Transport should apply.According to reports, a train carrying containers of a gas, has been involved in a major incident near the Italian city of Viareggio at around midnight (local time). State television said the train derailed followed by an explosion.According to the latest reports from Protezione Civile, at least 14 people have been killed, with another 50 injured. Up to 35 of those have suffered serious burns. Three children were among those killed. WAtoday, stated that a street near the station in Viareggio, a coastal city of 50,000, was enveloped in flames. There are also reports of structural damage to buildings close to the incident, with two thought to have collapsed."The train was diverted and two of the carriages appear to have derailed," said journalist Nick Pisa to Sky News. "Along that side of the railway line there are houses and they caught the full effect of the blast." The train carried liquefied petroleum gas in tank rail cars, owned by the Austrian subsidiary of GATX Corporation.Penny Firth speaking to BBC News was quoted as saying "The explosion was terrifying. The whole sky turned orange and there was a huge mass of dense smoke, we could feel the heat intensify. It is just awful... the smell is horrible," The causes of the incident are under investigation, with an official inquiry already begun, although Italian rail unions, are already blaming outdated rolling stock, according to BBC News.Nearly two feet of the rail route in Kashmir, India was blown up by militants near the Pulwama district, affecting train services from north to south Kashmir. The blast came a few days after militants fought with the Indian army in the area, thereby killing fourteen people."There were no casualties, as no trains were running when the militants set off a powerful bomb on the railway track," said Aijaz Ahmad, a local police official. He added that train services have been temporarily suspended. According to police, the attackers detonated an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) near Galbug at about 10 PM local time (4:30 PM UTC), Thursday night. Two feet of the rail track on the Qazigund-Baramulla area was damaged. This track was developed two years ago, police sources stated. The attack came just before senior officers were supposed to inspect ongoing works in the Kashmiri railways. The track was repaired on Friday morning and train services resumed in the region. Kamal Saine, Deputy Inspector General of Police, south Kashmir, told the Press Trust of India agency that the damage to the track was not significant and it took a short time to mend it.A section of the rail tunnel outside Gerrards Cross Station in Buckinghamshire collapsed at around 8 p.m. last night. No-one was injured. 20 metres of concrete tunnel and gravel collapsed onto the Chiltern to Marylebone line, closing the railway and causing much disruption. The tunnel was created by the supermarket chain Tesco, who had filled in a railway cutting in order to build a supermarket above it. The project was unpopular both among the local community and the rail industry who felt the project put commercial gain before railway safety. The accident came hours after another rail accident in East Yorkshire, where a train collided with a car at a level crossing, killing the driver of the car and injuring five train passengers.Although severe rains have hit much of Texas in recent days, the Texas Water Development Board's latest weekly report indicated 46% of the state continues to encounter troubling drought conditions. The report released Monday also indicated, however, conditions were "moving in the right direction." The report further indicates the state's reservoirs, an integral part of citizens' water supply, is still 20 percent below normal. Large parts of East Texas experienced heavy rains earlier this month. Earlier this week, a severe rain storm struck the city of Tyler and surrounding areas. About 3,000 residents were without power at one point as a result of downed power lines. The city of Wichita Falls has seen a severely dry period, spanning well over three years. One media source recently stated the city had experienced its harshest 41-month drought period since 1897. Notably, experts predict Texas's population may nearly double over the next 45 years.Heavy rains have hit the main Hawaiian Islands for nearly six weeks, contributing to flooding in many places in the islands: a deadly dam break in northern Kauai, a sewage spill in Honolulu's Waikiki district, and record rainfall totals in many areas of the state.  A series of upper-level storm systems have formed northwest of the island of Kauai, drawing tropical moisture from the south over Hawaii and forming areas of heavy rain and thunderstorms.The island of Kauai, on which an earthen dam broke on March 7 killing seven people, has been hardest hit. Mount Waialeale, in the center of the island, has received 90 inches of rain during the month of March and 126.69 inches since the weather pattern began on February 19.  34.31 inches of rain had fallen at Lihue airport, the most rain in a single month since records started in 1950.Tourism officials are concerned about the long-term effect that the heavy rains may have on tourism, and they expect to launch a marketing campaign once the weather improves.The entire state remains under a flash flood watch until at least Saturday.  Weather forecasters expect a return to normal weather patterns early next week.The Servicio Médico Legal (in Spanish, Legal Medical Service) of Rancagua, Chile boss, Juan Díaz Menares, was suspended from his job for using a public bus to transport the body of three-year-old Juanita Carey.The decision was made by the administrative lawyer in the case, Hernán Rojas, who is heading the investigation into the irregular move of the body. Díaz defends the sending of the body via a public bus, ensuring that "the procedure was right, because it was sent as it is established". "There's an aberrant situation at a national level, not just this", said Díaz; "It is always done [...] we are a centralized service, we don't rule ourselves.""Everything that comes out of here, biological or bony samples, as in this case, go out from the safekeeping chain", he also said. He confirmed that he was not going to resign, as Radio Cooperativa had reported.Last Wednesday, it was revealed that the body of the child, who died in Pichilemu after the February 27 catastrophe, stayed three nights in a storage area of bus company Pullman Cargo. A Pullman Cargo representative reported to Radio Cooperativa that the body was sent last Friday from Pichilemu to Santiago via bus, and that the container did not have any description of what it contained, beyond the word "fragile". They also said that "it was not even paid for express mail, which would have allowed the delivery to occur on Saturday, not last Monday".The body of the child was cremated Wednesday, and her ashes were buried in Santiago, Chile.A magnitude 5.8 earthquake has struck in a place where earthquakes are rare, but sometimes large.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), at 3:35 p.m (eastern time) the 5.8 quake struck in Antarctica, 105 kilometers (65 miles) south, southeast of Casey Station or 2565 kilometers (1590 miles) north of the South Pole. The quake was reported at a depth of 7.5 k.m. (4.7 miles), but the USGS says it was "poorly constrained."Had any civilization existed on the frozen ice cap, the USGS says that damage could be "light to moderate."Antarctica's biggest earthquake was a magnitude 8.1 which occurred on March 25, 1998 near the Balleny Islands of Antarctica.Tropical Storm Gonu headed toward Iran today, after lashing Oman for two days with high winds and torrential rains, and causing at least 23 deaths and the evacuation of more than 20,000 people to emergency shelters. Concern was high for the oil industry, as rough seas kept tankers from leaving their ports.Such storms are rare in the Middle East. Early today, Gonu was weakening and was downgraded to a tropical storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center projected the storm to continue weakening as it made landfall on Iran's southeastern coast. Offshore Iranian oil installations were expected to be spared, officials said.A reading taken from a "faulty" instrument panel on the Unit 1 reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant located near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania has caused the reactor to shut down, but officials say that there is no threat to the public as radiation has not been released into the air. A wrong reading was displayed on a control panel which triggered the reactor to automatically shut itself down."It appears this was an uncomplicated, smooth shutdown. The company will need to take a careful and deliberate look at what went wrong," said Nuclear Regularitory Commission spokesman, Neil Sheehan.A worker at the power plant was injured while the reactor was shutting down, after being scared by steam venting from the reactor, which caused him to fall.The reactor, which first went operational in 1974, shutdown on Thursday afternoon on the "non-nuclear side of the reactor" at 1:35 p.m. [EST] and as of the moment remains offline, added Sheehan. This is the first time since 1997 that the reactor has shutdown.In 1979, the Unit 2 reactor suffered a partial meltdown and has remained offline since the disaster.There were a record amount of fire calls during Guy Fawkes night, the festivities had emergency services stretched to the limit, a spokesman for the NZ Fire service said that it was "like driving through a war zone." Despite this, no major structure fires were reported.Preliminary numbers show that the amount of minor fires reported amounted to 1,729 between the period of October 27 and November 5. For the same period last year, 2005, there were only 1,632. Last year's numbers were also record setting at the time. Over the Guy Fawkes weekend, November 4 - November 5, there were 784 reports of fires. The actual numbers will be released soon, as the false alarms and multiple reports are separated out. A safety campaign by the NZ Fire brigade advising the public to call 111 on the suspicion of any fire is expected to have increased the number of calls per incident. Discussions on the NZ volunteer firefighter's mailing list suggest that the majority of bad behaviour occurred in urban areas.The New Zealand police had to report to 423 reports of disorder in the top half on the North Island alone and in just seven hours. There was a fight which involved 40 people, in Whitianga; police were called to break up that fight and were also called to stop youths from getting fireworks from a shop. Also, in Tauranga, police were called to a fight party of 200 youths at 1.00 a.m. In Mount Albert, Auckland, police were forced to retreat and wait for reinforcements during an incident.In Wellington, New Zealand, the police had to make 39 arrests, including assaults, disorderly behaviors and liquor ban breaches. The police said it was as bad as New Year's Eve. "It was as busy as New Year's Eve. It was one of the busiest nights we have had this year," Sergeant Maggie Windle said, "Alcohol was a big factor in a lot of the arrests and a lot of the offending. We were dealing with the bulk of this mass disorder."Remarkably, the St John's Ambulance Service reported only one serious firework related injury; a stabbing following an incident involving fireworks.Mike Hall, chief executive/national commander of the New Zealand Fire Service, said: "The unfortunate result vindicates his call for a retail ban on fireworks, made last month. Despite warnings and a safety campaign, and even with parts of the country being much wetter than they were last year, firefighters were still called out more times than ever. That means that firefighters cannot respond as quickly as they would like to genuine emergencies, and thousands of volunteers across the country are needlessly called away from work and family commitments."The Government had previously warned the public that a ban on the public sale of fireworks would be enacted if behaviour was deemed unacceptable over the Guy Fawkes season.Opinon polls indicate that the public is divided 50:50 over permitting the sale of fireworks, or wanting to see fireworks restricted to public displays or licensed operators. Mr. Hall said "the public are also sick of the danger to themselves, property and pets posed by misuse of fireworks, not to mention the late-night noise and mess associated with people letting off fireworks indiscriminately. The lack of a major fireworks-related fire or fatality at the weekend was pure luck."Allegedly Dunedin students were burning furniture in the streets.Marian Hobbs, Member of Parliament, said that she has put in a bill to stop fireworks to be used by the public: "I'm not saying ban fireworks. I'm not a killjoy. But it does give us powers to stop what is dangerous, time-consuming and expensive. We have to make a start and put our foot down on this."Transportation was seriously affected, as the two main highways, railway lines, and the runways at Mumbai International airport remain submerged. Trains and city buses were shut down for 24 hours, and have not yet resumed full service. Domestic and international flights have been diverted out of Mumbai. Residents of buildings in low-lying areas are being rescued with boats and navy helicopters. Large numbers of Mumbai residents did not make it home from work, or spent the night in cars that were stranded on the road. The All India Radio reported that 150,000 people were stranded across different railway stations of the Mumbai Suburban Railway, which is considered the life line of Mumbai. Mumbai Suburban Railway partially commenced operating after thirty-six hours, from late evening on July 27.The rainfall received in Mumbai's suburbs on Tuesday totaled 37.1 inches, which exceeds the world's record for highest rainfall in a single day (33.0 inches at Cherrapunji, Meghalaya, India).The heavy rainfall has taken its toll on historic buildings as well. A building on Marine drive has been drowned up to the first floor. Mackichan Knight from IIMC mourns this irreparable damage.As per Vilasrao Deshmukh, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, the rainfall cost the state $110m in damages.Correction: This does not exceed the world's record for highest rainfall in a single day, but it does exceed India's previous record. (33.0 inches at Cherrapunji, Meghalaya, India).The world record for rainfall in a 24-hour period was 75.98in which fell during a hurricane on Reunion Island near Madagascar.A powerful typhoon that killed 37 people in the Philippines has hit southern China. Typhoon Chanchu  battered coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces where an estimated 900,000 fled to safety. With winds up to 170 kph, Chanchu is the strongest typhoon on record to enter the South China Sea in May. Xinhua news agency said 11 people had died in China from the storm and four others were missing. The storm made landfall near Shantou in the northern tip of China's Guangdong province.Xinhua reports that Chenchu slammed in Shantou City of Guangdong and continued northward bringing gale-force winds and rainstorms to the regions and triggering flooding, mountain torrents and landslides. Nearly 200 houses in north Shantou were flooded stranding more than 6,400 people. Typhoons occur in the South China Sea every year between May and September.The fuselage of the Sikorsky S92 helicopter that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday has been found at a depth 120 to 150 meters and is being retrieved. 17 of the 18 people who were on board the helicopter died after it crashed.Personal belongings, upper and lower segments of the main entrance door, the aft cargo door, and one emergency exit door have been recovered.  “We totally dissect everything we can and certainly that is going to be an area that will be examined," said Mike Cunningham, lead investigator with the Transportation Safety Board (TSB). "It looks like the fuselage is relatively intact." An underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is aiding in the investigation.“The structure of the aircraft, the body of the aircraft seems to be in relatively solid state. The tail section has broken off and it is lying by the side of the aircraft which is not a problem.  We are still evaluating how it’s going to be brought to the surface but we believe it should be done relatively easily, possibly in a couple of days,” said Charles Laurence, TSB’s lead investigator of operations. The remaining victims may still be strapped within their five-point harnesses.The mayday to Transport Canada aviation database reported oil pressure in the main gearbox which caused the problem.  The gearbox links the engines and transmission and is located on the top of the fuselage and under the main rotor head.Robert Decker remains in critical at the St. John's Health Sciences Centre but has stabilised.  It is reported that he suffered a broken bone, hypothermia and had aspirated sea water.The recovered body is that of Allison Maher from Aquaforte, Newfoundland, aged 26. Throughout the search and rescue there were no locator signals received from survival suits of any of those missing.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have released the names of twelve of those who are are still missing. It is a partial list, as some relatives were "not prepared at this point of time to release the names of their loved ones, and we respect that," said Supt. Reg Reeves. They are:Peter Breen, from St. John's, N.L. age 55;Gary Corbett, from Conception Bay South, N.L. age 46;Wade Drake, from Fortune, N.L. age 42;Wade Duggan, from Witless Bay, N.L. age 32;Colin Henley, from St. John's, N.L. age 38;Ken MacRae, from Greenwood, N.S. age 47;Derrick Mullowney, from Bay Bulls, N.L. age 51;Burch Nash, from  Fortune, N.L. age 44;Paul Pike, from  Bay Roberts, N.L. age 49;Allison Maher,from  Aquaforte, N.L., age 26Tim Lanouette, from  Comox, B.C., helicopter first officer age 48; andThomas Anwyll, from  Langley, B.C. Crew member age 46.Flight Lieutenant Jon "Eggman" Egging, 33, of the RAF Aerobatic Team (The Red Arrows) has been killed in a crash, shortly after a display in Bournemouth, England.  This is the first fatality involving the team for 23 years.The BAE Hawk jet aircraft crashed at 13:50 BST on the banks of river Stour, near Throop village.  A witness, Shaun Spencer-Perkins, said the aircraft "bounced across the field [and] ... across the river.  Members of the public jumped into the water to search for the cockpit."  Bournemouth Airport closed briefly, following the incident, but has since reopened and is operating normally.Emergency services were called to the scene, but Egging, who was reportedly thrown clear of the cockpit during the crash, was pronounced dead at the scene, local police announced.  He joined the team in autumn 2010 and is the first active member of the team to be killed since 1988.  The Ministry of Defence is investigating the cause of the accident.Egging is believed to have been attempting to avoid nearby houses before the crash.  Local residents, who were attempting to rescue the pilot, found an empty ejector seat and parachute at the scene, and believed the pilot to be already dead when they found him.The Red Bull Racing Formula One racing team must prove to the Malaysian Grand Prix stewards that one of their cars is safe to race after Scottish driver David Coulthard suffered a crash at Friday's  opening practice. It was his second major suspension failure in as many weekends and his third major accident, having had his last race ended prematurely after a collision with Felipe Massa's Ferrari.A part failure caused Coulthard to run off the road. When he subsequently hit a kerb both sides of the front suspension completely failed, ripping both wheels loose. He was unable to participate in any more pre-race practice.After stewards met team head Christian Horner and technical head Adrian Newey a statement was released stating that the FIA technical delegate required to receive a detailed technical report from Red Bull. The purpose of this would be to prove that the vehicle is race worthy as determined by an article in the technical regulations. This article gives stewards the powers to prevent cars from competing if they are deemed to be unsafe."The Stewards, having met with the Team Principal and Technical Representative of Red Bull Racing in relation to the incident involving Car 9 in Practice 1, have requested that the competitor provide to the FIA Technical Delegate a report verifying that the integrity of the suspension is such that the car should not be deemed 'of dangerous constructions' under Art 2.3 of the 2008 Formula One Technical Regulations," read the statement.Howard told reporters he believed there would be no problems with clearing the vehicle for tomorrows race. The failed component, he said, had been fitted immediately after the race at Melbourne. "It was a front right track rod that failed. You can see that the adhesives failed and it just looked like a human error. So we have absolutely no concerns about the car's safety for tomorrow."Coulthard was also confident. I am not worried about my safety. Mechanical failures are part and parcel of grand prix racing unfortunately... We did 10,000 kilometres in testing in the car. It was just a new part which did just six laps. It was a fault in the manufacturing process and game over. One jumbo falls out of the sky you don't ground them. All history shows that things fail now and again. With the front suspension the car rides up."The American Red Cross is seeking at least 40,000 more volunteers to replace current relief workers suffering from fatigue.“This is a disaster of such scope and such significance that it is not going to go away in a few weeks or a few months,” said Ken Degnan, a spokesman for the American Red Cross. The organization is currently sheltering 116,000 victims. It has 36,000 volunteers in the field and is currently running 675 shelters across the nation.The reason the recruitment is needed is due to the fact that the 36,000 will begin to rotate as they go home to their families.Volunteers are encouraged to sign up on their local chapter's website or call and leave their contact information.From an Atlanta chapter email:"Please do not go to a Red Cross location without prior scheduling. Only scheduled volunteers will be working at each site. Thank you for your patience in this process. Our trained volunteers and staff are being utilized to respond to families in need and to the thousands of calls coming in from people wanting to help. However, we do appreciate your generous offer and will be in contact based on the current needs."The American Red Cross is not lending its usual assistance in New Orleans, because the Louisiana National Guard acted first.  After Saturday September 3, it was agreed with state officials the Red Cross was not needed because the large-scale evacuation of the city was under way.The organization explains on its web site:Access to New Orleans is controlled by the National Guard and local authorities and while we are in constant contact with them, we simply cannot enter New Orleans against their orders.The state Homeland Security Department had requested--and continues to request--that the American Red Cross not come back into New Orleans following the hurricane. Our presence would keep people from evacuating and encourage others to come into the city.The Red Cross does not conduct search and rescue operations. We are an organization of civilian volunteers and cannot get relief aid into any location until the local authorities say it is safe and provide us with security and access.The original plan was to evacuate all the residents of New Orleans to safe places outside the city. With the hurricane bearing down, the city government decided to open a shelter of last resort in the Superdome downtown. We applaud this decision and believe it saved a significant number of lives.On September 1, the Red Cross offered to Louisiana state officials to enter New Orleans, who rejected the offer due to logistical difficulties.  Making the offer the next day to Col. Jay Mayeaux, the deputy director of the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Red Cross was asked to wait 24 hours while preparations were made.  By the next day, Saturday September 3rd, the National Guard had arrived in the city, felt they had adequate supplies and did not need the Red Cross.Roadworks have triggered a massive explosion and fire on a fuel pipeline running through Ijegun, a suburb on the outskirts of Nigerian capital Lagos. Although the Nigerian Emergency Management Agency puts the current death toll at ten, the Nigerian Red Cross says at least 100 people have died.The oil pipeline was fractured after a construction vehicle struck it and erupted into a fireball, with fuel running down the street. At least twelve homes caught fire, and students ran from a nearby school that was also threatened. According to witnesses, students are among the dead.Firefighters have extinguished the blaze and work is now underway to try and reunite people separated during the fire and account for those present at the time.Disasters such as this happen regularly in Nigeria, but they are usually attributable to organised criminals breaking into pipes for their content or terrorist attacks, whereas this event appears to have been an accident.The New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) began an emergency evacuation of staff from Raoul Island, the largest and northernmost of the Kermadec Islands, due to a volcanic eruption that occurred this morning at 8:21am (New Zealand Daylight Time). Six DOC workers were living on Raoul Island when it erupted.Rolien Elliot, DOC Area Manager for Warkworth, said, “A helicopter has been sent to pick up the DOC staff that are based on the island, five of whom have been accounted for. One staff member is missing after going on a routine mission to check the water temperature of the lake .... We are monitoring the situation closely, with the safety of the staff being our top priority."DOC staff on the island have been communicating with New Zealand using a satellite phone.The last eruption occurred in 1964 (see photo), when workers had to be evacuated because of the possibility of continuing activity.It takes two days' sailing for a Navy frigate to reach Raoul Island from Auckland.As Japan last weekend marked the 66th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, concern continues to mount about new revelations of elevated radiation readings following the March 11 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.Evidence of unsafe levels of radiation within the food supply chain continues to emerge, with Japanese media reporting on Wednesday that a Greenpeace study has found radioactivity exceeding government-mandated levels in four out of eight fish samples taken from the Fukushima Prefecture.The news comes as media reports of recent weeks have highlighted spikes in radiation readings at the crippled plant. On August 3, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) reported potentially deadly levels of radiation in the damaged reactors, including one reading of 10 sieverts per hour. Such levels are enough to kill a person “within a few weeks”, according to the World Nuclear Association, and are 250 times the readings recorded immediately after the disaster.The radiation findings have further called into question the response of government and industry to the crisis, with renewed allegations of incompetence and dishonesty being levelled against Japanese authorities over the transparency of information released in the months following the disaster. TEPCO only conceded that “partial meltdowns” had occurred in up to three of the Fukushima site’s reactors last month.In testimony to Japanese parliament in late July, Professor Tatsuhiko Kodama, head of the Radioisotope Centre at the University of Tokyo, condemned the government's response to the catastrophe. His criticism centered on inadequate radiation measurement methods and the failure to properly protect communities potentially affected by radioactivity from the stricken plant, citing the example of school bus routes passing through areas, such as Iitate-Mura, with unsafe levels of radiation.Kodama says the “uranium equivalent” of the radiation from Fukushima amounts to “20 Hiroshima bombs”, while the natural decrease in radioactivity caused by the disaster is far slower than that caused by an atomic bomb: one-tenth against one-thousandth of original levels after a year.“We should recognize from the start that just like Chernobyl, Fukushima I Nuclear Plant has released radioactive materials equivalent in the amount to tens of nuclear bombs,” he said during his parliamentary testimony. “The resulting contamination is far worse than the contamination by a nuclear bomb.”Further criticism was levelled against authorities this week when The New York Times revealed that shortly after the initial disaster Tokyo bureaucrats had failed to warn evacuees in the Tsushima district that wind patterns were blowing radiation spewing from the Fukushima site towards them. Despite the recent revelations, the ongoing fallout from the catastrophe has largely slipped from the mainstream international news agenda. Australian online publication Crikey! last week denounced the poor airing of contamination and accountability issues in the Japanese press, claiming it has been left to bloggers and social media to accurately portray the still-unfolding crisis.It is in this context that unofficial citizen groups have begun conducting their own measurements of radiation levels at various sites around Japan. Yesterday, Al-Jazeera reported on one such group, called Safecast, whose US and Japanese investigators have discovered disturbing readings not identified by official government agencies. For instance, on August 7 the group uncovered ground readings of 20,000 counts per minute 28 kilometres from the stricken plant, well outside the government’s 20-kilometre mandatory evacuation zone.“Getting into this has showed us there is a lack of data everywhere,” says Sean Bonner, the group’s director.The Al-Jazeera report also quotes Jyunichi Tokuyama, a specialist with the Iwate Prefecture Agricultural and Fisheries Department, who said he was shocked to find radioactive hotspots up to 300 kilometres from Fukushima. "The biggest cause of this contamination is the rice straw being fed to the cows, which was highly radioactive," Tokuyama told Al Jazeera, reflecting fears about the effects of the disaster in terms of contaminated food supplies. In the wake of the ongoing crisis, the Japanese government has pledged to reduce the country’s reliance on nuclear power, reflecting widespread public concern.Belgian official Etienne Schouppe has announced that the final report into the wreck of a Kalitta Air Boeing 747 cargo plane crash at Brussels Airport will blame a bird strike.Kalitta 747 N704CK, bound for Bahrain, was taking off from Brussels and was four seconds past V1 speed when a bird strike occurred in engine #3. Two seconds after the bird strike the decision was taken to abort takeoff, but the jet was unable to stop in the distance left to it. V1 is the maximum speed at which takeoff can be safely aborted.The plane exited the runway and broke into three main pieces. None of the five crew members was injured.The investigation also confirmed that there was no structural failure prior to impact. The remnants of a kestrel were found in the engine. Flight K4-207 was carrying mail for DHL at the time, and severely damaged the Instrument Landing System during the crash, taking the equipment out of action for repairs. Both the runway and a nearby railway line were closed.Earlier this month, Kalitta announced cost-cutting measures in response to the current financial crisis. A quarter of the 800 workers are to be laid off, and eight or nine of the airline's fleet of 21 747s are to be taken out of service.Two years after a skydiving plane crashed in New Zealand, killing all nine on board, a report has blamed overloading for what was the nation's worst air accident for seventeen years. The modified aircraft was unable to handle a full complement of eight passengers.Five locals and four foreign tourists died when the FU-24 crashed on takeoff at Fox Glacier. Eyewitness accounts said the plane took off earlier than normal, pitching up steeply before falling from a high of about 100m (330ft). It struck the ground nose-first.The report by New Zealand's Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC), after an investigation led by Ian McClelland, says the aircraft did not accumulate sufficient airspeed before it took off. It further notes that the plane's centre of gravity was far to the rear. The plane had been converted three months prior from an agricultural aircraft and this had not been performed well, according to the TAIC.TAIC go on to say the Civil Aviation Authority failed to spot paperwork discrepencies when approving the modified aircraft. "As a result the aeroplane was being flown outside its loading limits every time it carried a full load of eight parachutists," said the report. It was "an accident waiting to happen".Graeme Harris, the nation's head of civil aviation, described weight checks as "basic airmanship, taught to every student pilot" and noted all pilots are responsible for conducting them. "It is very sad that a critical element of pre-flight planning, which should be second nature to any pilot, appears to have been done so poorly. This is an accident that no pilot should ever forget."The local victims were Adam Bennett, 47, Michael Suter, 32, Christopher McDonald, 62, and Rodney Miller, 55, who were professional skydivers, and pilot Chaminda Senadhira, 33. The foreign victims were Irishman Patrick Byrne, 26, Australian Glen Bourke, 18, German Annita Kirsten, 23, and Briton Brad Coker, 24.Chris Coker, Brad Coker's father, has urged NZ Prime Minister John Key to increase regulation. The local Civil Aviation Authority has already decreed no FU-24 should carry more than six individually weighed passengers as a result of the crash, and last year introduced a law aimed at tightening up adventure flight regulation. The stricter rules came into effect earlier this month.The TAIC report reminded pilots to calculate weights individually for each aircraft, as even two planes of the same model can differ. It further notes aircraft modification is "a safety-critical process that must be done in strict accordance with rules and guidelines and with appropriate regulatory oversight".A final report released today has found pilot error to be the cause of the crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 in Indonesia on March 7, 2007. 21 people were killed when the Boeing 737 airliner, carrying 140 people, overshot the runway at Adisucipto International Airport, near Yogyakarta. It crossed a road and then struck an embankment, bursting into flames, before stopping in a rice field, some 252m from the end of the runway.The pilot is found to have been singing as he began the final descent, in direct contradiction to the Garuda Basic Operations Manual, which calls for activation of the Sterile Cockpit Rule at 10,000 feet and below.The pilot was probably emotionally aroused because his conscious awareness moved from the relaxed mode “singing” to the heightened stressfulness of the desire to reach the runway by making an excessively steep and fast, unstabilised approach,” the report continued. However, it does say that he was fully aware that something was wrong during the approach, as he is recorded as having said “Oh, there is something not right.”The report found that that the aircraft was flown by the pilot in command at a speed far exceeding that at which the wing flaps were able to operate properly. The report continues to criticise the pilot further, saying that a cockpit alert by the Ground Proximity Warning System informing the pilot he was flying too fast sounded no less than 15 times, but the pilot failed to abort the landing. He also ignored the co-pilot telling him to execute a 'go-around procedure' after the aircraft struck the runway at speed and bounced back into the air.The co-pilot is himself found to be at error by the report, which points out that he should have taken over the controls from the pilot when it became clear the aircraft was being flown in a dangerous manner. However, the report did note that Garuda Indonesia had failed to give him any simulator training replicating a situation whereby the co-pilot would take over control duties from the pilot in charge due to unsafe handling of the plane; in fact, training was found to be inadequate for both members of the cockpit crew.In the report's own words: "During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times, and the copilot called for the pilot in command to go around. "The aircraft was flown at an excessive air speed and steep flight path angle during the approach and landing, resulting in an unstabilised approach. "The pilot in command did not follow company procedures that required him to fly a stabilised approach, and he did not abort the landing and go around when the approach was not stabilised. "His attention was fixated or channelised on landing the aircraft on the runway and he either did not hear, or disregarded the GPWS alerts, and warnings, and calls from the copilot to go around." Authorities were also found to be at fault, with the Indonesian Director General of Civil Aviation criticised for failing to identify inadequacies in pilot training procedures. he was also criticised for the fact that the aircraft had managed to go virtually un-inspected, with only two safety checks in a decade.The report adds that the Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting facilities at the airport were also lacking on the day of the accident, for struggling to access the crash site and for not having the appropriate fire suppressant upon their eventual arrival. The report says these delays likely had an impact on the survivability factors on board the plane in the moments after crashing, when the aircraft was in flames. It ultimately took more than two hours before the fire was put out. Another criticism leveled at the airport was that it failed to comply with international runway safety regulations.The report has triggered a call from Caroline Mellish, sister of Australian Financial Review Morgan Mellish, one of five Australians killed in the accident, for greater co-operation between different Indonesian authorities. "I think not working together as different departments in a government shows a lack of any sort of system," She said from Jakarta, to which she had travelled for the release of the final report."If they can't work together in different departments, I don't know how they are going to run a country and make any difference investigating this sort of accident and ensuring the recommendations do get carried forward to ensure that no more accident happen."However, she did have some sympathy to spare for the pilot who was in control of the plane that day when the possibility of his prosecution was raised: "I think having 21 deaths on your conscience is probably enough. I don't think prosecuting the man is going to make any difference."National Transport Safety Committee chairman Tatang Kurniadi said that no information from the report would be used in any criminal or civil liability investigations. "I would like to go back to the objective of this, the report was made by NTSC for safety purposes only, not for blaming, he said. "If any institution wants to ... follow up that accident, that's their own decision."The report contained the results from the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, but according to international regulations on aviation these black boxes are not allowed to be used for... liability purposes."We will not give police or any institution (information) other than for safety purposes only - it's in international regulations and we want to follow those regulations.A final report by the United Kingdom's Aviation Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) has found that a LOT Polish Airlines airliner became lost over London airspace due to pilot error. After a navigational system failed due to a mistake entering the jet's position the plane struggled to return to London Heathrow under Air Traffic Control's guidance as the Polish pilots struggled to understand English.LOT Flight 282, a Boeing 737, was carrying 89 passengers bound for Warsaw, but ran into trouble immediately after takeoff because the co-pilot entered an Easterly longitude instead of a Westerly one. The error occurred because Heathrow is just to the West of the nearby Prime Meridian Line.The navigational equipment was unable to function properly and shut down as a result, forcing the pilots to rely on ATC instructions. The pilot-in-command handled radio communications while the co-pilot flew the aircraft. However, the aircraft wandered lost around the surrounding airspace for the next 27 minutes because the pilots had such a poor grasp of English.The pilots, who still had some standby instruments functioning, were unable to follow the instructions and several times the aircraft was turned in the exact opposite direction to that commanded by ATC. A full transcript of communications between the plane and the controllers shows at one point ATC was forced to ask "At what heading do you think you are flying at the moment?"The jet also forced another aircraft to take evasive action after triggering a Short Term Conflict Alert. At the end of the emergency, the crew finally made visual contact with the runway at Heathrow and landed safely.The pilots had no idea what caused the instrument failure and suggested it may be mobile phone interference but testing revealed no anomalies with the aircraft systems. The report found that "A fairly simple error...went undetected and led to a serious incident."It went on to say that "An incident like this demonstrates how reliant pilots have become on the Flight Management System." The FMS is a central semi-automated control system that handles navigation and positioning, amongst other duties.The report also says that the close proximity of all London's airports to the Meridian Line "can lead crews to make such co-ordinate entry errors of this nature," and that as LOT rarely uses airports to the West of the line they will usually only deal with Easterly co-ordinates. Criticism is also levelled at ATC, who the report says should have been quicker to realise the serious nature of the problems on board the aircraft. The entity running the control tower says they intend to use this incident for training purposes.A 586-page report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released Wednesday indicated governments should prepare for continued weather-related catastrophes. The report noted highly populated and very poor areas are at highest risk, and stressed no country or continent is safe from these ongoing threats. The panel consists of Nobel Prize-winners, whose work in climatology indicates more intense tropical cyclones.The report placed blame regarding recent disasters on a combination of climate change caused by humans, population changes and poverty. The panel was founded in 1988 by the United Nations.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates recent severe weather conditions are costing upwards of US$80 billion per year. The report focused heavily on issues pertaining to coastal areas of the United States, specifically noting damage in those areas could increase 20 percent by 2030. The authors of the report stated some portions of India may become uninhabitable for floods and other problems.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pointed out other cities at lesser risk, such as: Miami, Shanghai, Bangkok, China's Guangzhou, Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, Myanmar's Yangon (formerly known as Rangoon), and India's Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta). Inhabitants of small island nations may have to leave their homes because of elevated sea levels and major storms. A total of 220 authors worked on the report.Carter Smith, The Executive Director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, told a state legislative committee on Tuesday that together wildfires and drought have caused an estimated $11 million dollars in damage to state parks during 2011. Severe damage was reported to Davis Mountains, Possum Kingdom, and Bastrop state parks.Mr. Smith stated that in August 2011 alone there was a 25% drop in visitors and noted the loss of nearly 4,000 homes across the state last year due to wildfires. An employee of Tyler State Park told Wikinews on Friday that the park's lake is currently "...about three feet low", but went on to state that staff had recently stocked the lake with freshwater trout. When asked about the park's overall status, the employee stated, "We're doing OK."In the U.S. Texas ranks lowest in state park funding per capita. Reportedly, the drought has impacted wildlife, with increases of sightings of bears, mountain lions and feral hogs in unusual locales.Police are reporting that there has been a passenger jet crash near the Nigerian capital of Abuja. The ADC Airlines flight to Sokoto crashed shortly after take-off. More than 100 passengers were on board, many are feared dead.An emergency spokesperson has stated that the plane burst into flames shortly afterwards, although eyewitnesses believe that there are some survivors from the crash. The task of recovering the dead is underway.The BBC reports, that the crash was caused by a storm, contradict the area's METAR, a standard form of aviation weather report, which indicated no major storm or bad weather in the area at the time of take-off. Winds were not severe and cloud cover was broken at 1200 feet, which would not impose a problem for passenger aircraft under normal operating conditions. However, multiple news agencies are reporting that a local radio station commented on bad weather at the time of the crash.According to the airline's web site, the flight that crashed was Flight 53, a Boeing 737, scheduled to take off from Abuja at 10:35 a.m. and land in Sokoto an hour later.A local source said that the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Mohammadu Maccido, may have been on board. Senior government officials, senators, politicians and the son of one of Nigeria's former presidents were on board.A Sokoto State government spokesman Mustapha Sheu said that the northern state's deputy governor, education commissioner and another senator were killed, along with the sultan and his son.Sultan Muhammadu Maccido, revered as a leader of the Muslims in Nigeria and Niger, will be widely mourned. He will be remembered as the peace maker between sporadically warring Muslims and Christians in Nigeria. The local hospital reports that seven survivors have been admitted. One is in a critical condition.After visiting the crash site, Federal Territory Minister Mallam Nasir el-Rufai told the BBC that the condition of the plane was "deplorable", with "bald tyres".One out of every four United States bridges needs repairs and updating according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The total estimated cost of repairs is US$140 billion, and will continue to rise if not dealt with immediately, according to the report published by AASHTO.The necessity for bridge repairs has been just one of the infrastructure needs for which federal assistance has been requested by some state officials. Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania said that, "we need federal intervention, and federal intervention at a big level."Additionally, Rendell stated that, "no matter how hard a state applies its efforts and its resources to this problem, it's never going to make enough of a dent without significantly and radically increased federal help.""States are doing their best to improve them, but construction costs are skyrocketing ... forcing states to delay needed repairs," said Pete K. Rahn, head of the Missouri Department of Transportation and AASHTO president to Associated Press. "Without a national commitment to increasing bridge investment, we will see a continuing spiral towards deterioration and, ultimately, bridge closures in order to protect the traveling public."AASHTO's report, titled "Bridging the Gap: Restoring and Rebuilding the Nation's Bridges", stated that nearly every one in five bridges is 50-years-old or older. Furthermore, of the 600,000 U.S. bridges, nearly 152,000 (about one in four) need significant repair. "Almost one in four bridges, while safe to travel, is either structurally deficient, in need of repair." The report notes that the average age of American bridges is 43 years.The report was released just days prior to the one-year anniversary of the August 1, 2007 I-35W bridge collapse, which resulted in the death of 13 people.According to the newly formed BNO News Agency, an unnamed man tried to hang himself on an American Airlines flight which took off from Cibao International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was traveling to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City located in the state of New York.American Airlines flight 834 was en-route to New York when the pilot reported  that there was a medical emergency on board the plane. BNO says that a man had attempted to hang himself while the plane was in mid-flight. When the plane landed, the man was taken off the plane by emergency services who were on standby at JFK Airport.Despite the report, American Airlines previously refused to comment on the incident because of the passengers privacy, but an unnamed official said that they had heard about the incident, "but [believed] it is not true." The airline later stated to BNO that "the passenger did not try to commit suicide, however the passenger did have a medical condition that prompted our crew to call the tower and request assistance." Even though the airline insists there was no suicide attempt, BNO states that the FBI was called and put on standby at the airport along with emergency services. Their involvement in the situation is not yet known, but BNO says the FBI is investigating.On February 10, 2006, a man died after hanging himself in a bathroom aboard a United Airlines flight traveling from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, California.The United Kingdom's Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB) has issued two reports today into collisions between jetliners in the same spot at Manchester Airport. None of the 468 passengers caught in the incidents, which were in separate years, were injured.The first report concerned an incident in 2007 in which a Pakistan International Airways Boeing 777 struck a Flybe Bombardier Q400. The 777 was trying to turn in behind the Q400 onto the taxiway when its wingtip struck the smaller aircraft's rudder. The 777's pilot had been "cautioned about the presence" of Flybe's plane, according to the AAIB. The pilot stated that he believed he had sufficient room to manoeuvre and that he expected a further warning were this not the case. The aircraft were later able to continue on their journeys.The second report issued today involves the exact same location, this time scene of a collision in 2008. A Boeing 737 operated by now-defunct Spanish airline Futura was instructed to "give way"; this confused the flight crew of the Tenerife-bound plane and it moved forward, one wingtip striking the tail of a Lufthansa Airlines Airbus A320 destined for Frankfurt.The Futura flight crew had believed they had an unobstructed path with plenty of space to clear the A320. The AAIB recommended that Manchester's air traffic controllers stop using the phrase "give way" and instead state "hold position". Procedures have already been changed at Manchester in light of the collisions.Investigators say that flaws in the design of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota may have caused it to collapse and that the design flaw is not "unique" to the Minneapolis bridge.According to an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the flaw was found in the steel plates connected to girders, which are large support beams used in construction and connect the plates together. It is reported that extra stress from construction equipment might have caused the plates to separate, causing the bridge to collapse.The flaw has not yet been confirmed to be the source of the disaster, and the NTSB says that the investigation could take several months to fully be completed.At least six people were killed and at least eight are missing, whilst over 100 are injured after the bridge collapsed on August 1.Rescuers are continuing their efforts to reach the trapped miners in the Beaconsfield mine in northern Tasmania.A five tonne borer drilling machine has been secured in place to drill a one metre hole through the remaining 12-16 metres of rock that fell into the main shaft.Since drilling began at 7pm last night, the machine has made a 2 cm wide pilot hole half way to the miners.The trapped miners have been given egg sandwiches and yogurt, and have received  apple ipod MP3 players filled with the miners favourite songs to pass the time and drown out the sounds of the drilling.Meanwhile on the surface, the ever-growing media frenzy in Beaconsfield has forced the mine operators to enforce bag checks of rescuers entering the mine to ensure that no recording devices are taken into the mine.Humanitarian aid groups and Chinese military forces are beginning rescue operations in western China after a heavy 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the region on Wednesday, that reportedly killed over 600 people and injured almost ten thousand.The quake, which was centered around the remote town of Yushu, was largely destroyed by the heavy temblor, which occurred early in the morning as residents were waking up. The official death toll stands at 617, while 9,980 more were injured and an additional 313 reported as missing. The Chinese ministry of civil affairs reports that 15,000 houses had collapsed and 100,000 people - almost the entire population in the area - remain without homes.The plateau where the earthquake hit is frequently visited by tremors; however, there are rarely many casualties due to its remoteness and small population. However, in May 2008 a heavy 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Sichuan foothills, killing 80,000 people.A rescue helicopter crashed in Abruzzo, Italy on Tuesday. All six on board died.The flight was taking a wounded skier from the Campo Felice ski resort in Rocca di Cambio to the regional capital, L'Aquila. It crashed near the resort. The mountainous site is around 100km (60 miles) from the scene of an avalanche last week at the Rigopiano hotel, where at least fifteen died and several remain missing. Rescue operations at the hotel, which is on the other side of mountain Gran Sasso, are ongoing. Rescuers diverted away from the scene to assist with the helicopter accident. Lucoli mayor Gianluca Marrocchi said the helicopter was flying low. "After that it disappeared in the fog," he said to RAI.Some witnesses said there was an explosion before the crash, and the local police said a crash signal was activated. A police spokesperson commented to AFP, "The area where it came down is hard to access at the best of times, and thick fog is making it even more difficult[.]"The region has seen heavy snowfall and several earthquakes recently. Thousands of residents have spent a week without electricity. Campo Felice is around 120km from Rome, and popular with skiers from the capital.Rescuers working to free miners trapped during the Beaconsfield mine collapse have moved to a slightly faster blasting method. The rescue effort was expected to conclude on Sunday, however due to rescuers encountering extremely hard rock, it has been once again delayed.The vertical distance had previously been estimated at 1.5 metres, although rescuers believe it could be less with work being carried out overnight.Todd Russell, 34, and Brant Webb, 37, have been underground for 13 nights after a minor earthquake triggered a rockfall in the Beaconsfield Gold Mine. They survived because they were in a small cage when the collapse occurred. Their workmate Larry Knight, 44, died in the collapse, and his funeral is to be held in Launceston on Tuesday. His family members have delayed the funeral proceedings with the hope that the trapped miners will be freed and able to attend.A rescue operation is underway after sixteen-year-old American Abby Sunderland, attempting to sail around the world by herself, lost contact with her family while in the Indian Ocean.Sunderland, from Thousand Oaks, California, had originally hoped to become the youngest person to sail around the world nonstop by herself. She departed from Marina del Rey, California on January 23, 2010 and was about halfway through the attempt when Sunderland's family lost communication with her Thursday morning. That night, an Australian plane was able to locate her 40-foot (12.2-metre) long boat, Wild Eyes, which had lost its mast earlier.Sunderland had been sailing amid a rough storm in the Indian Ocean early Thursday when her boat was flipped over. The mast broke off as a consequence. After losing contact, the teenager activated two manual distress radiobeacons, or EPIRBs, and a search-and-rescue operation was formed. As part of the operation, a Qantas Airways Airbus A330 was sent over the ocean by Australian authorities. The plane's crew was able to make radio contact with Sunderland, and confirmed that she was not injured and that her boat was upright, but was unable to continue sailing. The closest rescue boat, a French fishing ship, was about 24 hours away from Sunderland's location when she was found, and is expected to meet her later today. She was stranded about 2000 miles (3218.7 kilometres) southwest of Australia's coast.This is not Sunderland's first obstacle during the journey. Near the beginning of the voyage, she made a stop at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, after the boat's generators were not producing enough power. She resumed the attempt in February, but autopilot problems forced another stop at Cape Town, South Africa for repairs in April, and she had to give up going for the unassisted record.Sunderland's parents, Laurence and Marianne, have vigorously defended against claims that their daughter was too young to be attempting such a feat.  They have also been criticized for allowing her to depart the United States at the beginning of the year, because Sunderland would likely arrive in the Indian Ocean during the region's winter.  Marianne Sunderland has said that Abby would likely not try "something of this magnitude again."  Last year, her brother Zac had completed a circumnavigation when he sailed solo around the world at the age of seventeen.  She had begun preparing for this journey at the age of thirteen.Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 crashed 1,750km (1,100 miles) north-west of Rio de Janeiro killing all people onboard, on Friday September 29. National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) has confirmed that the crashed Brazilian airplane did crash into a smaller aircraft. Rescue workers and air force personnel are searching the wreckage for bodiesIn Mellville, West Virginia, the remains of two miners have been found. The two miners had disappeared at the Alma coal mine when a conveyor belt caught fire."We have found the two miners we were looking for for [sic] the past 40 hours," said Doug Conaway, director of the state Office of Miners' Health Training and Safety. "Unfortunately we don't have a positive outcome."Governor Joe Manchin, Massey Energy Chairman Don Blankenship and U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller went to a church where the victims families were waiting to tell them the news."For over what 45 hours we've been together with the families, we do not have the outcome that we had desired, that we had been hoping for. We have two brave miners that have perished. These two men who perished in this mine, the 12 men who perished in the Sago Mine, I can only say to each of those families ... that they have not died in vain," Manchin said at a press conference after receiving the news.On Monday, Manchin plans to introduce legislation dealing with rapid responses in emergencies, electronic tracking technology and mandate reserve oxygen stations for underground miners.Manchin is expected to go to Washington D.C. on Tuesday to discuss his proposals with West Virginia's congressional delegation.The miners became separated from their team when fire broke out. Nineteen other miners were able to escape without injury.The two have been identified as Don Bragg, 33, and Ellery "Elvis" Hatfield, 47. They had been missing since Saturday.Rescuers in Brazil are seeking a plane that disappeared Friday carrying six people, two local pilots and four British investors interested in a possible new housing development.The dual-engined Cessna 310, operated by Aero Star, lost contact with Air Traffic Control (ATC) eight miles (13km) off the coast near Ilheus, where it was intending to land in nine minutes time and was making a visual approach to Ilhéus Jorge Amado Airport. The flight had originated in Salvador and made last contact at 5:43 p.m. local time (2043 GMT) with Ilheus control tower.The four passengers have been identified as Sean Woodhall, Ricky Every, Alan Kempson and Nigel Hodges. The planned development they had been considering is a luxury estate planned by Worldwide Destinations, who Sean Woodhall owns. It is based in Spain and constructs worldwide luxury property developments.Ricky Every works for Worldwide Destinations, and Alan Kempson and Nigel Hodges are both directors of UK finance company Diamond Lifestyle Holdings, who had been considering a deal with Worldwide. At least three of the four did not live in the UK.The search for the aircraft is focusing on a location 20 miles (32km) North of Ilheus, where there are eyewitness reports that a light aircraft was flying extremely low and without lights, leading authorities to believe the aircraft loss power. Investigations are probing some reports of witnessing a plane crash, and there are unconfirmed rumours that wreckage has been found.Brazil's Coast Guard, three Aero Star helicopters and Bahia state police are all participating in the search. The weather was good at the time and the flight crew hadn't reported any issues to ATC.Egyptian rescue workers have ended a search for possible victims of a collision between two ferries on the Nile River.Local officials said that they found no bodies and have accounted for everyone, after initial reports suggested dozens of passengers and crew members were missing following the collision on Friday. Rescuers searched on Friday night and early on Saturday for possible victims; officials say at least six people were injured.The two ferries collided near the northern city of Rashid, causing one of the boats to overturn.  At least 30 people were on board the boats at the time of the accident. Officials are investigating the cause of the incident.Rescuers working with cranes and heavy equipment at the scene of Japan's worst rail accident in forty years pulled 3 survivors and more bodies out of the wreckage of a packed commuter train that derailed on Monday. The crash is now claiming 95 lives and over 400 injuries. Hopes are fading for more survivors in the rail car search where it is thought a dozen bodies may yet remain.The train crashed into the side of a nine-story apartment building located nearby a bend where it jumped the track. Relatives of those lost are arriving in Amagasaki to identify loved ones in a gymnasium where a makeshift morgue is located.Police searching for the cause of yesterday’s disaster investigated eight offices of West Japan Railway Co on Tuesday for clues to the rail driver. Police conducting the probe said professional negligence may be involved. The train operator, who in the past received a warning for a similar incident, over-shot the stop at the previous station and had to back the train up nearly 40 m (130 feet).It is unclear whether the inexperienced driver of the train survived, 23-year-old Ryujiro Takami with 11 months on the job.Running late and traveling at what survivors thought was excessive speed, it is believed the train lost control at a bend in the track where 71 km/h (44 mph) was the speed limit; however, any speeds under 134 km/h (83 mph) should not have caused derailment.The train and aircraft disaster research committee, which reports to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, began to research the disaster. The committee members revealed unofficially the physical reasons of the disaster are quite complexe A member of the committee says the speed of train was monitored and at the fifth train it was recoreded that this car had run at 108 km/h speed in a certain moment after emergency brake had worked.A researcher from Holland, Michigan claims to have found an unmarked grave containing human remains from Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501. The airliner vanished over Lake Michigan in 1950 with 55 passengers and three crew.Valerie van Heest says she has discovered that human remains washed ashore after the June 23 crash, the cause of which remains undetermined although severe weather at the time may have had an impact. She says that after the remains appeared they were placed in a mass grave in nearby Riverview Cemetery in St. Joseph without the relatives being notified. The grave was never marked.Both the Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates, who document shipwrecks in the area, and author Clive Cussler have spent years searching for the McDonnell-Douglas DC4 but without success.Van Heest Said of the victims' relatives “After more than a half-century they are still interested in learning what befell their loved ones... One 89-year-old woman in New York lost her mother in the crash. She told me, ’Valerie, please help find her before I die.’ ”A black granite monument engraved with the names of everyone on board has been donated by a funeral home in South Haven. It will be unveiled at a ceremony on September 20. The families of 47 of the 58 victims have been notified of the new developments.Fifteen researchers are planning to take part in a new expedition in an attempt to solve the 70 year-old mystery of Amelia Earhart, a female pilot who disappeared in 1937 after an attempt to fly around the globe.The team will be lead by Ric Gillespie, a researcher at The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, who plans on searching the uninhabited island of Nikumaroro for the remains of Earhart's plane and her navigator, Fred Noonan."You can sit around and write books and kick theories around all day. In the end, in archeology, the ground will tell you the truth," said Gillespie's wife, Pat Thrasher.In 1937, Nikumaroro was known as Garner Island, and Gillespie believes that Earhart's plane crashed on the island while Earhart was trying to fly around the globe in her Lockheed 10E Electra. Earhart was supposed to finish her journey and land on Howland Island, but never arrived, and to this day, no trace of her remains or Noonan's, or of the plane have ever been found, but some remains of skeletons found in 1940, pieces of woman shoes and equipment have been recovered in previous trips to the island and Gillespie says that those remains are consistent with Earhart and what her plane would have been carrying at the time it disappeared.The new expedition is centered around radio distress calls that are said to have been made by Earhart just before her plane went missing, but many researchers consider the transmissions an elaborate hoax. However; Gillespie says that when Earhart's plane ran out of fuel, Nikumaroro Island would have been the closest place to land. Nikumaroro is approximately 2½ miles long, and about 350 miles south of Howland Island. Gillespie says that both Earhart and Noonan would likely have survived "weeks or months" after the crash, but later died of starvation, lack of fresh water, or may have been severely ill.The team hopes to begin the trip at the end of July or early August, not long after July 24, which is the 110th anniversary of Earhart's birth, and coincides with her disappearance on July 2, 1937. The expedition will take approximately 17 days to complete.At least two homes have been evacuated, and 14 or more are on standby to evacuate in Buffalo, New York after a very large three-story building partially collapsed on the city's West Side.According to the Buffalo Fire Department, the number four side of an old horse stable at 428 Jersey Street off of Richmond Avenue collapsed from the roof line half way down the side. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighbouring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape."[The building] is well worth the designation" as a historical landmark, states Tim Tielman of the Buffalo Preservation Board. Tielman states that he will likely bring the incident before the Board as early as Thursday, June 12 to discuss the issue."We don't want to demolish it until it is talked about and we consider options," added Tielman.So far there are no reports of injuries. Firefighters plan on getting an aerial shot to determine if the building is in danger of totally collapsing. A detail will remain on scene until at least Thursday afternoon. The building was first owned by a company called White Bros. and was used as a stable for a farm which once covered the land around the building for several blocks. Servants and workers of the farm were housed inside resident quarters situated at the rear of the building.The building, the current owner of which is not known, covers nearly a half block. Much of the building's sides are home to vines, and a variety of gardens are planted along the perimeter of the building. Residents state that they will be "very disappointed" to see the building be demolished.Repairs on the building were ongoing. The building is believed to have been built in the mid-1800's.Residents in Buffalo, New York fear that demolishing a nearly 200-year-old livery and stable which partially collapsed on Wednesday June 11, could cause an environmental hazard.Wikinews has learned that according property records with the city, the stable was converted into a gasoline station and auto repair shop in 1950, and is designated as a body shop. During that time at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which New York State says is used for "below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage." The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, "excavation and backfill," but did not include "the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring."Property reports give the tanks a 'construction code' of a "C - Average", meaning the tanks were not designed to last for a significant period of time. That rating has residents concerned that the tanks could pose an environmental hazard if they are not properly taken care of.Wikinews has not been able to determine if the tanks have been removed or if they were emptied when the gas station closed sometime in the 1980's. Wikinews has also contacted the city of Buffalo for a comment regarding the tanks, but has yet to receive a response.The building was scheduled for emergency demolition on Thursday June 12, but was stopped by police after residents raised concerns for the safety of those living around the building. According to New York law, since the city ordered the demolition, they are required to perform an 'Environmental Impact Assessment' or SEQR when a project or demolition has the possibility of posing an environmental hazard.According to New York law, a SEQR should be performed "to incorporate the consideration of environmental factors into the existing planning, review and decision-making processes of state, regional and local government agencies at the earliest possible time. To accomplish this goal, SEQR requires that all agencies determine whether the actions they directly undertake, fund or approve may have a significant impact on the environment, and, if it is determined that the action may have a significant adverse impact, prepare or request an environmental impact statement."The law states, "SEQR requires the sponsoring or approving governmental body to identify and mitigate the significant environmental impacts of the activity it is proposing or permitting." It also states that it is the duty of the governmental body in charge of a project to enforce the laws of the SEQR. It also states that agencies must give "appropriate weight with social and economic considerations" when undergoing major projects.The law also allows citizens to enforce the regulation stating, "citizens or groups who can demonstrate that they may be harmed by this failure [SEQR], may take legal action against the agency" or governmental body behind such a project. The court system in New York has been known to "consistently" rule in favor of plaintiffs who file lawsuits against agencies who do not perform a SEQR.Residents won a restraining order to stop demolition after State Supreme Court Justice Judge John. F. O’Donnell signed a temporary injunction. Residents are concerned demolition crews moved too fast, and are not doing enough to protect them and their surrounding properties. They are also concerned that the city did not consider all the options or risks before ordering the building to be demolished.On June 15, Judge Jerome C. Gorski ruled that the city can resume demolition, but "on a limited basis" only to remove fallen rubble that landed on properties, and to remove any loose bricks or material from the building, but not below its truss line. Because of the risk of further collapse, the workers are ordered "to use only hand tools." to remove the loose material and debris. Residents are attempting to save portions of the building's side walls and its facade. The demolition crew began to remove some materials, as ordered by the court on Tuesday, June 17.Judge Gorski also ordered that the plaintiffs present their case in front the State's Supreme Court in Rochester. The hearing took place on Monday morning on June 16 at 10:00 a.m. (eastern time), and the case is currently "being discussed," said an anonymous source close to the lawsuit to Wikinews.Bob Freudenheim is the building's owner who has housing violations against him for neglecting the building. Residents state that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished. According to WGRZ Channel 2 News, in the past three months, Freudenheim has received at least five housing code violations from the city. WGRZ states that the orders, which they obtained, were to fix the building "to a safe condition."Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.Freudenheim has not released a statement, and Wikinews has not been able to contact him regarding the issue.MSNBC translator Jacob Keryakes has stated that the claim of responsibility for the London bombings of July 7, supposedly made by a militant Islamist group, contains an error in one of the Quranic verses that it cites, suggesting that the claim may be phony. "This is not something al-Qaida would do," he said. The claim of responsibility by The Secret Organization of al-Qaida in Europe for the London attacks has also been questioned on the grounds that the rhetoric is not consistent with militant Islamic ideology. The statement asked "the Nation of Islam and the Nation of Arabism to rejoice" about the attacks. According to the Associated Press, Islamic expert Mishari al-Thaidi wrote in an essay published Saturday in the London-based Arabic Asharq Al Awsat newspaper: "What strikes attention here is addressing the Arab nation. The Jihadists have never recognized Arab nationalism. This is close to pan-Arab or Baathist terminology."Richard has become a Category one hurricane with winds of 85 mph (155 kph) according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.It is heading west-northwestward and is expected to make landfall in Belize sometime this evening.Richard is located 95 mi (155 km) east of Belize City, Belize, however it is still dumping heavy rains in Honduras. Sections of the north coast of Honduras, from Limón westward to Puerto Cortes and the Bay Islands including Rotan, Utila and Guanaja, as well as the entire country of Belize are still under a hurricane warning according to the Hurricane Center. A tropical storm warning is also up for east coast of Yucatán Peninsula from Punta Gruesa to Chetumal. The tropical storm warning and watch are discontinued for areas east of Limón eastward to the Honduras/Nicaragua border.The Hurricane Center is warning people residing in hurricane warning areas to brace for hurricane conditions by this evening and to rush all preparations to completion. The first bands of Richard brining tropical storm forced winds are expected to arrive within twelve to eighteen hours. Hurricane force winds extend 15 mi (30 km) from the center, while topical storm force winds extend 105 mi (165 km).The hurricane is expected to plow through Belize and Mexico before emerging into the Bay of Campeche as a depression. The depression could pose a threat to oil rigs in the Bay of Campeche. Full Wikinews coverage of the 2010 hurricane seasonRichard Hammond, a British television presenter known for presenting shows such as Top Gear and Brainiac, is in a "stable" condition in hospital following a car accident during filming for Top Gear.  He was injured when the jet-powered car he was driving crashed during filming for the former.  The car, similar to the "Vampire" which holds the British land speed record, overturned whilst being driven at speeds of up to 300 miles per hour at Elvington airfield near York, in what was suggested to be an attempt at bettering the previous record. It has been suggested that he succeeded in a previous attempt. Emergency services were called to the scene at 5.45pm local time (16.45 UTC).He was airlifted to the specialist neurological unit at Leeds General Infirmary.  A former firefighter who was providing fire safety at the site and witnessed the accident said that Hammond was initially unconscious but able to speak when removed from the wreckage.  At the time he indicated some pain in his lower back.  Numerous eyewitnesses from the Top Gear crew claimed he was 'helped into' an air ambulance, suggesting he was conscious at the time.  The ambulance service is reported to have said that Hammond was unconscious when they arrived at the scene, but began to regain consciousness upon arrival at the hospital.The car was "very very badly damaged and in many pieces on the runway", according to BBC News 24, reporting comments made by his colleagues. A web sitehas been set up for well-wishers enabling them to donate to the Yorkshire Air Ambulance.  This site will accept donations until January 21, 2007. As of 23.09 (UTC) 21st September 2006 (day 2) £52,239.90 had been raised, surpassing the original target of £340.00 and well past their target of £51,000 (150 flights) that was set in the past few days.Wikinews has learned that Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU Project, is confirmed to be safe in Peru after a massive 8.0 earthquake struck the country on August 15. It was earlier reported that he may have been missing.According to e-mails and forum posts obtained by Wikinews, Stallman was traveling from Lima to Chimbote with a man named Mario Ramos on August 15, when the quake struck and was expected to arrive in Chimbote on Monday August 20. He later arrived in Trujillo, Peru where he 'checked-in.'"Richard Stallman is now in Trujillo, this I confirm it and tomorrow he will be [at the] conference," said Edward Vega Gavidia in an e-mail obtained by Wikinews.The possibility of Stallman missing was first announced at approximately 6:43 p.m. (eastern time) when a user by the name of RichiH posted a 'wallop' to users on the Freenode IRC network stating "hi all. As you will surely have heard, there was a major earthquake in Peru. It seems Richard 'RMS' Stallmann [sic] was traveling from Lima to Chimbote with Mario Ramos on August 15th and no one has heard from him since."Wikinews contacted the GNU Project and Stallman by e-mail, and Stallman confirmed that he is indeed safe."I was in Lima, where there was little damage. I was at the Universidad Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, in the office of COSOLIG, the university's free software group. When the building started to shake, I realized it was an earthquake, and also that it wasn't strong enough to be dangerous. The other people were much more worried, and urged me to go outside with them, so I did. The shaking continued for surprisingly long, but there was no damage," said Stallman in an e-mail to Wikinews.A riot at Sydney's Villawood Detention Centre continued Thursday with six protesters remaining on the roof after the centre was set alight Wednesday night in a protest involving up to 100 detainees. Nobody has been injured in the protest.Nine demountable buildings were destroyed in the blaze, described as an "act of desperation" from asylum-seekers held at the centre for up to two years. Firefighters were pelted with roof tiles and other debris as they struggled to contain the fire. The protest began early Wednesday, sparked by two men climbing onto the roof of the building. The remaining detainees are sitting on the roof with a large sign that reads "We need help." According to one protestor, further violence is unlikely to occur, but they will continue to stay on the roof.Riot police were seen entering the building at approximately 9.30 a.m. AEST.Villawood has been the site of much recent controversy, with a similar protest taking place in September last year following the death of a Fijian detainee, and a second death in November that led to a hunger strike at the centre.Many rivers in the Czech Republic, Austria, and Slovakia are flooding, while record amounts of snow rapidly melt in the mountains. Extreme levels of flood danger were announced in at least 70 places. Currently the worst situations are near headwaters, such as in the town Veselí on the river Lužnice or in Třebíč. Yesterday a 5 year old boy from Boňov died.The Czech capital, Prague, is preparing for the flood and flood defences are being set up along Vltava shores. Many locals are watching the rising river, remembering the catastrophic floods of 2002. Currently a quarter of the record  flow of 2002 is flowing in Vltava. Further development depends on weather - if the melting does not combine with heavy rains, the floods are not expected to cause catastrophic damage.A World Health Organisation study published in The Lancet has revealed the main causes of death for people aged 10–24.  It has described the majority of these deaths as preventable and suggested solutions to the problems.97% of the 2.6 million fatalities annually occur in low- and middle-income countries.  The age group comprises 1.8 billion people, 30% of the total population.  15% of female deaths were down to "maternal mortality" which included pregnancy complications, unsafe abortions, and mutilation of genitals. Road traffic accidents accounted for 10% of deaths.6.3% of the deaths were suicides and 6% were down to violence. Tuberculosis and similar lung infections took 10% of the lives and HIV/AIDS killed 5.5%.  Most of the deaths were in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.  Africa and Southeast Asia were also the only places where male deaths were not above those of females, as much of the maternal mortality occurred there.  The data came from 2004.In developed countries, 32% of the deaths were down to road accidents. "There has long been an assumption that young people are healthy, fit and they don't die," explained the report's lead author, Australian children's health expert George Patton. He goes on to say "I've certainly heard politicians and policy-makers make statements of that kind... Some of these problems, related to emotion, are actually very prominent causes not only of death in adolescence, but health problems later in life."The study said safer speed limits, more use of helmets and seatbelts, and better enforcement of drunk driving law could greatly curb the road deaths.  Maternal deaths and sexually transmitted disease rates could be cut by sexual education, safe abortion clinics, pregnancy support, HIV testing and treatment, and access to contraceptives.Violence and suicide could be reduced by education in life skills and an improved role of parents, the study found.  It also sought reduction of availability of poisons, firearms, and other dangerous items.  In the case of suicide, the study said more work was needed to help young people recover from acts of violence, sexual assault, and child abuse in both the short and long term.  Alcohol access reduction was also requested.The study was conducted by University College London's Russell Viner, World Health Organization's Krishna Bose and George Patton of the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia.Local government officials have said that at least eleven people were killed on Sunday in southern Afghanistan by a roadside bomb.The governor's spokesman, Daud Ahmadi, said to media that "a civilian car struck a roadside bomb in Nawzad District." According to the spokesman, a family was riding on a tractor with a truck-bed hitched on back, when it hit the explosives on a central road; all of the people aboard died, including two children and two women.Ahmadi blamed the attack on the Taleban.The incident comes several weeks after soldiers from the US, NATO, and Afghanistan, initiated an offensive against the Taleban in Helmand's Marjah and Nad Ali areas on February 13.According to NATO, one of its service members has died from a bomb attack at an army base in southern Afghanistan. In addition, an Afghan soldier reportedly died and the blast left three others injured.The International Security Assistance Force released a statement yesterday, saying that "[the soldier] died today following an explosion at an Afghan National Army facility in Kabul." An anonymous official said that the blast occurred when a mortar fuse exploded while a training exercise was underway.  The Taliban claimed responsibility for the incident, saying that an infiltrator had caused the explosion.This latest death brings the total death toll of foreign soldiers in 2010 to 166 in Afghanistan.The last deaths reported by NATO were of two Dutch soldiers killed Saturday by a roadside bomb in the Uruzgan province. The Netherlands' Defense Ministry said a third Dutch soldier had been seriously wounded in that attack.The Afghan Ministry of Defence yesterday made the announcement that two soldiers who came from the United Kingdom had been killed in two explosions in the country. Both soldiers came from 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment.The two were on foot patrol near the town of Malgir, in Helmand Province when two explosions caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) killed both yesterday. This incident increases the total number of British military personnel killed in Afghanistan since 2001 to 253. At present, no further information is being released about the two soldiers. Their next of kin have been notified.Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield, the spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said, "[i]t is with deep sadness I must inform you that IEDs claimed the lives of two British soldiers this morning in the Malgir area of Central Helmand, an area between Babaji and Gereshk. The soldiers were on a foot patrol when the explosions happened. Two of our comrades, taken from us in the course of their duty, whose resolute bravery and sacrifice we will remember."The rocket carrying NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory has crashed, sending the remains of the atmosphere observation satellite into the ocean off the coast of Antarctica. Shortly before the crash, the 'payload fairing' failed to deploy from the craft."Several minutes into the flight of the Taurus rocket carrying NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory spacecraft, launch managers declared a contingency after the payload fairing failed to separate," said NASA in a statement on their website. "The spacecraft did not reach orbit and likely landed in the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica". The cause of the failure to deploy and the crash are still under investigation."A Mishap Investigation Board will be immediately convened to determine the cause of the launch failure," added the statement.Steve Cole, a spokesperson for NASA told Bloomberg L.P., "the mission is lost. At this point no one is exactly sure what the cause is". The rocket that would have carried the observatory into space, a Taurus XL, took off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in the United States, at approximately 4:55 a.m. EST. Approximately 10 minutes into the mission, the payload failed to separate and a contingency was activated, but was unsuccessful.The Orbiting Carbon Observatory was the latest mission in NASA's ongoing study of the global carbon cycle. It would have been the first spacecraft dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide, the most significant human-produced greenhouse gas and the principal human-produced driver of climate change. The cost of the project was US$273 million.Afghan officials have said that a rocket apparently fired at a luxury hotel in Kabul injured four people today, despite falling short of its target.An Interior Ministry spokesman, Zamary Bashary, told the Voice of America news agency the rocket exploded on a road between a hospital and the Serena Hotel, which is in the center of the capital, near the presidential palace, government ministries and embassies. The incident happened at about 18.15 local time (13.45 UTC)."It was a rocket that hit in front of the Rabia Balkhi hospital. We have four wounded, three are civilians and one is a police officer," said Zamarai Bashary, a spokesman for the interior ministry, as quoted by the Agence France-Presse news agency.Taliban militants fired rockets at the same hotel last month, which is heavily guarded.  No one was injured in that attack, which came on the same day that a suicide-bomb explosion killed five UN staff members and two Afghans at their quarters in another part of Kabul.Taliban militants also attacked the Serena Hotel in January 2008, in a commando-style assault that killed at least eight people.Insurgents in eastern Afghanistan fired rockets into a marketplace on Monday, killing ten civilians in an area where French armed forces were meeting with tribal elders.French and Afghan officials said the attack, which was in the town of Tagab in the Kapisa province, wounded at least 28 people. Two rockets hit the market as the commander of French troops in eastern Afghanistan, General Marcel Druart, was meeting tribal chiefs nearby."The Taliban fired the rockets from Badrab, where they have a base. They are strong there," said deputy police chief Haji Mohammed Akbar. French and US medical teams evacuated the wounded by helicopter to hospitals for treatment. No French personnel were reported hurt.The French commander attended the gathering of tribal elders, known as a "shura," as part of NATO efforts to win the trust of Afghan civilians in a region with a strong Taliban presence. French troops have been fighting the Taliban northeast of the capital, Kabul, to try to secure towns and roads threatened by the militants.Chilean filmmaker Rodrigo Ortúzar, known for his film Mujeres Infieles, announced his plans to make a film about the Chilean miners trapped in the 2010 Copiapó mining accident.After it was confirmed the miners were alive, Ortúzar started to work on the project. The movie is to be named Los 33 (English: The 33). "I said to one of my previous investors that if there was just one survivor, this would be a great movie, and well it wasn't one but 33, something that generates the first disgrace or tragedy to have a happy ending," Ortúzar told to Teletrece.Ortúzar is already filming in Copiapó. This footage will be mixed with the dramatization. The movie is to be officially filmed in 2011, and will be released in theatres in 2012.A motorist was injured during a collision that resulted in a rollover in the city of Naperville, Illinois, United States. The accident occurred at about 8:15 am (13:15 UTC) on the interchange of Illinois Route 59 and Interstate 88.Naperville police reported that Pavitra Durgam, a 26-year-old from Chicago, was traveling southbound on Route 59 and tried to turn left onto the ramp to Interstate 88. In doing so, she cut in front of a car heading north on Route 59. The other, currently unidentified driver swerved to avoid her, hit a curb, and collided with her car anyway. Northbound traffic on Route 59 north of Diehl Road, including the entrance into eastbound Interstate 88, was blocked as crews cleaned up the area of the collision. The unidentified motorist complained of back pain and was thus sent to nearby Edward Hospital. Durgam received a citation for failing to yield to oncoming traffic as she turned.Officials said at least 27 people are dead and 155 injured after pyrotechnic effects used at the Colectiv nightclub in Bucharest, Romania reportedly malfunctioned yesterday, sparking a fire.The club was hosting an album launch party which attracted hundreds of attendees at the time of the fire. As of this morning, some people thought to be attending the nightclub were still unaccounted for.A witness told local media that pyrotechnics used in the club ignited nearby objects. The Facebook page for the album launch event said "customized light show and pyrotechnic effects" were to be used at the scene.A crush occurred as people flocked to exits in an attempt to flee from the nightclub. A witness interviewed by Reuters said "there was a stampede of people running out of the club."On the Facebook page for the album launch event, users who believed people they knew may have been attending the event posted questions asking about where their friends or family members were. Many victims of the fire did not carry any form of identification with them. The Government has set up a hotline for those whose friends or family members are believed to have been at the club.President of Romania Klaus Iohannis said on Facebook he was "shocked and deeply saddened" ((ro))Romanian language: ‍cutremurat și profund îndurerat by the incident.As many as four leaks have been detected in the Deepwater Horizon well cap in the Gulf of Mexico, according to live footage shot by one of BP's ROVs (Remote Operated Vehicles). The leaks were detected early this morning, just after 4:00 (EDT).The HOS SUPER H ROV 1 made the discovery while performing an "integrity survey" of the well and well cap. It recorded what appears to be a thin metal pipe lining the outside of the oil cap. Four small leaks of what appear to oil bubbles were detected during this survey. The first appears just after the elbow connecting the pipe to the two green pipes. The second can be seen through the hole of the large metal ring. The third is seen just to the right of the metal ring.It is not yet known what the pipe carries or what it connects to.  It is also not yet clear if all leaks are from the pipe, or leaking from the well.  BP confirmed the leaks and told Wikinews in a phone call to their Houston, Texas press office, there is a "small leak" releasing hydrates consisting of gases and oil.  They are "studying the issue" and are prepared to fix the pipe if it becomes an issue.  Live camera feeds show hydrocarbons building up as the oil and gas leak from the pipe.On July 18, ROV cameras showed bubbles coming from the base of well. BP said it would test the bubbles to determine what they are and as of Sunday, COO of BP Doug Suttles says the bubbles are not methane, but further tests are being conducted. "If you can imagine, it is not an easy operation to collect those bubbles so that they can be tested to see what their make-up is."Yesterday an unnamed United States official told the Associated Press that there was "seepage" coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head. The official said the seepage and methane gas were discovered near the Deepwater well head, but did not specify an exact location. Admiral Thad Allen, a former US Coast Guard admiral who is overseeing the spill efforts for the US government said yesterday in a letter to BP that ROVs "detected seep a distance from the well and undetermined anomalies at the well head." So far there is no word what those substances are, but BP says the bubbles detected on July 18 are not of a hydrocarbon nature."When seeps are detected, you are directed to marshal resources, quickly investigate, and report findings to the government in no more than four hours," said Allen in his letter to BP. During a press conference today, Allen confirmed seepage about 3km from the well point. He could not specify whether the seep was related to the capping of the well or if it is naturally occurring.On June 13 the Viking Poseidon ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) 1 recorded oil and methane seeping from the seafloor at around 2:48 a.m.. The ROV monitors the seep for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot. Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled. After an investigation, Wikinews determined that the seepage was located just over 50 feet from the Deepwater leak point. BP has denied that any oil or methane gas is leaking from the sea floor.  On July 16, Kent Wells, the senior vice president of the company, said on their official Twitter page that "4 ROVs using sonar scanning [are] looking for anomalies in seabed floor.  No indications any oil or gas escaping."BP issued a press release earlier this morning, but did not state information regarding any leaks or seepage from the well. BP did say that the well cap "measured at approximately 6,792 pounds per square inch and continues to rise slowly."The Deepwater Horizon oil spill started on April 20 after an explosion on the rig. Efforts to put out the fire failed and the rig subsequently sank to the bottom of the Gulf. On April 22, an oil slick appeared on the surface of the Gulf. BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf. The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap since it stopped the flow of oil. BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI. As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI. BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor.At approximately 06:00 a.m. (00:30 GMT) Wednesday, between four and seven people were killed when an Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) passenger train crashed into a stationary freight train at Vyasarpadi Jeeva station, in Chennai, India. Between eleven and twenty persons were injured, and rushed to General Hospital in Chennai. Officials are unsure of the number of persons aboard the passenger train, which was operated by an unknown person. "It is not clear who operated (it)," said S. Jayanth, acting general manager of Southern Railway. The operator of the EMU train was not in the train when it left 15 minutes to half an hour before the scheduled departure time. It is said some passengers did board the passenger train.The EMU train ignored all signals, and drove about 7 kilometers (4 mi) at high speed, jumping tracks, before colliding with the goods train.The driver of the goods train, Arumugam, has been confirmed as one of those who has died.  The goods train was traveling between  Arakkonam to Chennai. The motorman, guard and assistant jumped from the goods train sustaining fractures."We heard a loud noise and saw several compartments in flames. The smell emanating from bodies from the mangled coaches was nauseating," said M.N. Selvi, a nearby resident.The platforms at the Vyasarpadi Jeeva station were destroyed, and electrical cables were torn down. The EMU train caught fire in the collision destroying two compartments completely. The other compartments were thrown from the tracks.  The freight train was loaded with oil tanks, however reports indicate that only the EMU train was set ablaze.All train services were canceled for a time on one of the busiest rail lines of India.  "Train services are disrupted due to the mishap but we hope to restore the services in two to three hours time," an Indian Railways spokesperson.Railways Minister Lalu Prasad announced that an inquiry will be held.A London Underground engineering train ran away and travelled four miles on the Underground's Northern Line early on Friday morning, resulting in part of the Northern Line, which carries 500,000 passengers daily, being closed for much of the day. The runaway train apparently had an engineering defect.The London Underground, also known as the Tube, reported that the engineering train had been working on the High Barnet branch of the Northern Line when it broke down at 5.25 a.m. BST (0425 UTC). It was attached to an out-of-service passenger train to be dragged northwards when, for reasons which are being investigated by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, it broke free near Archway station at 6.44 a.m. and started rolling southwards. The train ran through six stations before it was finally brought to a halt by a slight incline in the track at Warren Street at 6.57 a.m.Passenger Tom Redfern, on the preceding train at Archway, described what happened to the BBC:  "As soon as we pulled away the driver came on the tannoy and said, 'There is an emergency, will everyone move towards the front of the train'. There was a ripple of panic. I went from half asleep to a big adrenaline rush. I thought, 'Is this it?'"The passenger train was rerouted onto the City Branch of the Northern Line, and bypassed all stations until Moorgate in an attempt to keep ahead of the runaway, while the runaway was routed down the Charing Cross Branch.Mr Redfern said: "We went full speed. We knew the situation was dangerous because we were going fast. Even by the driver's voice, we could tell it was serious."London Underground director Richard Parry said that at no time was the runaway closer than 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) to a passenger train. Service was suspended between Finchley Central and Archway, and between Camden Town and Kennington via Charing Cross, while investigations into the cause of the runaway took place.A 12-year-old girl has died after the car they were travelling in slipped on ice and rolled off the side of the road near Darfield, Canterbury.A Westpac Rescue Helicopter was also at the scene to offer services and help. Two were taken to hospital for a check up.State highway 77 was closed while the scene was cleared up, creating a detour along Zigzag road. It reopened at 5.00 p.m. (NZST).Firefighters in the Australian state of Victoria continue to battle blazes across rural Victoria which threaten up to 25 communities. Major fires of concern are near the Grampians National Park, La Trobe Valley and Gippsland.The Grampians fire has destroyed 24 homes so far. Soaring temperatures and winds up to 50 km/h have fanned the Grampians blaze.American radio host and conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh and televangelist Pat Robertson have drawn criticism from the White House for comments made on Thursday criticizing the relief efforts for Haiti following Tuesday's earthquake there. When asked by a caller on his radio show about the president urging Americans to contribute to the Red Cross to help those affected, Limbaugh responded, "Would you trust that the money is going to go to Haiti? Would you trust that your name is going to instead end up on a mailing list for the Obama people to start asking you for campaign donations for him and other causes?""Besides," Limbaugh added, "We've already donated to Haiti.  It's called the U.S. income tax."Limbaugh went on to say that the American president "runs around the world apologizing for" the United States, and that "he now turns to us as its president and asks people who have lost their jobs because of his policies to donate to WhiteHouse.gov to the people of Haiti, and we will do it.  We are the most charitable and the most generous people on the face of the earth.  Each and every time a natural disaster like this happens, we step up. We are there. We have yet another crisis simply too good to waste.  This will play right into Obama's hands. He's humanitarian, compassionate. They'll use this to burnish their, shall we say, 'credibility' with the black community—in the both light-skinned and dark-skinned black community in this country. It's made-to-order for them. That's why he couldn't wait to get out there, could not wait to get out there."Robertson's remarks on Thursday were also considered to be inflammatory when he suggested on his television show, The 700 Club that the current situation in Haiti is a direct result of a deal Haitians made with Satan in the late 1700s. Robertson stated that the Haitian people in that time, "were under the heel of the French, uh, you know Napoleon the 3rd and whatever, and they got together and swore a pact to the Devil. They [the Haitian leaders] said, 'We will serve you [Satan] if you'll get us free from the French.' True story. And so the Devil said, 'Okay, it's a deal.’ And, uh, they kicked the French out, you know, with the Haitians revolted and got themselves free. But ever since they have been cursed by, by one thing after another, desperately poor. That island of Hispaniola is one island. It's cut down the middle. On the one side is Haiti on the other side is the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is, is prosperous, healthy, full of resorts, etcetera. Haiti is in desperate poverty. Same island. They need to have and we need to pray for them a great turning to God and out of this tragedy I'm optimistic something good may come. But right now we're helping the suffering people and the suffering is unimaginable."When asked about these two statements during his press briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs replied to them both respectively, "In times of great crisis, there are always people that say really stupid things. I don't know how anybody could sit where [they] do, having enjoyed the success that [they have], and not feel some measure of sorrow for what has happened in Haiti. I think to use the power of your pulpit to try to convince those not to help their brothers and sisters is sad.  My sense is that most people, though, because they understand we're part of an amazing world, won't listen and instead will seek to help those that they know, because it is through no fault of their own, have suffered an unspeakable tragedy."Chris Roslan, spokesperson for the network that broadcasts Robertson's show defended the remarks stating, "Dr. Robertson never stated that the earthquake was God's wrath. If you watch the entire video segment, Dr. Robertson's compassion for the people of Haiti is clear. He called for prayer for them."Rush Limbaugh and the radio network that carries his show still have yet to reply to the criticism from The White House and elsewhere.Russia has admitted to and apologised for a violation of Finland's airspace with a strategic airlifter last week.A Russian Ilyushin Il-76 cargo jet spent around three minutes in Finnish airspace near Porvoo, penetrating about 4.5 kilometers into restricted airspace on September 14.Prime Minister of Finland Matti Vanhanen responded to the incident by saying that such violations must not happen, and demanding an explanation from Russia. According to discussions on Thursday between Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian ambassador to Finland, and Finnish Foreign Minister Ilkka Kanerva, the incident was fully investigated by Russia. Russia has described it as an accident, and says that the conclusion of their investigations was that the incursion occurred because of a breakdown in communication between the crew of the Il-76 and air traffic control. This was caused by technical problems.Russia has proposed expert talks with Finland and Estonia to attempt to prevent future incidents of this nature. Kanerva has expressed his satisfaction with the explanation and approval of the idea of specialist discussions.It has been unveiled that aircraft operating at or near a major Russian airport, the Moscow Sheremetyevo International Airport, have for about four years been at high risk of bird strikes because of a high number of birds nesting nearby on a large, illegal landfill site. Prominent Russian social activist Alexey Navalny, whose anti-corruption campaigns are nowadays largely discussed on the Internet in Russia and general press, on Friday published a LiveJournal post with the details on the case.Navalny, among other things, references the recent writings in the LiveJournal blog of the airport's Director General Mikhail Vasilenko, who has publicly expressed concerns about the birds near the airport. He says that, since the landfill came into existence, there have been 141 instances of planes hitting birds while flying near the airport and 21 instances at the airfield during takeoff and landing operations. Bird strikes are a common problem in aviation that can lead to equipment damage and human casualties.It has been reported that, for a long time, airport administration and groups of local citizens concerned with the landfill have been appealing to different Moscow Oblast and Russian Federation authorities to address the problem, but almost nothing has been done to close the landfill due to obstacles in local governing and commerical systems. It has been emphasized that the existence of the landfill in question is not officially permitted, and as such, the landfill is operating illegally.As reported by Navalny, the only thing state authorities could recently accomplish, was a temporary suspension of trash transportation during May 7–12, when many world leaders came to Moscow through Sheremetyevo—historically the state's main civil airport—to celebrate Russia's 65th Victory Day. That was made possible only with the interference of Federal Protective Service, the state service which protects top Russian officials.Yesterday, at least four were killed and eleven were injured near the Slavyansky Bulvar Metro station in Moscow, Russia, after a bus ran down the steps at the entrance, officials stated. According to an emergency services source reported through state news media, fifteen were injured, and five died in the incident.The incident happened in an icy situation. The bus drove onto the pavement and down the steps leading to the station. The police reportedly arrested the driver. News agencies reported the driver was not under the influence of alcohol. The driver told investigators the bus suddenly moved, and although he tried to stop it, the brakes did not work. A reported emergency services source said the accident might be due to brake failure.According to Interfax news agency, the bus was less than a year old. Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin said he had ordered all Moscow buses to be inspected.The American civilian communications satellite Iridium 33 and the defunct Russian military communications satellite Kosmos-2251 collided over Siberia on Tuesday, according to NASA. The satellites, each weighing in excess of 1,000 pounds, and traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour, collided 491 miles above the earth.The Iridium satellite was launched in 1997, and the Russian satellite was a Strela-2M model. The American satellite is expected to be replaced within the coming month as Iridium will maneuver one of its in-orbit satellites to replace the lost unit.Although the first such satellite crash in space, such an event has been long predicted. Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist of NASA's Orbital Debris Office at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center stated, "We knew this was going to happen eventually and this is it — this was the big one." While the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope are at minimal risk, the event does raise concerns that the debris cloud could collide with other satellites in the region, triggering an exponentially growing series of collisions and debris known as an ablation cascade. The United States Strategic Command of the U.S. Department of Defense office is tracking the debris. The result of plotting analysis will be posted to a public website.File:Aeroflot-Nord VP-BKO Boeing 737-500.jpgAccording to Russian officials, an Aeroflot-Nord, Flight 821, a Boeing 737-500 crashed near the city of Perm at 3:15 a.m. local time with 88 people aboard, all feared to have been killed. There were six crew and 82 passengers from 21 different nations including seven children and one baby on board the plane. Reuters quotes the Ekho Moskvy (Echo of Moscow) radio station in Russia that all on board were dead.The plane took off at 1:12 a.m. local time and was traveling from Moscow to Perm when officials at the Bolshoye Savino Airport lost contact with the aircraft at about 1,800 meters in altitude. The plane crashed just outside the airport, while on final approach to land. One report says it crashed into a ravine while another states it crashed into a swampy area. Wreckage is reported to cover nearly 3 sq mi (4 km2). The wreckage burst into flames and one Russian report says the pilots tried to avoid hitting residential homes that were near the scene. The plane's wreckage was found a short time after the crash. Part of the main Trans-Siberian Railway line was damaged as a result of the crash and has been closed."We have found the aircraft. It came down within the city limits (in Perm) in a patch of waste ground. Initial reports are of no casualties on the ground," said the Emergencies Ministries who also said that there was "no damage or deaths on the ground."Witnesses in apartments near the crash describe it as sounding like a "war [had] started", followed by a "huge flames." One witness reports that the plane was at a 30 to 40 degree angle when it smashed into the terrain.The aircraft, registered as number VP-BKO, was sixteen years old, originally operated by Xiamen Airlines.Officials are currently investigating the cause of the crash, but Sky News in Australia reports that there is no indication that terrorism was involved. TIME reports that officials have located the plane's two black boxes and are analyzing the information.This is said to be Russia's worst commercial air disaster since August 2006 when 170 people died after a Tupolev Tu-154 passenger jet, flight 612, owned by St. Petersburg-based Pulkovo Airlines, crashed in the Ukraine. An investigation concluded that it had been hit by lightning.A Russian charter bus collided with a local transit bus near the town of Gagnef in Sweden. At least five passengers were seriously injured, with many others sustaining minor injuries. Rumours also stated that there had been one fatality, but the local authorities claimed that this information is incorrect.The accident occurred on Highway 70 near Gagnef when a local transit bus was leaving a road-side bus stop and was hit by a chartered Russian bus. As a result of the collision the roof of the charter bus was partially sheared off. At the time of the accident the vehicles were carrying a total of about 60 persons, 20 of whom were children.The accident occurred after midnight local time on January 3, 2008. The cause remains unclear. According to the officials the accident area had received a thick snow cover and the roads in the vicinity were icy.A Kamov-32 fire-fighting helicopter has crashed while trying to fill its water tanks, reports the Turkish Anatolian News agency. The crew was reported to be in good condition.Since mid-August, the forest fires have swept the Southern part of Turkey including popular tourist destinations like Bodrum and Antalya-Kas. Lately the General Directorate for Forestry has sent short text messages through Turkish operators for citizens to be aware of forest fires. Amid warnings another fire started in Kas during the weekend.The latest fire in Kas was taken under control with the help from fire helicopters, where the Kamof-32 type Russian fire helicopter has crashed while filling its tanks with water from nearby Lake Gombe. Three Russian citizens working with the team, a Turkish pilot and a Turkish engineer have reported to be fine and in good condition in Gombe Health Center.The Russian Beriev 200 airplane leased to the Portuguese Government suffered an accident last Thursday (July 6) afternoon, after one of its engines was damaged.The accident occurred after a refueling operation at the dam of Aguieira, near Santa Comba Dão. As the aerial firefighting aircraft took off at the end of the refueling maneuver in the water - designated as 'scooping' - its "left wing hit the top of the trees and the aircraft suffered some damage" to its fuselage, said Colonel Anacleto dos Santos, director of the Cabinet of Prevention and Investigation of Accidents with Aircraft (GPIAA), to the Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manhã.While hitting the top of the trees, leaves and some wood entered the left engine, which didn't blow up, but that had to be turned off and the pilot was forced to release fuel for safety reasons. The release of the fuel started small wildfires across the area, reaching some houses, which were quickly extinguished by firefighters and helitack units of the GNR's Intervention, Protection and Rescue Group.The airplane was able to do an emergency landing at the Monte Real Air Base, where it's currently operating from, thanks to the flight experience of one of the Russian pilots. When contacted by the Lusa news agency, National Service of Firefighters and Civil Protection, vice-president Lieutenant-Colonel Joaquim Leitão explained that the repairs will be made by the aircraft company and that all the parts necessary to repair the damages will have to come from Russia, by which the solution for the problem will take "some days".Lieutenant-Colonel Leitão added that an investigation is in progress to analyse the circumstances under which the accident occurred. And when he was asked if the accident was caused by the limitations of the dam, given the dimensions of the aircraft, he said that the reconnaissance of the area had been performed before the scooping exercises began, and an operation officially kicks off when all the conditions are met.The final report of the GPIAA will only be concluded in a few weeks but GPIAA director, Colonel Anacleto dos Santos, excluded two of the eventual causes of any aerial accident. "The atmospheric conditions were not adverse and there are no indications of mechanical failure. Everything points to human error."On board of the aircraft followed two Russian pilots - one of them still receiving formation - and an Portuguese pilot that was observing the operations.Two years ago, the Italian authorities tested the Beriev in the same mission type. Having the Portuguese Government sent observers to evaluate the performance of the aircraft. However, some limitations were found in the performing of the Russian aircraft in Italy's wildfire scenarios. Having the Italian Civil Protection reached the conclusion that the Beriev 200 is not prepared to operate in mountainous terrain.A Russian plane has crashed in the Ukraine killing all 170 passengers on board, according to the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry. The Tu-154 passenger jet owned by St. Petersburg-based Pulkovo Airlines flight number 612 had a roster that included at least 45 children and 11 crew members onboard. It crashed in eastern Ukraine at approximately 2:30 p.m. near the Russian border. A distress signal is reported to have gone off moments before the crash. The plane was on its way to St. Petersburg from Anapa. Wreckage and many bodies have been found.Ukrainian officials are reporting at least 160 people onboard with at least 10 crew members on hand. According to Russian officials, terrorism did not play a role in the crash and that the aircraft may have encountered heavy turbulence which caused the plane to go down. The plane then caught fire after hitting the ground and breaking into several pieces.Other reports say that the plane was "hit by lightning.""The plane most likely was hit by lightning. There was no damage on the ground. After it fell, it broke apart and burst into flames," said Irina Andriyanova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry.Reports say that there are no survivors and at least 30 bodies have been recovered.Eleven people are dead after a military cargo jet crashed in Siberia. The strategic airlifter, which belonged to Russia's Interior Ministry, came down shortly after takeoff in Mirny. There were no survivors.No-one on the ground was injured by the Ilyushin Il-76, which lost control after it failed to gain altitude, banking hard to the right before hitting the ground two kilometers away near a disused mine.  The plane did not achieve a height of beyond 20–30 meters.The aircraft had been headed to Irkutsk and was being operated by interior troops. An inquiry was established to investigate. The Il-76 has been a major component of both the Russian and Soviet military since the 1970s, and had already seen a serious accident in Russia last month. On October 7 an engine separated on takeoff, without injuries. Russia briefly grounded Il-76s after that accident.An oil depot in Russia is burning after an explosion at the facility near the Caspian Sea in Dagestan. A female worker has been hospitalised with burns covering her entire body.A 10,000 tonne oil reservoir has been burning since the explosion at 4:10 p.m. local time (13:10 GMT). Eyewitnesses describe thick plumes of smoke rising from the area.At least 20 fire engines are using foam to try and quench the blaze. Dagestan's Emergencies Minister Murtazali Gadzhiyev went on Russia's Vesti-24 channel to discuss the current situation. "We managed to open the taps ... and now this oil is being pumped out," Gadzhiyev said. "We are trying to keep the fire away from other reservoirs."A plane built by Russia's Sukhoi has crashed in Indonesia with around 50 people on board during a demonstration flight to potential customers. The Superjet 100 struck a cliff as it descended over mountains near Jakarta.The aircraft departed Halim Perdanakusuma Airport at around 2pm local time yesterday and was due to return 50 minutes later. A search and rescue mission was dispatched to West Java, where the aircraft crashed in the Salak mountain range. Bad weather and nightfall initially hampered rescue efforts but a helicopter found the crash site after dawn.Everything reportedly was normal that day on a preflight check and earlier demonstration flight. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev today ordered an investigation into the accident, while Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono today said "I expect that there will be a full and careful investigation".Those on board include journalists, Russian diplomats, and representatives of prospective customer airlines. The flight crew had requested permission for a descent from 10,000ft to 6,000ft shortly before contact was lost. It struck a 7,000ft mountain and the reason for the descent is not immediately apparent. The jet was touring Asia on a sales promotion with stops including Pakistan, Vietnam, Laos, Kazakhstan, and Burma.With a maiden flight in 2008, several Superjet 100s are in service and Sukhoi boasts orders for about 200 more. The first newly-designed post-Soviet Russian airliner, a commercial offering by military planemaker Sukhoi, it seats around 100 and retails for US$31.7 million. This is cheaper than products from Canada; and Sukhoi has sought the services of Western firms including Thales of France and Finmeccanica of Italy, potentially mitigating safety fears about Soviet-era technology.Sukhoi's top test pilot, Alexander Yablontsev, and co-pilot Alexander Kochetkov reportedly were due to be at the controls of the crashed plane. The exact number on board is reported as being from 44 to 50. Sukhoi Civil Aircraft boss Vladimir Prisyazhnyuk said the flight carried eight, including technical staff, from Russia; two from Italy; and one each from France and the United States. The wreckage is in small pieces and, following unconfirmed reports saying bodies were seen, a search team reported no survivors found but several corpses.So far, Aeroflot of Russia and Armavia of Armenia are the only airlines to have brought the jet into service. Mexico has recently given approval to the plane, allowing Western operator Interjet to join the Russian airlines before year's end. Sukhoi hopes to scale up production, presently below planned levels, and already has firm deals in place in Asia including with Kartika Airlines of Indonesia.Police in Russia say they have identified the man behind the bombing of Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport on Monday, although they will not yet name him. Police said the man who killed 35 was a twenty-year-old suicide bomber from the North Caucasus region.An Investigative Committee statement delivered by spokesman Vladimir Markin said "We have established the identity of the terrorist suicide bomber who set off the explosive. He turned out to be a 20-year-old native from one of the North Caucasus republics," and "Despite the investigation having established the name of the terrorist, we will not name him today," because it may hamper ongoing efforts to detain people suspected of collaborating. Markin added "I  would especially like to note that it was by no means an accident that the act of terror was committed in the international arrivals hall... According to investigators, the act of terror was first and foremost aimed against foreign citizens." Eight of those killed were foreigners and several flights had just landed from European origins.President Dmitry Medvedev sacked several transportations officials in the wake of the bombing. The nation's transport infrastructure will deal with extra visitors when the country hosts the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2018 World Cup. Medvedev has targeted both security officials and airport management in the wake of the bombing.Few official details have been released by the investigation and unofficial reports in the press have been contradictory; one report suggested a suicide bomber wearing a plastic explosive-based shrapnel bomb belt. Another said it could have been detonated remotely, while a third suggested a timer. Russian newspapers initially suggested a bag had exploded on the floor, while local TV has shown CCTV footage of the explosion. Unconfirmed reports also claim the Federal Security Service was searching for three people ahead of the attack and that the bomber was Vitaly Razdobudko of Stavropol.Although nobody has claimed responsibility or been arrested for the airport attack, Markin told reporters several people have been brought in on suspicion of planning an attack on December 31, while others are being sought. He linked them to an explosion on the 31st in a Moscow hotel, in which a bomber died after the device he was building went off prematurely.Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that the attack is not thought to be linked to Chechnyan insurgency. The attack is Moscow's second within a year, with two women from Dagestan, North Caucuses blowing themselves up on the Metro and killing 39 in 2010.A Russian submarine trapped during a training exercise in Berezov Bay, 75 km south of Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka, has been rescued after it was cut free by a Royal Navy Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). The crew of seven officers and midshipmen, who spent three days in temperatures around 6oC and were running out of oxygen supplies, were unharmed. The submarine appeared on the surface at 4:15 p.m. local time. "The crew opened the hatch and climbed the rescue ship's deck on their own," said Admiral Victor Fyedorov. The first aid to the crew was given on ship Alagez, and they were transferred to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatka hospital.The British Scorpio ROV cut fishing nets and debris, freeing the trapped submarine. "The rescue operation was completed successfully. We thank everyone, and especially the British rescue crew," said Fyedorov.The submarine will be repaired and modernized. "After salvaging it, AS-28 will be carried on one of the rescue ship's decks to the coast, where specialists will examine it," said a spokesperson of VMS ("Company for secondary metal and boats"). Russian President Vladimir Putin has pledged an inquiry into the incident.The United States and Japan also sent equipment to help in the rescue. However, it was not used.The Russian tour boat Bulgaria, carrying 208 people despite being certified to carry only 120, sank Sunday on Russia's Volga river.  Yesterday, prosecutors opened a wide ranging investigation into Russia's transportation industry, including an examination of the failure of governmental regulation and safety inspections of the tour boat industry.Around 80 people were saved and perhaps as many as 128 drowned, including up to fifty children caught in a playroom. Children were undocumented passengers who came aboard with their parents.  Rescuers equipped with helicopters are currently looking for survivors, and teams of 50 divers are searching the vessel and  say that people are still trapped inside. But officials hold little hope that more survivors will be found.A day of mourning was declared in Russia yesterday. Riverboats flew their flags at half-mast. Not since 1986, when two ships collided, killing 423 people, has Russia experienced a worse maritime disaster. Summer river cruises are a favorite outing in Russia, but river boats have fallen into disrepair since Soviet times. "We have far too many old ships sailing our waters," President Dmitri Medvedev said on Monday. He  vowed to bring criminal actions against the ship's operator.  Also, two commercial vessels that ignored drowning passengers and did not stop to help are expected to be charged. Yesterday, prosecutors opened an investigation into Russia's transportation industry, including an examination of the failure of governmental regulation and safety inspections of the tour boat industry.The 80m (260ft) boat  was caught in bad weather on Sunday and sank near Tatarstan while sailing from Bolgary to Kazaon, about 750km (450 miles) east of Moscow at a part of the Volga River that is very wide and considered wild. The vessel sank within a few minutes after encountering the storm. According to reports, the double-decker vessel was 56 years old and was in poor condition. One of its two engines failed before it left on its voyage on Sunday and the ship had been listing. The river boat industry lacks adequate regulation and the boats are not given complete safety inspections.The Neva Express passenger train heading to St. Petersburg from Moscow derails at 21:43 MSK (17:43 GMT) on August 13, 2007 after a bomb explosion near the railway station Malaya Vishera. At least 60 people have been injured, some taken to hospital, no one reported to be killed. The bomb made a shell-hole about 1.5 metres in diameter, officials say. 800 meters of railway track and its overhead contact system have been damaged. The bomb, determined by officials to be a homemade explosive device, was planted under the bridge.A criminal investigation has been established by Russian officials. It has been linked to an insurgency in the south of the country around Chechnya and is, according to the Federal Security Service, part of a pattern of violent attacks connected to the insurgency.The railway traffic was blocked in both directions. Services between St. Petersburg and Moscow were redirected via Volkhov.Televison star Ryan Dunn was twice over the legal drink-drive limit at the time of last Monday's car accident that killed him and a friend. The pair died when Dunn's Porsche left the road and crashed into a tree causing the car to burst into flames. Police have determined that the vehicle was travelling at speeds between 132 and 140 mph.The accident occurred in West Chester, Pennsylvania where the legal drink drive limit is a blood alcohol reading of 0.08. Toxicology results show that Dunn had a blood alcohol level of 0.196. The star had previously been caught drink-driving in 2005.Dunn made a name for himself after appearing in the television series Jackass. He starred in the TV series as well as the three follow on films that were produced. Recently he had also began to present his own television shows Homewrecker and Proving Ground.Tributes have been paid Dunn by several of his co-workers and friends. Creator of Jackass Johnny Knoxville described him as a "brother" and rock band Kings of Leon asked fans to raise a glass to Dunn during a concert on Wednesday. The band's bassist, Jared Followill, said on Twitter he was "devastated" by the death of his friend.Irish budget airline Ryanair have dismissed pilot John Goss, who has worked with the airline for 25 years, over remarks he made in a documentary about safety at the airline. Ryanair issued a statement confirming legal proceedings have been begun against Goss.The airline is already suing the UK's Channel 4 over Monday night's broadcast of Secrets of the Cockpit, part of the Dispatches series, in which Goss appeared. The programme discussed the airline's safety with a focus on fuel policy, investigating allegations Ryanair uses a bare minimum of fuel and intimidates pilots who raise concerns.Goss, who had been due to retire in October, is a key figure of Ryanair Pilots Group (RPG), which conducted a survey of more than 1,000 flight crew. According to the RPG survey almost 90% of respondents said the safety culture was nontransparent. Two-thirds said they felt uncomfortable raising safety issues. Ryanair had told pilots anybody signing a "so-called safety petition" might be dismissed. Pilots interviewed for the programme said they felt pressured to save fuel, the cost of which has hit Ryanair's profits. Following an incident in Spain in which three Ryanair flights declared fuel emergencies after being diverted to Valencia the Spanish Air Authority described Ryanair flights usually landing with a bare minimum of fuel, in a report the airline dismissed as "manifestly inaccurate and factually untrue".One anonymous pilot interviewed by Channel 4 accused the airline of "threats and bullying". Over 90% of those surveyed wanted a regulatory inquiry, with RPG saying the survey results were passed to the airline and the Irish Aviation Authority. RPG is not recognised by the airline which calls the group "[lacking] any independence, objectivity or reliability" and a union front.The other pilots interviewed by Channel 4 chose to remain anonymous, with only Goss identifying himself. The airline says RPG only conducted their survey to unionise Ryanair pilots and issued a statement describing the documentary as "based on nothing more than anonymous hearsay claims made by individuals whose identity was concealed, and/or by representatives of pilot unions of Ryanair's competitor airlines masquerading as a non-Ryanair Pilot Group".Ryanair claim Goss wrote to the airline saying he had no concerns about safety, stating "We will not allow a Ryanair employee to defame our safety on national television just three weeks after he confirmed in writing to Ryanair that he had no concerns with safety and no reason to make any confidential safety report". The airline further say they "look forward to correcting Mr Goss's defamatory claims in court".Channel 4 have previously stated an intent to defend the legal action against them.Irish budget airline Ryanair have added newspaper publishers Associated Newspapers and Mirror Group to their legal targets in a High Court defamation action filed yesterday in Dublin that also targets Channel 4.The move confirms the carrier's expression of intent to sue Channel 4 after the UK broadcaster screened Secrets of the Cockpit, a documentary about safety at the airline, on Monday night. Part of the Dispatches series, the show reported on an incident in Spain last year where three Ryanair jets declared fuel emergencies after being diverted to Valencia. Fuel policy was a strong focus for the documentary.Pilots interviewed for the programme said they felt pressured to save fuel, the cost of which has hit Ryanair's profits. The Spanish Air Authority described Ryanair flights usually landing with a bare minimum of fuel, in a report the airline dismissed as "manifestly inaccurate and factually untrue".Ryanair have also sacked veteran pilot John Goss for appearing on the show, the only pilot interviewed who did not seek anonymity. Ryanair have stated intent to sue Goss and claim he confirmed in the weeks before the show that he had no issues with his employer's safety. Goss is a member of Ryanair Pilots Group (RPG), which the airline call a union front.Channel 4 previously promised when threatened with legal action to see Ryanair in court. "We stand by our journalism, and will robustly defend proceedings if they are initiated," a spokesperson said. The Belfast Telegraph was also sued but the action has been dropped after the Northern Irish publication issued an apology. The paper had published a story titled "Are budget airlines like Ryanair putting passengers at risk?".Associated Newspapers are behind The Daily Mail and its online and Sunday variants. Mirror Group publish The Daily Mirror, its Sunday sister, and The People.Secrets of the Cockpit also examined an RPG poll of 1,000 Ryanair flight crew, dismissed by the airline as part of unionisation efforts. According to the RPG survey almost 90% of respondents said the safety culture was nontransparent. Two-thirds said they felt uncomfortable raising safety issues, with a pilot interviewed by Channel 4 accusing Ryanair of "threats and bullying". Ryanair had told pilots anybody signing a "so-called safety petition" might be dismissed. Over 90% of those surveyed wanted a regulatory inquiry, with RPG saying the survey results were passed to the airline and the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). The IAA has already called the programme a "misguided attack" on Ryanair, saying "Ryanair Plc fully complies with all European and international regulations in all areas of its operations".The IAA itself was accused of failing to respond to concerns from Ryanair pilots and one interviewee said his "personal belief is that the majority of Ryanair pilots do not have confidence in the safety agencies and that is a pretty critical issue". The authority responded "The IAA has responded to personal letters and reports from Ryanair pilots, this included several meetings and face-to-face interviews with pilots and their legal and professional representatives."Ryanair makes heavy use of zero-hour contracts, which do not guarantee work and which the Irish Airline Pilots' Association describe as offering some of aviation's worst employment conditions. RPG chairman Evert van Zwol, also a recent Dutch Airline Pilots Association president, said zero-hour contracts tended to make pilots choose to fly when unwell and keep quiet if they had safety concerns. In 2005 a Polish Ryanair pilot became lost near Rome a few days after attending his son's funeral, while his Dutch co-pilot was seeing his first experience of navigating severe weather.In the 2005 incident air traffic control intervened to keep the flight safe from midair collisions. The Polish pilot told Italian investigators he feared losing his job if he took extra time off work. The investigation concluded in 2009 he had been unfit to fly. Ryanair denied he would have been fired for taking time off to recover.Secrets of the Cockpit also reported that in twelve separate serious incidents data from cockpit voice recorders had been wiped before investigators could access it, which the carrier says is a common occcurrence in aviation and attributed to pilot error. In Sweden a report into a Ryanair emergency landing concluded this week an airline employee wiped the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder to prevent the investigation accessing them. The aircraft had returned to an airport near Stockholm shortly after takeoff suffering electrical malfunctions. Ryanair reject the Swedish Accident Investigation Authority's take on the missing data, telling newspaper Södermanlands Nyheter recordings were reset by a technician trying to repair the aircraft after consultation with Ryanair's technical department, who did not think the recordings needed saving.Ryanair, which has never suffered a fatal accident, says the documentary is "false and defamatory", and the IAA says it is "based upon false and misleading information". "We have been instructed to vigorously prosecute these libel proceedings," said a statement from Ryanair's lawyers, who promised "other litigation is pending".Irish budget airline Ryanair have stated intent to sue the UK's Channel 4 over a documentary broadcast Monday night which discussed safety at the airline. Secrets of the Cockpit focused strongly on fuel policy and featured interviews with pilots.Part of the Dispatches series, the show reported on an incident in Spain last year where three Ryanair jets declared fuel emergencies after being diverted to Valencia. Pilots interviewed for the programme said they felt pressured to save fuel, the cost of which has hit Ryanair's profits. The Spanish Air Authority described Ryanair flights usually landing with a bare minimum of fuel, in a report the airline dismissed as "manifestly inaccurate and factually untrue".Ryanair say their planes carry more fuel than European Union legislation requires and point out the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) monitor their safety record, including fuel policy. Ryanair has never had a fatal accident and the IAA called Secrets of the Cockpit a "misguided attack" which was "based upon false and misleading information".The IAA itself was accused of failing to respond to concerns from Ryanair pilots and one interviewee said his "personal belief is that the majority of Ryanair pilots do not have confidence in the safety agencies and that is a pretty critical issue". An IAA statement yesterday morning read "The IAA has responded to personal letters and reports from Ryanair pilots, this included several meetings and face-to-face interviews with pilots and their legal and professional representatives." The statement added "Ryanair Plc fully complies with all European and international regulations in all areas of its operations".Channel 4 promised to see Ryanair in court, saying "We stand by our journalism, and will robustly defend proceedings if they are initiated." Ryanair called the documentary "false and defamatory". Other claims in the documentary included that twelve cockpit voice recorders had been wiped after serious incidents, which Ryanair blamed on pilot error and said is a common occcurence in aviation, and that a survey by Ryanair Pilots Group (RPG) found widespread safety concerns at the airline.RPG is not recognised by the airline which calls the group "[lacking] any independence, objectivity or reliability". The airline says they conducted their survey, which polled 1,000 flight crew, as part of a long campaign to unionise Ryanair pilots.

The bodies of an elderly couple were found earlier today, bringing the confirmed death toll to five with three more still missing. Divers and around 45 Police officers and SES volunteers are still searching for another adult and child missing from a family of five whose car crashed down an embankment when a section of the Old Pacific Highway collapsed during the storm.While the storm has eased, it is expected to worsen again overnight. The Bureau of Meteorology, says Sydney is also expected to be affected by the storm tonight as it moves south.Duty forecaster Julie Evans said, "The low pressure system is slowly moving south so the good news is it's stopped absolutely pelting down in Newcastle and the Central Coast but now Sydney's getting the brunt of it, and it's also becoming heavier in the Illawarra."A salvage ship owned and operated by the United States firm Phoenix International has arrived in the Makassar port on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. It intends to recover the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder (collectively referred to as "black boxes") from the wreckage of Adam Air Flight 574, which crashed into the ocean nearby early on new year's day, killing all 102 on board.Adam Air spokesman Danke Drajat told reporters that the company would first survey the area, and that "If their studies show it is possible to do so, they will immediately try to retrieve the black boxes," adding, "it is our moral commitment to have the black box retrieved." He also said the survey alone would take several days.A US navy vessel, the Mary Sears, sent to the scene of the plane's disappearance had located the black boxes within weeks of the disaster, along with the rest of the wreckage, but recovery was significantly delayed because of a dispute over who would foot the bill for their recovery. With the recorders at a depth of approximately 1,700 meters (1 mile), salvage operations could cost as much as US$6 million (€4.45 million).Experts have predicted that the recovery could be further complicated by strong currents in the area, which may have buried the recorders in sediment or else dislodged them from their original location. According to one crew member, the recovery vessel - the Eas - has a 16-member crew and carries a mini submarine, which can reach depths of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet), as well as being equipped with sonar and deep sea cameras.The crash is one of three this year, which in combination have caused all Indonesian airlines to be added to the list of air carriers banned in the EU. The other two are Adam Air Flight 172 and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200.The cause of the Boeing 737s loss currently remains a mystery. It is known that while cruising at 33,000 feet (10,000 meters) the aircraft encountered a storm immediately before its disappearance, and, based on the distribution of wreckage on the seabed, it is also known that the aircraft did not experience an in-flight breakup.A suspect in a hit-and-run located in San Francisco, California, was arrested after hitting four cyclists and, two days later, lying to the police.  Over the course of six minutes, the 39-year-old man hit four people with his car and then ran off when his car crashed into another vehicle and hit a pole.  The investigators tracked down the man's address with the evidence found in the car; however, as he had moved, they were unable to find him.The suspect later told the police at Albany Police Station that his car was stolen, and after the police identified that as a lie, he was arrested. The police believes that the victims were deliberately targeted, although the motive remains a mystery. The suspect is currently in hospital for medical and psychological testing."I was only a block from my house and I saw something coming at me, from the corner of my eye. I managed to swing out of the way and avoid the full brunt of an impact," said one of the victims, Rory Madden. "It doesn't make any sense that anybody would do that, so whatever he has to say is not going to make sense." The other three men were hospitalized, two in serious condition and one in fair condition.The attack left bicycles crumpled and some cars damaged, one severely, according to San Francisco police spokeswoman, Lyn Tomkioka. "We're just really glad that he's been arrested," she said. Mayor Gavin Newsom and the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition condemned the attack, stating that there are currently efforts to make San Francisco "one of the most bike-friendly cities in the country".The morning of Saturday the 1st was a tragic one for El Salvador, as the Santa Ana Volcano, the largest and most active volcano in the country began an eruptive phase.At 8:25 a.m. Santa Ana Volcano's view from Coatepeque Lake changed as a huge flow of "hot mud" flowed from the crater towards the lake. The road that was designed as an evacuation route from that sector of the volcano was blocked completely and the inhabitants of the area had to be evacuated by helicopters.Minutes after the flow of hot mud was visible from Lake Coatepeque, a huge cloud of ash appeared, which reached an altitude of 50,000 feet, then covering the northwestern part of the country which contains the largest concentration of coffee farms (main export). The local authorities expect that this layer of ash burns the coffee plants of the affected area, decreasing the coffee production of the region considerably. Along with the ash cloud, a large amount of hot rocks (some reaching three feet in diameter) flew on all directions, damaging roads, homes and vegetation. According to the people living in the surroundings of the volcano, the rocks were released due to the huge amount of pressure released when the ash cloud appeared. Authorities report the loss of two human lives due to this incident, the cause has not yet been revealed. To prevent the loss of more lives, the government decreed a red alert in a radius of four kilometres of the crater, but yet, some people resist the evacuation proposals due to fear of losing their belongings, as they have to leave their homes without any surveillance. In response to this, the army and the police agreed to patrol the areas evacuated in order to prevent robberies.It is expected that this incident is only the beginning of a large eruptive process, which may result in a catastrophe for El Salvador.At the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) conference, a resolution was passed that encourages the Government of Saskatchewan, Canada to place a moratorium on specialty livestock farms raising wild boar. All wild boars that have escaped to roam wild should be killed, according to the resolution.Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud endorses a ban on wild boar farming. The wild boar population is expanding exponentially. There are over 2,000 feral Sus scrofa swine roaming the prairies. Two litters of approximately 12 piglets are sired by each wild boar sow every year. The Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation (SWF) likewise passed a similar resolution at their 79th annual convention to urge the Saskatchewan Government to declare the wild boar as a nuisance species which can be killed on sight.3% of farmed "wild" boars escape.  Cells of wild boars are ravenous creatures killing and eating everything in their path.  Horses, cows, and other livestock run from wild boars, breaking through fences in the process.Ostriches, emus, llamas, alpacas, reindeer, wild boar, and fallow deer were amongst the animals introduced to farms in Saskatchewan during the agricultural diversification program in the late 1970s.  Production of wild boars was promoted throughout the 1980s.According to the Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food 2001 statistics, there were 150 wild boar producers raising approximately 15,000 and 20,000 head. Of these there were about 2,700 sows. On the 2006 Census of Agriculture, 401 farms reported 4,926 boars.The boar's red meat is an export commodity to Europe and Asia. The live breeding stock are also sold to trophy hunt ranches. Full blooded wild boar and hybrid crosses are raised.In Copenhagen, Denmark on Monday, the first day in the new year, scaffolding at the corner of Randersgade and Koldinggade collapsed at about 13:00 local time (1200 UTC).  Strong winds were reported.Police cordoned off the area, noting it could collapse even more and cables for the street lightning were broken.No personal injuries were reported, but some cars were damaged, according to the Copenhagen Police.Arbejdstilsynet, the Danish workplace safety authority, was investigating the cause of the collapse and the police planned to question the company who set up the scaffolding.The second landing gear failure on a Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) de Havilland Canada Dash 8 (also known as a Bombardier Q400 following Bombardier's purchase of de Havilland Canada from Boeing) within the space of a week has prompted the grounding of many of the twin-engined turboprops.On September 9, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 1209 suffered a right landing gear failure during landing at Aalborg Airport, Denmark. A fire broke out during the crash, and five people sustained injuries. This was followed today by the similar crash of Scandinavian Airlines Flight 2748 at Palanga Airport, Lithuania. No-one was injured.The accidents have resulted in Bombardier recommending the grounding of all Q400s, which have undertaken more than 60,000 flights, as a "precautionary measure". This affects leading carriers around the world, including SAS, Alaska Air 's Horizon Air subsidiary, Flybe, Japan Airlines, Austrian Airlines Group and Augsburg Airways, and covers around 60 aircraft.SAS and Horizon Air have grounded 27 and 15 aircraft respectively, while Flybe have grounded six. Another airline, Porter Airlines, which operates the type exclusively against any others, have pointed out that their aircraft have not undertaken enough flights to be affected by the measures.The landing gear are manufactured in the United States by Goodrich Corporation. One industry analyst,  Cameron Doerksen, said that he felt that although the incidents and groundings obviously constitute bad publicity, he feels it would not influence the decision of a carrier considering whether to purchase Q400s. Bombardier declined 17 cents, or 2.7 percent, to C$6.23 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and SAS fell 6 kronor, or 4.8 percent, to 118 kronor in stock exchanging in Stockholm. Goodrich stock rose 19 cents to $64.96 on the New York Stock Exchange.The groundings have caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded every day. The cost to SAS alone is estimated at 10-15 million Swedish kronor per day.Investigators in The Netherlands have announced that last month's crash of a Boeing 737-800 was caused by a combination of an instrument failure and pilot error. Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 crashed upon approach to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, killing nine and injuring eighty of the 135 passengers and crew on board.Pieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch Safety Board, said yesterday that as the aircraft was at 1,950 feet the faulty altimeter indicated that the airliner's height was at minus eight feet. Because the autopilot and autothrottle were running from this flawed data the plane automatically reduced engine power as it would in the final seconds before landing.The plane's altitude and airspeed continued to fall for a minute and a half without the pilots noticing, when at 450 feet and an airspeed 46 mph lower than it should be the aircraft's stick shaker activated to warn the flight crew of an imminent aerodynamic stall. The pilots applied full engine thrust, but were too late to prevent the accident, and the aircraft crashed into a field and broke into three pieces."When the crew of the Turkish Airlines noticed what was going on, it was already too late to intervene effectively," commented the Board's press release. The Board also sent a warning to Boeing concerning possible problems with the 737-800's altimeters. The United States airframe manufacturer has issued an alert to operators of all variants of the 737 worldwide - totalling almost 6,000 aircraft - reminding flight crews "to carefully monitor primary flight instruments during critical phases of flight."Boeing have also stated that the preliminary report "should not be construed as a final conclusion or outcome of the investigation," and that the Board is still "in the early stages of this complex investigation." Further, they told ABC News that "erroneous radio altimeter readings are detectable and recoverable. Should a radio altimeter failure occur, anomalous readings would be detected by monitoring systems or be apparent through flight deck effects."It is apparent from the flight data recorder - which carries details of the plane's last eight flights - that the altimeter had also failed on at least two previous occasions, but the aircraft was able to land safely. Van Vollenhoven commented that misty conditions at the time of the crash would have prevented the pilots seeing their height earlier, and also said that the plane's automatic flight systems should not be used when crucial instruments are defective.A school bus, with fourteen students from the Temple High School aboard, crashed in Georgia, United States, earlier today on Georgia State Route 113 going southbound, killing one student and leaving a dozen more injured. It is reported that at the time of the crash there was a trainee driving the bus.According to the Carroll County Schools Superintendent, one student was killed and a dozen others were in need of medical care after the bus rolled over. A spokesman for the mayor and a highway patrolman also confirmed that a student died. The student has been identified as James Rashawn Walker of Temple, Georgia. It is reported that the bus was heading southbound on the highway when the driver lost control and drove into a ditch, which caused the bus to turn over. Witnesses reported the bus flipped multiple times before coming to a halt. According to a witness, Ben Cole, a lot of the students were crying and in pain. The six injured  were taken to the Tanner Medical Center and the Higgins Hospital, among them was the 45-year-old female bus driver. The Carrol County Sheriff's Department are advising concerned parents to gather at Temple High School.A woman, who was taking the road test to become a licensed school bus driver, crashed a bus into a utility pole in White Plains, New York, today. The wreck occurred on South Kensico Road between the intersections with Minevera Place and Oakley Avenue.The Journal News reported that the accident occurred at 11:30 a.m. EDT (UTC-4) and that neither the student driver nor the examiner from the New York Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) was injured.According to The Journal News the road was closed in both directions. Police and workers from the utility company, Con Edison, were on the scene inspecting the damage. The utility pole had snapped at the bottom and it was leaning on the bus.Wikinews went to the crash site and found that Con Edison crews were still working to replace the pole. Nearly five hours after the crash, a new pole had been installed and the old one was being held parallel up against it. Workers were transferring the wires onto the new pole.Kensico Road had been reopened, but only in one lane. Workers let traffic pass alternating between one direction and then the other. Ironically, the green sign that is affixed to the pole reads "DMV test site starts here."State media reported earlier today that a stampede in a school in China has killed at least eight people and injured an additional 26.The accident occurred at 21:10 local time at the Yucai Middle School, a privately-run institution in city of Xiangxiang, located in the Hunan Province. Reports say that several students were leaving their studies when one fell down a staircase, causing others to lose their balance and tumble down as well.Those hurt in the incident were treated at three hospitals in the town, and eight other students were being observed by medical personnel despite appearing not to have been hurt.Chinese officials are investigating the incident and have been questioning the city educational bureau and local school authorities, according to the Xinhua news agency.A scientist for the National Wildlife Federation, Doug Inkley, has criticised what he described as America's "addiction to oil". Inkley stated it is ultimately responsible for the Deepwater Horizon disaster earlier this year. Inkley commented on the incident, six months after the explosion which killed eleven rig workers and resulted in over 170 million gallons of crude oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico causing damage to marine wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries.Inkley is a senior scientist working for the National Wildlife Federation. He stated, "Looking back at what we knew six months after the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska illustrates the danger of too quickly drawing conclusions about the full impacts of the Gulf oil disaster." "Six months after the Exxon Valdez disaster," he continued, "the herring stocks in Prince William Sound seemed like they’d pull through. It wasn’t until the fourth year after the disaster that herring stocks collapsed due to a delayed population effect of the oil, devastating the people and wildlife that depended on them. Today, more than two decades later, this once-vital fish still hasn’t recovered."His remarks echo those issued by another environmental organisation in July. Greenpeace demanded that BP, who the United States Congress has blamed for the disaster, take a "new direction" and end an "obsession with high risk, environmentally reckless sources of oil." A spokesperson for Greenpeace said, "[t]he moment has come for BP to move beyond oil. Under Tony Hayward the company went backwards, squeezing the last drops of oil from places like the Gulf of Mexico, the tar sands of Canada and even the fragile Arctic wilderness [...] The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now." Statistics show that the United States is by far the largest consumer of oil, using 20,680,000 barrels every day. Its closest rival, China, consumes only 7,578,000 barrels per day.Inkley said incidents in the past showed there can be far-reaching effects. "The Exxon Valdez disaster was not simply one ecosystem earthquake – the aftershocks have continued to this day," he said, citing the 1989 disaster which occurred when an oil tanker ran aground in the Gulf of Alaska."What tremors are still to come in the Gulf? The aftershocks of the Gulf oil disaster will continue to cast a long shadow of uncertainty on the Gulf ecosystem and the livelihoods of those who depend upon it for years to come," pointed out Inkley. Adding, "[a]s I look back on my days in Louisiana's wetlands wading through thick black oil in prime pelican habitat, I continue to wonder: How long must we wait for lawmakers to act to prevent future disasters? How many more lives, livelihoods and animals must be claimed by our addiction to oil?"Gioacchino Giuliani, a researcher at a Gran Sasso physics institute in Italy, claims that he predicted the powerful earthquake that struck the country on Monday, but was dismissed by the authorities as a scaremonger. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) the moment magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Central Italy at 3:32 a.m. local time on April 6. So far, over 150 people have been killed with over 1,500 injured and tens of thousands of buildings damaged or destroyed. A magnitude 5.1 aftershock struck the same region just under 24 hours later.Giuliani claims to have predicted the quake by monitoring radon gas emissions.  Last month, cars with loudspeakers drove around the area, broadcasting the researcher's warning that a quake would soon strike.  He was then reported to the authorities for making false alarms, and was obliged to remove his findings from the Internet.The researcher demanded that he be given a formal apology. "There are people who must apologize to me, and they must have the weight of what occurred on their conscience," said Giuliani after the earthquake hit.Giuliani holds a patent on a device measuring atmospheric levels of radon in order to predict earthquakes. In 2005 he gave a seminar at Gran Sasso discussing the device and its use to predict tremors in the area of L'Aquila, but has not published papers on the topic. Giuliani is not a geophysicist or seismologist; rather, he is a technician working on the Large Volume Detector experiment at Gran Sasso, which measures cosmic rays.The local news agency IlCapoluogo reports that Giuliani gave an interview on March 24, in which he repeated his warning. Authorities, however, say that the earthquake was the result of a series of recent tremors in the area, and it would have been impossible to forecast its magnitude or epicenter.Giuliani lives in L'Aquila and made his findings while at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in the nearby Abruzzo region.The use of radon levels to anticipate seismic events has been under study by the seismological community since the 1970s, but a generally-accepted proven link has not been established.Both scientists and politicians are divided over the increase in hurricanes in the last 30 years. The years 1970 to 1994 saw far fewer hurricanes than 1995 to the present. The New York Times suggests this decrease was a result of generally cooler North Atlantic water driving winds that disrupted potential hurricanes from forming. Some experts say the recent intensification is part of a natural cycle, while others claim that global warming has increased both the destructive power and the frequency of hurricanes.  The Times also pointed out that during 8 recent years the U.S. has been hit by about one-third fewer severe hurricanes than usual.Britain's chief scientific adviser Sir David King stated, "We have known since 1987 the intensity of hurricanes is related to surface sea temperature and we know that, over the last 15 to 20 years, surface sea temperatures in these regions have increased by half a degree centigrade. So it is easy to conclude that the increased intensity of hurricanes is associated with global warming." Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Professor Kerry Emanuel wrote that rising sea temperatures could account for only part what he claims has been a sharp rise in the destructiveness of tropical cyclones since the 1970s.[1] Eminent hurricane expert, Professor William Gray said that Emanuel's was “a terrible paper, one of the worst I've ever looked at.” [2]Jürgen Trittin, Germany's Minister of the Environment was sharply critical of the U.S. Government. He wrote in an editorial: "Greenhouse gases have to be radically reduced worldwide. The US has, up until this point, had its eyes closed to this emergency." Carsten Voigt of the German Foreign Ministry said that while he believed that hurricanes were more powerful due to global warming, he did not believe that hurricane Katrina was the fault of America, or the Bush administration. “The main point though is that climate change is an issue that needs to be put on the table.”On Thursday, the journal Science published a report by a team from the University of Hawaii at Mānoa (UH Mānoa) and the University of Southern California (USC), saying the eruption of the Kīlauea volcano last year has been followed by a dramatic increase in the population of phytoplankton, also called green algae, in the waters surrounding the island.Study co-author and geochemist Seth John remarked in a press release, "There was no reason for us to expect that an algae bloom like this would happen [...] Lava doesn't contain any nitrate." According to the hypothesis of the report, the microbe population grew because there was suddenly a large quantity of nitrates in the water for them to feed on.  Although the lava itself was low in nitrates, it heated the deeper layers of nutrient-rich water.  This upward current brought the nitrates nearer to the surface, where phytoplankton, which also need sunlight, tend to live.UH Mānoa dispatched the research ship Ka'imikai-O-Kanaloa from July 13 to 17 of last year, when Kīlauea was still erupting, and it sailed very close to where the lava entered the ocean so researchers could study the organisms and water chemistry there.Co-lead author Sam Wilson of UH Mānoa's Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE) said, "The expedition in July 2018 provided a unique opportunity to see first-hand how a massive input of external nutrients alters marine ecosystems that are finely attuned to low-nutrient conditions [...] Ecosystem responses to such a substantial addition of nutrients are rarely observed or sampled in real time. UH has a strong tradition of not only volcanic research, but also looking at its impacts on the surrounding environment such as the ocean, groundwater, atmosphere. This latest piece of research improves our understanding of lava-seawater interactions within the much broader context of land-ocean connections."The mass of microbe-rich water, called a plume, was large enough to detect from space.  The research team used both satellite images and subsurface gliders to study the water.The study's lead authors, Wilson of C-MORE and Nick Hawco of USC, had initially hypothesized the lava itself would cause an increase in microbes that rely on iron and phosphates by directly supplying them with those nutrients.  They found there was so much iron and phosphate that the particles coalesced into clumps where these microbes could not get to them.  Other microbes, dependent on nitrates, came to dominate the plume instead.Unlike red algae, whose blooms can damage the ecosystem, green algae form the basis of the food chain, providing food for crustaceans and larger organisms.  A similar volcanic eruption in Alaska in 2008 was found to be associated with an increase in the local salmon population. Green algae also absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.The researchers have speculated this upwelling pattern may have occurred repeatedly during the volcanic process that produced the Hawaiian Island chain.Over 50 people have been confirmed dead and at least one million people have fled from their homes as a result of heavy flooding across much of southern China.In the Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces alone, at least 6,000 homes have been submerged and destroyed by the flood.Further rainfall is expected to occur throughout the next ten days.The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) has issued a warning on the situation. "Faced with the increasingly severe rain and flood situation, at 16 o’clock of June 12, Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters of Guangxi urgently started level 2 flood control emergency response and required the relevant departments and places to prepare immediately so as to ensure the work of flood control and drought relief," the CMA said in a statement released on Friday.Heavy rains in western Indonesia have triggered landslides across the region that have killed dozens of people. Meanwhile, other areas were devastated by major flooding, with water reaching two metres high in some locations.Search and rescue chief Eko Prayitno in Java told reporters that police, soldiers and volounteers were working together to attempt to reach survivors, some digging with their hands or traditional tools. Heavy equipment is available and efforts are underway to get it into place, he said, but blocked roads are making such efforts difficult.Prayitno also said that a single landslide in the Karanganyar region buried 61 people who were attending a dinner to celebrate a successful clean up of a house affected by another landslide, which had caused no injuries. "They were having dinner together when they were hit by another landslide... At least 61 people were buried." Landslides affected the region over a four hour period from 01:00 a.m. to 05:00 a.m. local time. Meanwhile, seventeen people are feared dead in the neighbouring district of Wonogiri, which has also been hit by landslides after twelve hours of nonstop torrential rain.Andi Mallarangeng, spokesperson for president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, told reporters "The president sends his deep condolence, and has ordered Home Minister [Mardiono] to inspect the scene [in Karanganyar] and monitor the emergency responses." Many fleeing residents have attempted to salvage their possessions, with some using tyres to float television sets and refrigerators to dry ground. Another single massive slide in Tawangmangu, a mountainous resort, buried 37. Metro TV News was told by an eyewitness, identified only as Karsidi, that "Those people were gathering for a tea break during communal works after the rains, and suddenly the land collapsed onto them."The affected regions spread across Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi. The population distribution in Indonesia has worsened the situation, with many people living on river flood plains to utilise the fertile soil and many more living in inaccessible mountain regions. The total death toll is estimated at up to 81 people, and eyewitnesses and local media report that thousands of homes are affected.Landslides are common in Indonesia, where large-scale rainfall is a regular occurrence. This is often exacerbated by deforestation. However, Heru, head of the local disaster coordinator agency in Karang Anyar, commented that "The forest in the area is thick," and consequently he did not believe deforestation was a causal factor. The region he is responsible for has recorded 36 deaths and 30 more buried in thick mud near the banks of the Bengawan Solo river. Meanwhile Julianto, another provincial government official, said "The landslides took us by surprise. This is the first time in the last 25 years anything of this scale occurred here in Central Java."Julianto also commented that thousands of people displaced from their homes by flooding and landslides have been forced into temporary accommodation in buildings and tents provided by emergency response teams.Today's disasters coincide with the third anniversary of the Asian tsunami, which killed an estimated 230,000 people. A tsunami drill on Java was unaffected as the seasonal poor weather did not have an adverse affect on the area of the drill.At least 58 people are now dead as a result of the recent flooding in Yemen, and at least 20,000 in the country have no access to shelter. Five people are also reported missing.The Yemeni government has pledged to send tents to help the homeless.The flooding is caused by the recent heavy rain in Yemen, which came as a shock due to the fact that the country only receives several centimeters of rain per year.In addition to the 58, four people were also killed by lightning, which struck Yemen during the large storms. The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) released a statement regarding the floods. "The Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Professor Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, extended his sincere sympathy to the government and people of Yemen following the devastating floods caused by torrential rains, causing a grave humanitarian crisis in the governorates of Hadramaut and Mahra," it stated."Ihsanoglu pointed up the heavy death toll and the massive destruction that hit the infrastructure, such as roads, power and water distribution networks, describing the situation as a national disaster. He urged the international community to provide aid and assistance to the victims."At least 79 people, nearly all of them women, were trampled to death and 290 more injured Saturday morning in a stampede outside the Ultra Stadium in Pasig City in Metro Manila.  The crowd, estimated at 30,000, had been lined up to get tickets to the Wowowee game show, popular for its prizes.  According to reports, the stampede was triggered when someone shouted a bomb threat.A man who visited Costa Rica who was on American Airlines flight 1552 from Miami, Florida to Toronto was stung by a scorpion on Sunday. The scorpion was from Costa Rica, where the man was on a camping trip with his brother.The scorpion crawled out of the man's carry-on knapsack. Then, the scorpion stung the man, who is believed to be in his 20s or early 30s. Flight officials immediately delayed the outbound flight. The man was treated by paramedics and was taken to hospital.Later, the scorpion was killed. Animal control officers said the scorpion was a non-lethal species."We delayed the outbound flight and searched the cabin of the aircraft to see if we could find any more, which we did not," said John Hotard, a company spokesman in Fort Worth, Texas. "This is rare. I'm not aware of a scorpion stinging a person on any of our flights before.""We've had cases where passengers have brought critters on board in their backpack and they get out and crawl around, but it's rare," he added.They arrived safely at Toronto's Pearson International Airport. The flight back to Miami was delayed by less than an hour.When the flight resumed, the pilot said: "Welcome to Scorpion Flight 1011."The scorpion is said to have been brought on the plane unintentionally.Scotland has refused bail to the Libyan man convicted of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 despite his terminal cancer, as he can receive treatment in prison. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi was jailed in 2001 for the 1988 bombing of the transatlantic airliner, killing 270 people, but is seeking to have his conviction overturned.Minutes after Edinburgh's Appeals Court rejected bail on compassionate grounds Jim Swire, spokesman for the victim's families who lost his daughter in the disaster, complained about the ruling. "It has never been a goal of our group to seek revenge," said a lawyer outside the court reading from his statement. "The refusal of a return to his family for a dying man whose verdict is not even yet secure looks uncomfortably like either an aspect of revenge -- or perhaps timidity."Al-Megrahi, a former intelligence officer, is 54 and serving a minimum of 27 years for the bombing. He has advanced prostate cancer which is spreading through his body. His request for bail was rejected by Lord Hamilton, Scotland's head judge, who said that as doctors say he could live a few more years he should not be released unless and until after his appeal succeeds or his condition worsens.Some other doctors give his time as just months, as the cancer has reached his bones. Hamilton however said that palliative hormone treatment could prolong his life. Hamilton also said Al-Megrahi was not suffering "material pain or disability".The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ruled last year that the conviction may be a miscarriage of justice. It said there was significant doubts to be raised over several key pieces of evidence in the original trial.British investigators from Scotland Yard have concluded that former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed as the result of a suicide bomb blast and not an assassin's bullet. The results of the investigation were handed over to Pakistani government officials in Islamabad. The findings by Scotland Yard support the Pakistani government's version of how Ms. Bhutto was assassinated after leaving a political rally last December in Rawalpindi. Immediately before she was attacked, Ms. Bhutto was waving to supporters from the roof of her armoured car.The Scotland Yard detectives concluded that Ms. Bhutto died when the force of a suicide bomb blast rammed her head into the roof of the car.  The head of Pakistan's team investigating the assassination, Abdul Majeed, read the findings of the British pathologist who assisted with the investigation."The blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle causing a severe and fatal head injury," Majeed said.Television footage of the attack shows a single gunman firing shots toward Ms. Bhutto seconds before the explosion. Investigators determined the person firing the gun was also the suicide bomber."All the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shot before detonating an improvised explosive device," Majeed said. "At the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of Mrs. Bhutto's vehicle."Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf invited Scotland Yard to investigate the cause of Ms. Bhutto's death after some of her supporters charged that the government could be involved in the attack and was covering up circumstances of her assassination.Officials of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party maintain she was shot during the attack.  Even after the results of the Scotland Yard investigation were released, party spokeswoman Sherry Rehman insists that an assassin's bullet hit the former prime minister."We clearly saw even on footage that she recoiled from a bullet and she fell inside," Rehman said. "The issue really is that this gives us all the more reason to ask for a larger U.N. investigation into what led up to the events of December 27 and to what is behind the hand that pulled the trigger and to who are the financiers, sponsors, organizers and perpetrators of this crime."The Scotland Yard report notes that despite the lack of a detailed search of the crime scene or an autopsy of Ms. Bhutto's body, sufficient evidence is available for investigators to draw what they are calling reliable conclusions.Detectives relied on X-rays of Ms. Bhutto's head and a detailed examination of video footage of the attack.  The British team only investigated how Ms. Bhutto was killed, not who was behind it.The Pakistani government says an al-Qaida-linked militant chief based on the border with Afghanistan is responsible for her killing.At least four people have been arrested in connection with the case, including a 15-year-old boy who told police he was among a five-man suicide squad charged with assassinating the opposition leader.Ms. Bhutto's death led to widespread rioting and protests and forced a delay of nationwide elections currently scheduled for later this month.Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland has seen a fire, which has since been extinguished. The facility was operating at 80% of its 200,000 barrel per day capacity after operations were shut down for a two-day strike last month. A spokesman for Ineos, who operate the site, said that it was expected that the fire would delay the restoration of full operations at the plant. According to a spokesman from the Central Scotland Fire and Rescue Service said it is believed that the fire began after oil spilt from the hydrocracker onto hot pipework. The hydrocracker is used to break down thicker hydrocarbons into lighter variants, and in this way produces products such as diesel and aviation fuel. The fire was on the diesel line.The plant, which is located on the Firth of Forth, was previously expected to be running at full capacity by May 18. The fire, which the Ineos spokesman described as a "very small incident", started at 2:10am and was extinguished by 5:00am.Ineos, who purchased the site from BP in 2005, are investigating.A minibus overturned on the A6089 road between Gordon and Carfraemill in the Scottish Borders on Saturday night. The rural accident killed one man and injured 23 more.The bus was reportedly carrying an all-male group from Newtongrange to Kelso. Following the accident, local authorities declared a major incident, with Police Scotland, the Scottish Ambulance Service, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, NHS Scotland, and Scottish Borders Council all collaborating on the response.Per the reports, an air ambulance ferried one survivor to Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; fourteen casualties were taken to Borders General Hospital in Melrose; and eight were taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. The minibus held 23 passengers plus a driver. Authorities closed the road after the crash at around 10:50am, reopening it at 9:00pm.59-year-old East Lothian man Ross Jones Barker has been identified as the man killed at the accident location.  Barker and some other passengers were traveling to Kelso to attend the Kelso Races, a local horse race. Images of the bus showed it upended in a field perpendicular to the road, with extensive crush damage to the roof. BBC reported the minibus left tyre marks on the road.Traffic Scotland took to Twitter on the day of the accident to warn of strong wind gusts affecting driving in the area. The road has a poor safety reputation among locals, who know it for its multiple blind summits. Police Scotland's Road Policing Unit carried out on-site investigations and was working to establish the circumstances. The vehicle has since been righted  and recovered.Reverend Malcolm Muir of Newtongrange described "a solemnity across the village at the moment" in the "tight-knit community" which "has a very strong sense of identity."The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC), an organisation that investigates alleged miscarriages of justice, is to complete a review on June 28, 2007 of the conviction on January 31, 2001 of Libyan Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi for the December 21, 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. All 259 passengers and crew of the Boeing 747, and eleven people on the ground, were killed when a bomb destroyed the aircraft over the town of Lockerbie in Scotland. Megrahi was convicted on 270 counts of murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. It is expected that the SCCRC will refer Megrahi's case back to the court of appeal. A summary of the Commission's findings will be published, but the main report will not.Today's Scotsman reported that documents leaked from Megrahi's legal team include allegations that evidence used to convict him 'was subject to deliberate destruction and manipulation for political reasons'. Officials in both the United States and the United Kingdom are accused of "a co-ordinated effort to mislead the court" in order to divert attention from other suspects with links to Iran or Syria, whose support was needed at the time of the first Gulf War.During its three-year review, the SCCRC has been shown hundreds of documents and photographs which are alleged to show that evidence was invented, manipulated or ignored by the British police on the one hand and the CIA and FBI on the other. Veteran politician Tam Dalyell, who has campaigned against the conviction for years, has now said that the full report by the SCCRC should be made public, adding "The Crown Office has a moral obligation to hold a public inquiry. If it embarrasses the Scottish judiciary, so be it. We're in danger of becoming the laughing stock of Europe." He also said “I have no doubt that evidence was planted, and I have said so repeatedly in the Commons. Only a full, public and nonadversarial inquiry can finally settle this matter.” Meanwhile, defence lawyers said that if Megrahi is granted an appeal or retrial they will attempt to convince authorities to release him until the case comes to court.The credibility of several key parts of the prosecution's case is seriously questioned in the evidence submitted to the SCCRC, with rescue workers describing items as intact when they were discovered, but which were presented in fragmentary form at the Lockerbie bombing trial. The evidence of Maltese shopkeeper Tony Gauci is also challenged. Although Gauci testified that Megrahi bought clothes from him that were later found to have been in the suitcase containing the bomb, in reality he apparently gave a number of inconsistent and substantially different accounts of who bought the clothes, failed to pick out Megrahi at an identity parade, and even linked the clothes' purchase to convicted Egyptian terrorist Mohammed Abu Talb, from the Iran-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Defence lawyers also alleged that two early statements by Gauci are missing altogether.One investigator also claims that evidence was fabricated, while there was insufficient investigation into claims by a baggage handler at Heathrow International Airport that the suitcase containing the bomb was only added to the flight at the last minute.The SCCRC refused to comment, saying: "It is not for Scottish ministers to comment or preempt the outcome of this review." Further it said: "It is the strong view of the Scottish Government that due process of law will be followed and seen to be followed in all matters pertaining to this case." The SCCRC will issue it's report on Thursday June 28, 2007.A resident of Scotland, United Kingdom has been released from death row in Ohio, United States after serving 21 years imprisonment awaiting execution after being convicted of an arson attack in which a two-year-old girl died. Kenny Richey, who has dual US-UK citizenship, was expected to return to Scotland within a week.Richey was expected to be released today, however, he was rushed to the hospital with chest pains. The hearing to release him has been rescheduled for January 8, 2008, spoiling Richey's plans to be back in Scotland for Christmas. He has suffered at least three heart attacks in the last three years.The 43-year-old man had moved to Ohio to join his American father at 18. A week before he was due to return to Scotland, in 1986, a fire broke out which killed two-year-old Cynthia Collins. He was convicted of starting the fire, which was alleged to be aimed at a former girlfriend of his, who resided in the flat above.His original conviction was overturned in August by the Cincinnati court of appeal, which ruled his defence team had mishandled the case. This resulted in his temporary transfer to a low-security prison.It has now emerged that he has arranged a plea bargain that will ensure his release, in which he will plead no contest to charges of attempted involuntary manslaughter, child endangering and breaking and entering. His sentence for these offenses will be time already served."Kenny didn't commit the crime he was charged of, and thank goodness now the American prosecutor recognises it," human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, a representative of Richey, told BBC Radio 4. "On Saturday, he will get to be home with his mother for the first time in 21 years. That's wonderful news. This poor child died in a fire that was an accident, and this man has spent 21 years and 173 days in prison, facing the death penalty, for a crime he didn't commit. If there's any better example of why the death penalty is wrong, I don't know what it is."Ken Parsigan, solicitor for Richey, told reporters that the agreement was "as close to the state admitting it was wrong as we are going to get".An employee in the office of Putnam County Prosecutor Gary Lammers said he would be unavailable for comment until after Thursday's hearing, which has now been rescheduled for January 8 by visiting Judge Alan Travis.Richey was almost executed thirteen years ago; on that occasion, he came within an hour of being killed.Two cars have been involved in a road traffic accident in the Scottish Lothian and Borders region, causing three fatalities and sending three to hospital. The incident occurred on the A68 road approximately 1.5 miles south of the Midlothian village of Pathhead when a Škoda Octavia and a Nissan Note travelling in opposite directions collided at approximately 0730 UTC today.The Nissan, which was carrying five occupants, overturned and came to rest on its roof. Three male Buddhist monks who sat in the back of the car died at the site of the crash. The female driver of the vehicle managed to get out of the vehicle herself but another male passenger in the front of the car had to be cut free by fire service members. The two front-seat passengers as well as the male driver of the Škoda were hospitalised at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, although none of their injuries are considered likely to be fatal."This is a tragic incident," Inspector Simon Bradshaw of Lothian and Borders Police said, "and we are currently in the process of carrying out inquiries in order to establish the full circumstances of the collision." The A68 road close to the location of the accident was temporarily closed to allow police to investigate the incident, with traffic redirected to the B6370 road via the town of Gorebridge. The road has since reopened.Crown Office are staying quiet about possible prosecutions after an inquiry found medical failures caused three deaths at NHS Lanarkshire. In response to a specific question as to the possibility of prosecutions, a Crown Office spokesperson told Wikinews today that "The three deaths were fully investigated by the Procurator Fiscal and reported to Crown Counsel [laywers] to consider. Crown Counsel concluded that, given the facts and circumstances of the deaths, a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) was the appropriate forum to consider the circumstances of the deaths." It was further noted that "[a] FAI cannot make any findings of fault/blame against individuals."However, Crown Office did not specifically rule out prosecutions for offences such as cuplable homicide despite the spokesperson noting this was a direct response to such a question. They also declined to comment on National Health Service care as "it would not be appropriate to comment on the provision of NHS services" and entirely ignored questions about Crown Office satisfaction in the inquiry's outcome and the length of time it took to reach a conclusion. The inquiry wrapped up last week but the deaths were in 2006.Agnes Nicol, George Johnstone, and Andrew Ritchie died within a three-month period following keyhole surgery to remove their gall bladders.Later expanded to look at all three deaths, the inquiry initially established to look into the case of Nicol, 50, who received surgery in late 2005. A surgeon at Wishaw General Hospital mistakenly cut her bile duct and her right hepatic artery. Whilst suturing her portal vein, her liver was left with 20% of its normal blood supply; the errors were not discovered until her transfer to liver specialists at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary.By then, her liver was seriously damaged. She developed septicaemia, dying from multiple organ failure in March 2006.Johnstone, 54, underwent the same procedure at Monklands District General Hospital on May 9, 2006. A consultant surgeon accidentally damaged, possibly severing, his bile duct. He died two days later in intensive care from the combined effects of multiple organ failure and a heart ailment.Ritchie, 62, died in intensive care a week after an operation in June 2006. He died from intra abdominal haemorrhage caused by errors during the surgery.Different surgeons were involved each time and the inquiry, under Sheriff Robert Dickson, found no evidence of poor training or inadequate experience. Dickson noted that in each case there was lack of action on a "growing body of evidence that there was something fundamentally wrong with the patient" and surgeons failed to contemplate their own actions as potentially responsible. He agreed with two professors that it may have been possible to save their lives "had the post-operative care been to the standard which they expected, and had there been a proper management plan which staff could have worked to" and noted that all the patients suffered from a lack of adequate medical notes being available after their surgery. He described the care as having "clear faults".NHS Lanarkshire apologised and said improvements had been made regarding "these types of cases" as well as with document management. Wikinews got in touch seeking details of the changes made but the health trust failed to respond.The San Diego State University (SDSU) and Brigham Young University (BYU) football game, originally scheduled for October 27, 2007 in San Diego, has been postponed until December 1. Qualcomm Stadium, home of the SDSU Aztecs, is currently housing 12,000 evacuees from the Southern California wildfires.In addition to the housing of evacuees at the stadium, the decision to postpone the game was made for several other reasons. Federal and state declarations of a state of emergency; air quality; transportation considerations; closure of SDSU; student-athlete well-being; fan safety; and competitive equity, all played a role. Mountain West Conference commissioner Craig Thompson said, "There is a far greater priority than sporting events in the San Diego area at this time. The focus should be on emergency response and resources, and getting the community back on its feet. Our thoughts are with our colleagues at San Diego State University, as well as everyone who has been affected by this disaster."The Principality of Sealand is currently being checked, after a fire caused havoc to the ex-World War II tower. Fire fighters from the Thames Coastguard poured water onto the structure, and rescued a security guard who was taken to Ipswich hospital by an RAF helicopter, suffering from smoke inhalation. It is believed that the fire was started by a fault in a generator. The Harwich off-shore lifeboat team attended the platform, and described the top platform as having caught alight due to an 'electrical fire'.Sealand, formerly HM Fort Roughs, is a self declared principality comprising of an old army fort. It was built to deter, and report back on, any German attempts to lay mines using aircraft in the channel of the Thames. The offshore company HavenCo used it to hold servers for the computer industry.For the past week, approximately 100 sealing ships have been trapped in ice floes off the northeast coast of Newfoundland. The ships and their crew had been participating in the annual seal hunt off Canada's easternmost province.Several of the vessels have been damaged by the ice and supplies are now running low for those sailors awaiting rescue by the Canadian Coast Guard. As of Thursday, 6:00 p.m. EDST, some 20 crew members, out of an estimated 400, had been rescued.A Coast Guard icebreaker, the Sir Wilfred Grenfell, on mission to free the trapped ships, itself became stuck in the ice. A Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) spokesperson indicated to CTV News that, although the Grenfell had since been freed, another icebreaker, the Ann Harvey, was now trapped. "It's just such heavy ice that even ice breakers are having trouble," said Erika Pittman, a communications officer with the DFO. In addition to the crushing ice, extreme weather conditions have been hampering rescue efforts. Pittman suggested that conditions wouldn't improve until sometime next week. The amount and thickness of the pack ice, according to Pittman, is the worst it has been for sealers in the past 15 years.In addition to three icebreakers on hand, the Coast Guard is flying helicopters in to provide food and support to the stranded sailors. Most of the sealing ship captains have refused to abandon their ships, instead staying with them and hoping for a change in conditions or to be freed by the Coast Guard."Usually you try to stay with the ship because you think the safety is with the ship because the ship is big, but sometimes it is too late. In this case, we're hoping that as it changes and the breakers and helicopters are there and we can get them all out," said Brian Penney, a superintendent with the Coast Guard."They're putting a lot of effort into pulling them out," said Penny. "But the sheer numbers, it's a very, very slow process." According to Penny, approximately 15 of the longliners ships have had their hulls damaged by the ice to the extent that the ships are at risk of sinking.Critics of the seal hunt point out that the annual hunt is not only "cruel to animals", but is also a dangerous occupation for the sealers. When sealers have to be rescued by the Coast Guard, "Canadian taxpayers foot the bill," suggested Rebecca Aldworth, director of Canadian wildlife issues for the Humane Society of the United States.Monsoon rains in Cambodia hampered the search today for the crash site of a PMTair Antonov An-24, which went down yesterday with 22 people aboard."You can't see each other more than 40 metres away," Keo Sivorn, safety chief of the Civil Aviation Secretariat, was quoted by Reuters as saying. "The search teams are facing lots of obstacles. Until this morning, the rain continued to pour and the hills are very slippery as well as densely forested," Keo Sivorn continued.Thick clouds made visibility poor for the helicopter-borne rescue crews looking for the site. The search is centered in the Dâmrei Mountains of Kampot Province, about 150 kilometers south of the capital, Phnom Penh.Radar contact with the Russian-made Antonov An-24 was lost at around 10:40 a.m. local time (0340 GMT) yesterday. The flight had departed at around 10 a.m. from Angkor International Airport in Siem Reap, near the popular Angkor Wat temple complex, and was heading to Sihanoukville International Airport at Sihanoukville, a beach resort town on the Gulf of Thailand. The plane was about 50 kilometers from its destination when it was lost.Around 1,000 people are combing the heavily forested mountains, Ly Thuch, deputy director of the National Disaster Committee, told Agence France Presse. "We hope to find them soon. The [rescuers] will search deeper into the forest," Ly Thuch was quoted as saying.Rescue efforts have been further hindered by uncertainty of the exact location of the crash, with some reports saying the plane had actually gone down in the Sihanoukville municipality, west of Kampot. So far, rescuers have had only vague eyewitness accounts from local villagers, Ly Thuch said.Prime Minister Hun Sen offered US$5,000 to the person who finds the plane."Our hope of finding survivors is slim," he said, according to Reuters. "I am appealing to all, including farmers, who can help us locate the plane, and offering a reward of $5,000 in hard cash."The flight had 16 passengers – 13 South Koreans and three Czechs, plus a flight crew of a Russian pilot and five Cambodians. The South Korean embassy in Cambodia said all 13 of its citizens were tourists.PMTair is a small Cambodian airline with domestic and international routes, including direct flights from Seoul to Siem Reap, feeding a large influx of tourists from South Korea in the past few years. Last year, around 250,000 South Koreans visited the country. The airline had begun regularly scheduled Siem Reap-Sihanoukville flights in January, providing a direct link between the two popular tourist towns.The airline has a checkered safety reputation. In 2005, a piece of landing gear snapped off an aging Antonov AN-24 on landing at Banlung, Ratanakiri, overcrowded with 59 passengers aboard. There were no injuries, but the airline was temporarily grounded after the incident. In another incident, a plane had to return to the airport after takeoff because of engine failure.Yesterday's crash is Cambodia's first major aviation accident in nearly ten years. In September 1997, a Vietnam Airlines Tupolev Tu-134 crashed while trying to land in heavy rain at Phnom Penh International Airport, killing 65 of 66 people aboard. The sole survivor was a toddler.Three days after a US Navy helicopter collided with a US Coast Guard airplane off the coast of California, a search and rescue mission is ongoing for the nine crew onboard the two aircraft.The two on board the AH-1W SuperCobra attack helicopter and seven on the C-130 Hercules transport plane were trained in survival and described as being in good physical condition, meaning rescuers maintain hope of finding them alive. They all had heat-retaining drysuits but it was unknown if they were wearing them at the time.The accident occurred at 7:10 p.m. on Thursday in an area of military airspace that is sometimes closed to the public, although its status at the time of the accident was not known. The helicopter had been in formation with two transports and another SuperCobra to practise night flying, while the Coast Guard plane was conducting search and rescue for 50-year-old boater David Jines. The search for Jines ends today whether he is found or not.Rear Admiral Joseph Castillo said today that the missing air crews  are "trained in survival tactics, they're trained also with the will to live. We know they have the ability to survive longer than you might expect." However, he also expressed concern that there may not be any survivors. "... hope gets less every day. My hope today is not what it was yesterday."After searching 644 square miles of ocean with nine aircraft debris has been located from both the aircraft, but no trace has been found of those on board. Operations are currently focusing near the military's San Clemente Island, where an area of about 50 miles of floating wreckage is located.Rescuers are still searching for the bodies of three children, presumed dead, after an eruption by an Indonesian volcano on Saturday.Located on the Palu'e Island, Mount Rokatenda threw rock and ash into the sky causing local destruction. Lava spilled onto the beach, killing three adults and three children in their sleep. Rescuers have recovered the bodies of the adults but the children’s remains have still not been found.In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Tini Thadeus, head of the local disaster agency, says he is pessimistic about recovering the bodies. Due to the remains being buried under hot material, Thadeus believes they will be difficult to reach.Indonesian rescuer Bakri Kari raises more doubt about the recovery as he describes the scene, saying that it was "tough" walking in the area as the ground is "covered in ash 10 to 20 centimeters thick." Despite this, the search for the bodies continues.When the volcano became active, 2,000 people evacuated the island, while 8,000 remained.According to a statement by a police officer sent to Raoul Island in order to find the body of Mark Kearny, 33, who worked on researches on volcanoes on Raoul Island, Kearny was checking the temperature of the crater lake on March 17 when it erupted, blowing trees over, throwing boulders into the air, and burying the surrounding area in mud up to 5m deep.A team of specialists has been sent to the island, but it is likely that the immense heat has destroyed the body of Mr Kearny.Search and rescue operations for a light aircraft that disappeared seven days ago in Brazil have ceased having failed to locate the plane. In addition to two local pilots the Cessna 310 was carrying four businessmen who were citizens of the United Kingdom.Rescue teams utilising two air force helicopters and a fixed-wing aircraft, as well as several naval vessels, scoured an area of 3,475 square miles off the North-East of the country for the missing plane, which was chartered from Aero Star. Although the plane and its occupants remain missing, some floating personal possessions from those on board and several pieces of wreckage have been recovered.The pilot and co-pilot have been identified as Clovis de Figueiredo e Silva and Leandro Oliveira Veloso respectively, and the passengers as Alan Kempson, Sean Woodhall, Ricky Every and Nigel Hodges. The businessmen were flying in connection to a propsed luxury housing development at the Bahia town of Ilheus, whose airport the plane had been a few kilometres away from and intending to land.The four Britons, three of whom reside abroad, had initially attempted to hire a helicopter for the journey but were denied this due to weather conditions that were deemed to poor for rotorcraft operation. Their relatives have hired a boat with sonar equipment and intend to search deeper waters for the lost plane.The search has today continued for adventurer Steve Fosset, 63, who went missing recently after his plane went missing in the US. He was last seen in his single engined plane at an airfield in Nevada. His plane is thought to have come down in densely wooded land to the south of the airfield.The tracking beacon signals in the rescue kit of the plane have not been located however the rescue effort has been continuing by the use of many planes and thermal imaging cameras.Close friend Sir Richard Branson has not yet given up hope, however rescuers have been describing the task as "like finding a needle in a haystack".Steve is well known for his record attempts including becoming the first person to fly round the world in a hot air balloon.The search for the 16 missing people has been called off about 34 hours after the Sikorsky S92 helicopter crashed in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday.  The helicopter is lying on its side at a depth of 178 metres approximately 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the Newfoundland shoreline, about 55 miles (89 km) southeast of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.Of the original 18 people on board, Robert Decker is in critical condition in hospital and the body of Allison Maher had been recovered. Decker is the only survivor of the crash.  The remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) used to search the wreckage, have videotaped ten to thirteen of the missing within the helicopter. At first recovery crews were hoping to haul the main body of the helicopter and its fuselage up intact, but because of the helicopter's condition, the Transportation Safety Board will first retrieve the bodies from within the tangled metal.Weather permitting, the recovery of the helicopter should be completed by the end of today.Aircraft and water vessels from the French, American, and Brazilian military were searching the Atlantic on Monday after an Air France passenger jet with 228 people on board disappeared over the ocean. Search teams from Brazil mainly focused on the area north of Fernando de Noronha, an island located approximately two hundred miles off the coast of Brazil. France's military, meanwhile, was several hundred miles away, searching the waters near Cape Verde.Airplanes from Senegal and Spain have also been sent out to help out in the search effort. French officials have also asked for United States satellite data to help with the search."We want to try to reach the last point where the aircraft made contact, which is about 1,200km [745 miles] north-east of Natal [located in Brazil]," said Colonel Jorge Amaral, a spokesman for the Brazil air force.French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he was pessimistic that any survivors would be found."This is a catastrophe the likes of which Air France has never seen before. I said the truth to them: the prospects of finding survivors are very low," the president said to reporters at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France. The Pentagon has also ordered aircraft to assist in finding the plane. The Airbus A330 had departed from Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night, with a dozen crew members and 216 passengers on board, according to a spokeswoman for Air France. The jet was in a normal cruise at 840 kilometres per hour at about 10,700 metres above sea level when it disappeared, almost four hours after having departed. No problems were apparent when the aircraft made its last radar contact.Air France said that the aeroplane "crossed through a thunderous zone with strong turbulence" at about 23.00 local time (02.14 GMT). Approximately fourteen minutes later, an automated message was sent saying that the cabin had lost its pressurisation and that the electrical system of the aircraft had failed.If no survivors are found, then this would be the worst aviation disaster since the November 2001 American Airlines Flight 587 crash.A search and rescue operation is underway off the coast of Guam after a B-52 Stratofortress belonging to the United States Air Force (USAF) crashed with six crewmembers on board. At least two people have been pulled from the water but their conditions have not been made available. The area in question has also yielded a field of floating debris and oil. According to Lt. Elizabeth Buendia, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Coast Guard in Guam, the search is likely to continue throughout the night.Since the bomber's crash at 9:45 a.m. local time, both local and military teams have mobilised six vessels, three helicopters, two F-15 fighter jets and another B-52. 70 square miles of sea have been searched, starting roughly 30 miles northwest of Guam's Apra Harbour.The aircraft was posted to Guam's Andersen Air Force Base as part of a four-month rotation scheme and was based in Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. It is believed that the bomber was scheduled to be used in a flyover of Liberation Day crowds celebrating the 1944 capture of Guam from Japan by the US, with the island remaining a US territory. However, some confusion exists over whether it was in fact another aircraft that was scheduled for the flyover.The B-52 is a 160-foot (50-metre) long-range heavy bomber manufactured by Boeing suitable for mid-air refuelling. The first having entered service in 1955, it is one of the oldest types still operated by USAF, who have used the aircraft for both attacks and surveillance.This is the second aircraft that the USAF has lost at Guam this year. In February a B-2 stealth bomber crashed on takeoff at Andersen Air Force Base, with the loss costing an estimated US$1.4 billion. Both pilots escaped by ejecting, and the accident was determined to have been caused by moisture on a sensor.The cause of today's accident is unknown. The USAF will assemble a board of officers to investigate.Searchers looking for New Zealand fishing boat FV Jubilee found the vessel on the sea floor overnight local time (UTC+13).The search was sparked by a mayday call from the three-man crew early yesterday morning. The three fishermen said they were abandoning ship in favour of a lifeboat. The search, which covered roughly 170 square km, earlier located an empty lifeboat from FV Jubilee.A police dive team was sent today to look for bodies. Police and owner-operator Ocean Fisheries believe the missing men are deceased. Weather conditions at the site, around 40 m deep and 22 km from the Rakaia River mouth, are reported with dropping wind and swells of 1.5 m."The sea conditions were rough," said Ocean Fisheries boss Andrew Stark; "without knowing what was going wrong with the vessel we really can't speculate, whether the sea was a cause or a contributing factor. Rough conditions are usual at sea, so we don't believe the weather was severe enough to be the main contributing factor. There must have been something involved prior to that which caused the vessel to sink."Stark said the accident is "a mystery". He said the company had trawled the area with other ships in the hope of retrieving corpses from the sea bed. In addition to Ocean Fisheries boats FV Legacy and FV Frontier, which used technology designed for locating fish to search for the wreck, search vehicles included a helicopter, a plane, and two Coastguard vessels. An emergency beacon, oil, fishing bins, and documentation are among the floating debris found.Launched in January 2008, FV Jubilee is 16 m long and weighs 100 t.Sixteen were wounded, one seriously when a Palestinian rammed a backhoe loader into a bus followed by attacks on several other vehicles Tuesday afternoon in Jerusalem before he was shot dead by the security forces. This is the second such incident in Jerusalem in three weeks. A spokesman for the Israeli police said that a civilian shot the vehicle's driver but the bulldozer was still running. A police patrol continued shooting until the driver died.The bulldozer driver who was, according to witnesses, wearing a large white skullcap common to religious Muslims, first hit the No. 13 bus on its side and then chased it while raising the shovel of his front-end loader, the driver managed to make a right turn and get away from the bulldozer which then went on to zig zag across the street and hit further cars until it came to a stop following the driver being gunned down.Speaking in Amman, United States presidential candidate Barack Obama said: "Today’s bulldozer attack is a reminder of what Israelis have courageously lived with on a daily basis for far too long. I strongly condemn this attack and will always support Israel in confronting terrorism and pursuing lasting peace and security."After the attack, which follows a similar attack on July 2, and the indictment of six Israeli-Arabs from Jerusalem accused of belonging to a terrorist cell, Jerusalem Mayor Uri Lupolianski, said: "We should reconsider the employment of these people."A second powerful earthquake of magnitude 6.3 has struck the island of New Britain in the Pacific Ocean region around Papua New Guinea, just 11 days after a damaging 7.0 quake left the western side of the island without power and communications for almost three days.The epicenter of the quake, reported by the USGS to have struck at a depth of 197.2km (119.2 miles), was just 149 km (93 miles) from the main town on New Britain, Kandrian.It hit at 1.10AM local time, Monday 16 August (15:09 UTC, Sunday 15 August).There are no initial reports at time of press of casualties or damage, and no word at this time from the PTWC of any impending threat of a tsunami.A fire in an office building in Karachi, Pakistan has killed one and injured four. Reports say that the fire was the second at the building, locating near the town's shipping terminal, in half a year.The building, which is owned by the state-owned Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC), had suffered a previous fire in February. The first fire, caused by a short circuit, damaged five floors, burning from floors 12 to 16. The building is 17 stories high.Today's fire destroyed seven more floors, starting on the 4th around 2:30 p.m. and being propelled up to the 10th by strong winds in the area. The deceased was a male shipping company official, who was assisting efforts to extinguish the blaze. According to the International Herald Tribune, he lost consciousness after inhaling smoke and fumes, and was pronounced dead on arrival after being rushed to hospital. However, The Hindu News reports that officials said he died near the scene from a heart attack, brought on by the ensuing disaster. The Hindu News also gives his name and occupation as Vijay Kumar, an administrator and manager employed by the PNSC.Four firefighters received injuries from falling glass shards and other assorted debris. One technician was trapped on the roof where he had been performing maintenance on a communications tower installed there. He was rescued by one of two navy helicopters dispatched to the scene. In addition to the helicopters, 115 firefighters and 25 fire engines from the city fire brigade and the Karachi Port Trust attended, as well as a number of ambulances from relief organizations.It is reported by some that the likely cause of the fire was another electrical short circuit, similar to the one that triggered February's fire. However, Pakistan's Minister for Shipping and Ports Babar Ghouri said that subversive or terrorist activity could not be ruled out and it was strange that the last time a blaze broke out in the building was also a Sunday. "We are going to carry out a full-scale investigation into this fire because they are certain things that appear strange," Ghouri said.Estonian and Finnish oil spill response vessels are working on cleaning up the oil spill caused by the sinking of the Runner 4. The Dominican-registered ship sank on March 6 near the Estonian coast in the Gulf of Finland.This oil disaster may be even worse than the one of February, which was described by the BBC as the worst oil spill that Estonia has ever experienced. In the February spill, approximately 35 000 birds died. According to The Baltic Times, specialists say that this time up to 40 tons of oil might have leaked into the sea from the Runner 4. The ship was carrying, according to MTV3, over 100 tons of heavy fuel oil and 35 tons of light fuel oil.The ship Runner 4 sank due to a collision with another ship, in a convoy following a Russian icebreaker. The crew managed to leave the ship before it sank.On March 13, a week after the ship sank, the Estonian Border Guard sent its multipurpose vessel EVA-316 to the site to start the oil cleanup. Around the same time, the Finnish dedicated to the cleanup the oil spill response vessels Hylje, Halli and Seili.  Also, the Finnish Frontier Guard patrol ship Merikarku was sent to the site to conduct underwater robot examinations of the sunken ship. According to the Finnish Environment Institute press briefing on this, [1] Estonia does not have adequate equipment for oil spill response in icy conditions, so help was needed.The reaction to the disaster is criticized by Jouni Pirttijärvi, an inspector at the Finnish Environment Institute (Ympäristökeskus). He says, according to Finland's national broadcasting company (YLE), that the countermeasures should have started a week ago, immediately after the disaster, instead of now. He said, "It's difficult now to get the oil under control. It's spread all around, and ship traffic is spreading it further. We should have come here a week ago. Then the oil would have been closer to the disaster area [the ship's sinking site]. We weren't asked for help [by the Estonians] then, so now we decided to help without asking [before it's too late]." (Translation from the Finnish-language original). [2]Finland will be paying the costs of the cleanup, as Estonia did  not make an official request for help. The Estonian Border Guard's representative Helena Loorents says that Finland was not asked for help, as every day spent in the cleaning costs a lot of money. Estonia simply cannot afford this.According to Urmas Raudsepp, the director of Estonia's Institute of Marine Research, the oil spill's location was only found out on Thursday March 16. The Finnish ships had, however, arrived at the site on the day before.Jouni Pirttijärvi also said that the conditions in the site are bad. The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining. The oil spill is moving into waters too shallow for the three Finnish vessels, so they can no longer do their job. Hylje will be heading back to Finland on March 19 and the other two might follow within a few days. According to the Estonian paper Postimees, the oil spill is now a kilometer (0.6 mile) away from the Estonian capital of Tallinn.The death toll has risen to 16 confirmed dead and an unconfirmed number of people are injured in another fire south of Paris, France. Investigators say the fire was caused by arson. 4 people have arrested, 3 are teenage girls (18 to 16 years old).The fire occurred early Sunday morning in an apartment building in the southern suburb of l'Haÿ-les-Roses.It is known that 13 people were taken to hospital with injuries. One woman was in labor and gave birth at the scene. She was then taken to hospital with her baby.The blaze reportedly originated in the entrance hall mailboxes. The flames were put out quickly, but people died by inhaling the fumes. The problem with the fumes seems to have been compounded by a panic movement, whereby inhabitants opened doors leading to staircases — enabling the fumes to fill some upper parts of the building. Earlier this year there were several well-publicized deadly fires in central Paris. This fire is the fourth in five months.An earthquake measuring 6.3 or 6.4 (according to preliminary data) on the Richter scale hit Indonesia today, days after a larger earthquake hit the same region and triggered a tsunami and killed at least 520 people. The earthquake struck the Sunda Straits separating the islands of Sumatra and Java.  There are no immediate reports of damages. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that the quake posed no risk of a tsunami, being too small in magnitude. The US Geological Survey has reported the magnitude of the quake as 6.0.Less than one week after the College La Promesse Evangelique in Pétionville, Haiti collapsed, a second school in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, has partially collapsed injuring nine people.The Grace Divine school partially collapsed while school was in session, but no one was trapped or killed. At least two people were transported to an area hospital with serious injuries. Reports state that most of the children attending the school, were outside playing in the playground when the collapse occurred.An investigation is being conducted, but authorities believe that the collapse could have been caused by recent heavy rains in the region.On November 7, 89 people were killed and over 150 were injured when the three story College La Promesse Evangelique collapsed. Authorities say that there are at least 200 people missing, all believed to buried in the rubble. Eight years ago the same school partially collapsed and authorities say that poor reconstruction was to blame for the incident. At least 700 children were attending class when it collapsed.Two sinkholes have opened near the Australian northern coastal city of Newcastle, New South Wales, in the last two days. The first appeared yesterday with another opening today, both developing by houses on Lambton Parade in the suburb of Swansea Heads.The first sinkhole measured around twenty metres across and ten metres deep, while the second sinkhole was much smaller, measuring around two metres across. The first hole swallowed tonnes of material in two hours next to a married couple's home before they returned to discover it.The street is over a coal mine abandoned in 1950s and this appears to be contributing to the instability of the land.The Mine Subsidence Board is investigating the two sinkholes and safety of other homes in the area. Dozens of homes have been built over the mine since its closure.  The house involved in the first, larger sinkhole dates from the 1990s, making it relatively new on the street, and the damage to it may be fixable, according to mine subsidence board members.Sinkholes can occur naturally when bedrock erodes due to acidic rainwater seeping from the surface, or, as in this case, they can occur when houses are built on top of old mines.There have been a series of security alerts in London this morning.Euston, Liverpool Street Station, and Charing Cross train stations have all reopened after they were closed at some point after earlier alerts proved to be false alarms.According to police in Buffalo, New York, no one was injured after a semi-trailer truck  carrying paper from  Ontario, Canada hit a railroad viaduct, tearing the truck in half.At approximately 11:00 p.m. EDT (UTC-4) on April 21, an unidentified man driving the truck westbound on Walden Avenue between Wasmuth and Roetzer streets hit the viaduct which tore his truck in half sending debris and cargo over most of the road.Police describe the truck's cabin as a "can of sardines.""He made it all the way through, but his truck looks like a can of sardines," said officers on police radio communications who were on scene. The driver was given a traffic citation and admits he did not notice signs posted along Walden which state the bridge's clearance.The street and the viaduct remained closed into the early morning hours of Tuesday April 22. According to Don Poleto of the city's Public Works office, the bridge was not damaged.A court in Paraguay has completed its trial over the worst fire disaster the country has ever seen. The Ycuá Bolaños supermarket fire in Asunción left 374 dead, 450 others injured and nine missing, presumed dead.Store owner Juan Pio Paiva, 64, received 12 years imprisonment whilst his son Daniel Paiva, 40, was given 10 years. A security guard, Daniel Areco, was given a five-year sentence while three business associates of the Paivas were cleared of any criminal activity.2,000 people were in the store when fire broke out on August 1, 2004, including many families with young children. Fire doors were shut to prevent looting, worsening the situation.The investigation found that flames broke out in a badly built chimney because of inadequately maintained equipment. A lack of fire escapes, fire detection system and fire suppression system all contributed to the disaster. Most of the deaths were caused by asphyxiation due to the smoke. The nine missing bodies are believed to have been completely destroyed by the extreme temperature.Paiva senior was convicted on the basis that as the owner and chief administrator of the business, including the building, he was responsible for overall safety. His son was responsible for the food court area, the site where the blaze started. The security guard was convicted for blocking the exits, although he was acting on senior orders. The three other businessmen were acquitted as they were not involved in the administration of the store.The Paivas were both convicted of manslaughter and exposing people to danger within the workplace. Areco was found guilty of negligence.The three judge tribunal was headed by German Torres. It replaced an earlier trial in 2006, when the court announced that it was 2-1 in favour of more lenient sentences, but got no further as friends and relatives stormed the courtroom and rioted in the streets outside. The court had been going to hand out five-year sentences to the Paivas.A peaceful protest was also held at yesterday's verdict, with demonstrators shouting "Assassins! Assassins!" and "This kind of justice is injustice!" Ten women who lost relatives fainted in the heat and were hospitalised. The protestors were pressing for those involved to receive the maximum possible sentence of 25 years. One, Lys Torres, vowed to use the appeals courts to press for tougher sentences. "Its an outrage. They're responsible for the death of 400 people and they've been given ridiculous sentences," said Lys, who is a spokeswoman for the relatives and survivors group. "This shows that in this country, people with money can kill with impunity," Bersabe Meza, who lost her husband in the fire, said.Chief prosecuter Edgar Sanchez, who had also requested maximum sentences, said "My conscience is clear. I've done my job."Meanwhile, relatives laid out a white plastic chair in the streets for each of those killed, adorned with signs bearing such notices as "If there is no justice, the people will rise up."The ruined store remains standing, graffitied and adorned in tribute to those who died.After eight years, the 9/11 attacks have been remembered in New York, in the United States at the site of the former World Trade Center. Other memorial services were held at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.U.S. President Barack Obama attended a memorial service at the Pentagon. In a speech Obama stated, "Eight Septembers have come and gone. Nearly 3,000 days have passed; almost one for each of those taken from us.  But no turning of the season can diminish the pain and the loss of that day.  No passage of time and no dark skies can ever dull the meaning of this moment. So on this solemn day, at this sacred hour, once more we pause, once more we pray, as a nation and as a people. Today we honor the dead and speak to the survivors and loved ones whose lives are irrevocably changed on that terrible day eight years ago."The names of every one of the 2,752 New York victims was read out. A new name appeared on the list today, that of Leon Heyward who died of lung cancer in 2008 that experts ruled was due to inhaling dangerous dust from the collapsed towers in New York City. He was on-site for hours assisting with rescues of colleagues.Short eulogies were read by both New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and vice-president Joe Biden. Bloomberg said that "from this day forward, we will safeguard the memories of those who died by rekindling the spirit of service that lit our city with hope and helped keep us strong."At exactly 8:46 a.m. a hush fell across the city, marking the exact moment the first jet struck its target. Two beams of light have been rigged up to point skywards overnight. Construction is ongoing for five new skyscrapers at the site, with a transportation center and memorial park in the middle.Santa Cruz, Chile — An aftershock earthquake that reached a magnitude of 4.9 on the Richter magnitude scale struck Chile yesterday at 11:14 local time (15:14 UTC). The epicentre was in the Maule Region. The aftershock lasted about fifteen or twenty seconds.According to the ONEMI (National Emergencies Office), it had an intensity of five Mercalli grades in the coastal area of Pelluhue, four in Cauquenes, Chanco, San Javier, and Longaví, and three in Pencahue. The US Geological Survey reported that the epicentre was located in the sea, at a depth of 25,5 kilometers, and 115 kilometers west of Talca.There were no reports of damage or injuries. Previously, at 08:30 am local time (12:30 UTC), another aftershock reached 5.0 on the Richter scale and was clearly felt in the Bío Bío Region. The epicenter was located at a depth of 35 kilometers, and 55 kilometers northeast from Concepción.A minor aftershock, with epicentre in Pichilemu, reached a magnitude of 3.6 in the Richter scale at 15:11 local time (19:11 UTC), as reported the University of Chile's Geological Survey.Damages in Chile surpass the 30.000 million U.S. dollars. The most affected regions by the aftershocks are the Bío Bío Region, Valparaíso, Maule and O'Higgins. Almost 350 aftershocks have been felt in these areas since the February 27 earthquake.At 23:58 local time (03:58 UTC), a medium intensity aftershock between 2 and 6 grades in the Richter scale occurred, in the Maule, O'Higgins, Valparaíso, and Santiago Metropolitan regions.  The epicenter was located near Talca, as ONEMI reported, where the aftershock was felt with more intensity.  In Curicó, Río Claro and Yerbas Buenas, it reached 5 grades in the Richter scale; in Parral, Linares, Retiro, and Cauquenes, it reached 3 grades; in Rancagua and San Fernando, 4 grades; in Pichilemu, 2 grades; and in Santiago de Chile and San Antonio, 2 grades.  ONEMI has not reported damage or injuries.Another 4 medium intensity aftershocks took place after Talca's:  at 01:17 AM local time (05:17 UTC), reaching 3.9 grades, with epicentre near Constitución; 4.7 grades at 09:59 local time (13:59 UTC), with epicentre near Pichilemu; at the 10:57 local time (14:57 UTC) reaching 5.1 grades, with epicentre almost twenty kilometers at the north of Cobquecura; and a 3.9 grades at the 12:20, with epicentre near Pichilemu.The Serbian Pilots Association has defended the actions of the Serbian pilot aboard the Air India Express jet that crashed earlier this year, killing 158 of the 166 on board. Investigators have suggested he had failed to follow procedure and reacted slowly to trouble.The Court of Inquiry found that captain Zlatko Glusica was sleeping through much of the three-hour Dubai–Mangalore flight and "disorientated" as the Boeing 737-800 came in to land; it overshot the clifftop runway on May 22 and ran over the edge. In the immediate aftermath of the crash, one survivor said: "Immediately on touching the ground, the aircraft jerked and in a few moments hit something. Then it split in the middle and caught fire. I just jumped from the gap."The pilots' group has said Gluscia was fatigued owing to "pressures" flying in India and said he should not be "victimised". The airport the aircraft had been attempting to land at is considered a challenging one, as it is on a flat plateau bordered by a valley. A former official from India's aviation ministry said that "Mangalore is a difficult field because it is on a plateau. From all accounts the visibility was all right. One can’t make any conclusions."Pilots questioned the role of First Officer H S Ahluwalia, who three times requested a go around during approach. "He should have taken over the controls, provided he was experienced and had the confidence to do so," one pilot said; another asked "[w]hat was the First Officer doing all the while? The non-handling pilot should take over the control if he or she thinks there’s going to be a crash, instead of sitting like a robot."A statement by the association said "[t]he individualisation of guilt ... is intended to shift the responsibility from those who have driven the crew and the passengers to death." They feel the investigation "created an ugly picture about the Serbian pilots... without taking into account the circumstances" leading to the accident.Serbian firefighters battling fires in the Kuršumlija area, near the administrative line with Kosovo have reportedly been shot at by Albanians from the Podujevo municipality in Kosovo. Since then, firefighters were denied access to the area.“Firefighters heard automatic gunfire and temporarily withdrew from the area, while the fire began to spread nearer to the Kuršumlija villages,” a forestry engineer said.A Mig-29 jet fighter of the Serbian Air Force and Air Defense crashed near Belgrade, Serbia, on Tuesday.The pilot ejected from the airplane and was transferred to military hospital. Lt. Col. Rade Randjelovic, aged 47, suffered serious injuries and died at the hospital.  A soldier located on the ground was also killed, and another injured.Randjelovic was conducting a training flight at the time of the accident and was preparing for the Belgrade aircraft acrobatics show.The Serbian Air Force has five MiG-29s which were repaired between 2007 and 2008 at a cost of €15m (£13 m).  The cause of the crash is still unknown, pending an official investigation.On Friday at 10:20 a.m, a 4.7-magnitude earthquake struck the province of Elazig, Turkey.On Sunday at 11:30 a.m. (1030GMT), a 3.8-magnitude earthquake hit southern Norway.

Five are reported to be in comas. Four are known as dead.Juela Mecani, spokesperson for Albamian PM Sali Berisha, said to Reuters "We do not know the exact number (of casualties) but we fear the worst for the three teams, each of 21 people, working there at the time. Several were U.S. citizens." The three teams referred to were dismantling obsolete munitions stored there, as part of a programme to remove Stalinist era arms and modernize the military in order to qualify for an invitation to join NATO next month.Injured people have been rushed to hospitals amid ongoing explosions, which Interior Ministry spokesman Avni Neza says have prevented helicopters landing in the area. The wounded are suffering from burns, concussion, broken limbs and shrapnel injuries. Meanwhile, Neza says police and army units are attempting to reach the area in armored cars. Albanian health minister Nard Ndoka said that the 155 known to be hospitalized so far had to make their way to nearby villages as the ongoing explosions had also prevented road ambulances reaching the scene. Explosions have been ongoing at least two hours.Tirana Airport spokesman Arlinda Causholli said glass windows and doors at the airport, a few kilometers from the site, were shattered by the initial series of explosions. "We evacuated passengers from the affected area and suspended flights for around 30 minutes," he said. A Reuters cameraman in the area described the scene. "Terrified people are leaving the area on foot along the highway, women and children... Cars with broken windows have been abandoned on the highway." Local media reports Tirana residents rushing to donate blood to help with the emergency.Explosions were felt in Tirana and in Durres, 20km (12 miles) from the base. In the nearby village of Gerdec, some residents fled to the hills, while others sought shelter in concrete bunkers built by late Stalinist leader Enver Hoxha. The initial blast was heard 150km away in Macedonia and SerbiaA memorial service has been held in Nova Scotia, Canada to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Swissair Flight 111 disaster. None of the 229 people on board survived the aircraft's impact with the sea on September 2, 1998.Hundreds of search and rescue personnel and local fishermen were mobilised after the crash in St. Margaret's Bay near Halifax to recover fragments of both the aircraft and the victims. The state of the human remains was such that identifying them resulted in what would remain the largest DNA identification operation up until the World Trade Centre collapsed.At the ceremony, attended by around 100 people, 229 heart-shaped stones crafted from beach rocks and simply decorated with painted stars flowers and hearts were available for the mourners to take and place at the foot of the memorial at Bayswater, one for each of the 229 names upon the granite monument. Many flowers were also laid there.The aircraft was a wide-bodied jet which had departed John F.Kennedy International Airport in New York at 8:18 p.m. 53 minutes after takeoff pilot Urs Zimmerman and co-pilot Stephan Loew smelt smoke in the cockpit and within three more minutes smoke was visible. The plane, by then in Canadian airspace, tried to reach Halifax Airport but never made it, hitting the water at around 9:31 p.m. at 350 mph (563 kph).The cause of the disaster was determined to be highly flammable insulating foam, which caught light after an arcing electrical wire triggered a small fire. The fire was ferocious enough to destroy critical power cables, leaving the aircraft uncontrollable.The investigation was one of aviation's costliest and most complicated, costing the Transportation Safety Bureau of Canada $60 million. The TSB produced 23 recommendations to prevent a recurance of the disaster, but only five have been implemented in the decade since the crash, including some flammable material restrictions and electrical safety improvements.Several people at the hour-long multi-faith ceremony complained at the perceived lack of action. "How come after 10 years we are hearing reports that only five of some 20 recommendations for airplanes have been carried out? What has gone wrong with the bureaucracy - the inertia for that?" asked Rabbi David Ellis. John Butt, who headed the identification effort as Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner at the time, said it was 'disappointing' that action had not been taken and that it was "not very good to think about flying in an aircraft when you know recommendations have been made about the standards of safety and they haven't been adopted."TSB member Jonathan Seymour was also critical of the lack of action, particularly on the US Federal Aviation Administration's part. "It's just that obviously after 10 years you would have hoped that things would have moved on quite significantly further than they have. It's frustrating that we're still that far away from where we might want to be after 10 years," he said.Fourteen houses have been destroyed and another 3 damaged by a bush fire burning in Jarrah forests and farmland near the historical timber town of Dwellingup 70km south east of Perth, Western Australia. The fire has also destroyed approximately 100 power poles, leading to a loss of telecommunication services to the town and affecting water supplies. Mobile generators have been installed for emergency power. Steve Slavin, spokesman for Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC), said that 250 fire-fighters are containing the fire with crews concentrating on the southern front, which is now within 3 km of the town. Mr Slavin said "Our concern is that winds this afternoon will be swinging around to the south and increasing in intensity."  "It's making us nervous. The advice we're giving to people in Dwellingup is if they've decided that they will leave, this would be a good time to do it" In separate fires near North Yunderup, Greenfields and Parkland have affected transmission lines supplying power to approximately 56,000 properties. Additional fires are burning near Toodyay 85km north east of Perth, Another fire is burning near Williams approximately 160 south east of Perth and 90Km east of Dwellingup. And in the southern rural suburb of Forrestdale. These fires are reported to be under control.Western Australian Police Arson squad are investigating these fires as some appear to be deliberately lit. The Police are also investigating  the death of a women in her mid 20's who died on Saturday after her car rolled while fleeing the fire near Toodyay.Officials say that a French military helicopter with 10 French soldiers, including four crew members and six Special Forces paratroopers, has crashed off the coast of Gabon in west central Africa.The Eurocopter AS 532 Cougar ditched shortly into the Atlantic Ocean after leaving a French naval ship, about 50 kilometres off the coast. Seven French soldiers were killed, two were rescued, and one is still missing, according to a statement issued by President Nicolas Sarkozy's office. "Today, the wreckage of the helicopter was located at a depth of 35 metres and searched. Unfortunately, we must report the deaths of five other soldiers. A final soldier remains missing. Searches are continuing," the statement explained.According to Libreville Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Carpentier, the ill-fated helicopter crashed Saturday night at 8:08 p.m. (1908 GMT) into Atlantic waters off Nyonie, a small town located between Gabon's capital Libreville and the town of Port-Gentil. It was taking off from the amphibious assault ship La Foudre's naval landing craft transporter cruising 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the Gabonese coast, during a joint training exercise, said Lieutenant Colonel Francois-Marie Gougeon, spokesman for the general staff.The ship "set off the alert and arrived at the crash site with  rescuers who picked up the injured crew within half an hour. The sea was calm and the wind low at the time of the crash but the night was very dark," Lieutenant Gougeon explained, adding that "search operations will naturally continue all night." La Foudre, two helicopters and oil giant Total S.A.'s three vessels, including its sonar and underwater robot joined the rescue effort of the salvage team. "Divers were deployed to locate the wreckage," said Captain Christophe Prazuck, spokesman for the army general staff. "At daybreak we will deploy all our means, planes, helicopters, boats... to take part in the search," said Gabon's Interior Minister André Mba Obame.Meanwhile French President Nicolas Sarkozy directed Defence Minister Hervé Morin to travel to the crash site. Sarkozy had "asked that all available means in the area be immediately deployed to find the soldiers who were aboard."Morin later announced there would be two probes, a judicial one and another by the French defence ministry, with the assistance of French gendarmes and an air accident expert. Minister Morin arrived in Libreville on Sunday and met with President Omar Bongo to discuss rescue efforts for the missing body of one of the seven soldiers. "The cause of this tragedy remains unknown. It may be natural or human, or a combination of both." Morin said. "Divers were inspecting the Cougar, which was in water 35 meters (about 115 feet) deep. We will do everything we can to find the last person missing," he added. Morin viewed rescue efforts on La Foudre, and visited friends and relatives of the missing at Camp DeGaulle. The French soldiers were "permanent personnel in Gabon who knew the region well," said General Claude Reglat, Gabon commander of French forces. "The six others were commandos who had arrived from the French army's elite 13th Regiment of Dragon Paratroopers. We have expressed our compassion and solidarity to the families," he added.“This type of helicopter does not have a black box. So the flight was not recorded, nor were the voices in the cockpit. So some elements will remain unknown,” Claude Reglat also noted.The January 17-21 bilateral manoeuvres called 'Operation N'Gari' involved 600 French soldiers and 120 Gabonese troops maneuvering in the military drill known as Baptise Ngeri. The soldiers were backed by Cougar and Fennec helicopters to coordinate maritime safety operations with UN peacekeepers at Bouna airport, in the Ivory Coast. In the joint exercise soldiers were to be parachuted onto predetermined targets including Nyonie.  Gabon, a former French colony, hosts one of four permanent French bases in Africa. Gabon is a country in west central Africa sharing borders with the Gulf of Guinea to the west, Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, and Cameroon to the north, with the Republic of the Congo curving around the east and south. According the FFG which has around 1,000 troops in Gabon, the French Forces in Gabon (FFG)'s role is "to assure the safety of the 12,000 French residents in the country in case of threat, and carry out aid missions."A gas explosion in the Grand Riviera Princess resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico earlier today killed seven people and left 20 people injured, two critically according to local officials. Francisco Alor, the attorney general of Quintana Roo, said that two hotel employees were among the dead. Five Canadian tourists were also killed in the blast, which created a large crater and broke windows. Alor said it is suspected that the explosion took place under the floor of the lobby. Reports from guests say that the explosion occurred at about 9:30 a.m. local time (1530 UTC). News director of Canadian radio station 570 Pete Traves said, "People are visibly shaken and upset, as you can imagine." Traves witnessed hotel employees rushing around after the explosion helping injured guests. It was also reported the local hospital was bogged down with people. Traves is at the resort with a group of 60 Canadians; they are staying in a wing of the hotel unaffected by the blast.At least seven died in a double attack in Falluja, Iraq today. The attack occurred near a military checkpoint in the western Anbar province of the country. 29 were wounded in the attack.According to officials, the attacks occurred successively, at around 9:00 am (06:00 GMT) in the city, 30 kilometers from the capital, Baghdad. Captain Bashar Mohammed, a police station chief in the city, said the bomber parked his vehicle full of explosives close to a military checkpoint in the central part of the city.The attacker then left it and detonated his explosives vest near a group of laborers. The bomb in the car, parked about 150 meters from the checkpoint, exploded shortly afterwards. No soldiers were wounded, according to officials. The death toll was confirmed by Ahmed Abdul Halim, a local medic."The blast rocked the area and I found myself suddenly on the floor," said 30-year-old Mohammed Abdullah, a shopkeeper who was one of the victims. "Once I saw the smoke and the burning car, I immediately knew it was a bomb," he added.Seven people were killed and fourteen injured after a man detonated explosives in a crowd Friday around 10:30 local time in Aksu, Xinjiang, China. Most of the victims of the blast were ethnic minorities.The man allegedly drove a three-wheeled vehicle armed with explosives into a crowd. The man suspected of detonating the bomb was detained, after sustaining injuries from the blast. His name is still unknown to authorities, although they do know he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group. "The suspect is a Uighur. Most of the victims are Uighurs too," said government spokesperson Hou Hanmin.Hou stated that police believe the attack was intentional.In response to the bombing, martial law has been declared in Aksu City.A bus crash in France's Loire Valley has left seven of the Moroccan passengers dead. 22 of the 32 on board were injured, four critically, after the bus smashed into a concrete pillar on the A10 near Blois in the small hours of yesterday morning.The bus had departed Tiznit in South Morocco on Wednesday and was headed to the Parisian suburb of Les Mureaux. It had been hired by Aziz, a French company that provides buses to tourists and small traders heading between France and Morocco.Media images show the vehicle's front end stuck several feet up the pilar, with the roof trapped against the top of the bridge it supported by the pillar. The entire wreck is left leaning at about a forty degree angle back towards the road, and has left the road at a fairly steep angle directly into the pillar. The remains of a trailer it was towing can be seen still attached at the rear of the coach. Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau, who visited the scene shortly after the accident, said that “The incredible state of the bus showed that the impact was extremely violent.”The pictures showed the bus was in the livery of travel company Labat.The French Interior Ministry took the rare step of activating an emergency plan to ensure rapid response from large numbers of rescuers and resources. The scene was attended by four helicopters, 140 firefighters and 25 police officers, who had to free multiple victims from the wreck. The A10 was closed off.Six died immediately, and the seventh victim died shortly afterwards. All the deceased were adults, and included one of the two drivers, the other of whom was seriously injured. It is unclear which was driving at the time.Investigators believe no other vehicles were involved, but the exact circumstances remain unclear. "It looks like a loss of control. Is this linked to a mechanical problem, drowsiness or a totally different cause?" Bussereau said at the scene. His ministry's accident investigation bureau will conduct a major investigation inquiry, and a separate investigation will be launched by local prosecuters.One possible cause is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel. Investigators are also examining the bus to try to determine any sign of mechanical trouble. There was good weather in the region of the town of Suevres, where the accident occurred, and very little traffic was using the road at the time, thought to be around 2.50am (0050 GMT).Morocco's King Mohammed VI has announced he will personally pay for care of the injured and repatriation of those killed. He also asked the ambassador to France to pass on his condolences.At least seven inmates have died and 23 were injured after multiple mortar rounds struck a prison in Baghdad, Iraq. The facility is located near an interior ministry complex, on the Eastern bank of the River Tigris in the central part of the capital, and it is thought that this could have been the intended target of the attack.The attack took place while inmates were sleeping, at 6:30 a.m. local time (UTC+3). The prison building was organised as several cell blocks, each accommodating men charged with terrorism-related offenses or "civil offenses", the Associated Press quoted an anonymous police source as saying.One of the rounds struck a cell directly, while two more were confirmed to have landed in close proximity, coming within 200 yard of the main ministry building. The wounded were transported to a hospital within the nearby interior ministry site. It is understood that several police officers were among the injured. American troops have locked down the area and are investigating the attack.Also today, a large fire broke out at the city's only oil refinery. Early reports based on statements made by Iraqi authorities suggested that the Doura plant had been the subject of rocket attack, but United States officials in Iraq have later blamed it on an industrial accident, saying an explosion had occurred after the failure of a pipeline. Due to the facility's highly sensitive nature it has been the target of several previous insurgent attacks.At least seventeen people were admitted to an Oxford hospital after a coach, operated by the Oxford Tube service, overturned while exiting the M40 motorway near Thame, Saturday evening. There were no other vehicles involved according to Thames Valley Police.The incident took place at around 2300 GMT Saturday night at junction seven of the M40 near Milton Common, when a coach, belonging to the Oxford Tube service, overturned on a slip road. A police spokesperson stated "The exit slip at junction seven was closed, as well as the A329 in both directions either side of the M40. The coach is in the process of being recovered from the motorway." The motorway itself remained open.Sergeant Steve Blackburn of Thames Valley Police stated that "The vast majority [of passengers] were walking wounded or not injured at all and were released either at the scene or shortly after receiving some treatment."John Nixon from Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue noted that the coach was lying on its side on an embankment, stating that his crews' priority had been to stabilise the coach. He added, "There were people laid on the side of the embankment, on the road, covered in space-type blankets to keep them warm" Although there were no fatalities, five of the injured required surgery, which was undertaken at Oxford's John Radcliffe hospital. Of the other admissions, a number were discharged by Sunday morning.A spokesperson for the Oxford Tube was quoted by the BBC as stating that, "Safety is our absolute priority and our immediate thoughts are with those who have been injured in the accident." They added, "We will be carrying out our own internal investigation and assisting the police in any way that we can with their inquiries into the accident."Police have already begun an investigation into the cause of the accident and have requested witnesses come forward.Seventeen soldiers have died today as the result of a helicopter crash in Turkey's southeastern Siirt Province, Governor Ahmed Aydin has said. The provincial governor added that the fatalities belonged to Turkish special forces.Investigations into the crash are ongoing, although Governor Ahmed Aydin has said the aircraft hit Herekol mountain as it travelled through heavy fog.The soldiers were reportedly on their way to deployment against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  The PKK seeks to increase rights for Kurdish citizens and gain autonomy in the southeast of Turkey, which is a predominantly Kurdish area. The Turkish Government have been fighting with the PKK for decades.Kurdish militants, though active in this part of Turkey, do not appear to have played any part in the crash.Seven bombs exploded Tuesday at various local railway stations in the city of Mumbai, India between 6:24 pm and 6:35 pm IST (GMT+5:30).The first blast ripped through the first-class compartment of a local train from Churchgate to Borivali, near the Khar station. Subsequent blasts occurred at Bhayandar station near Mira Road, Mahim station, Matunga, Jogeshwari and Borivali. A seventh blast has occurred in the Khar-Santacruz subway. Local phone lines in Mumbai have been jammed. The Press Trust of India, quoting railway officials, said all seven explosions had targeted first-class cars. An eighth bomb was later defused at the Borivali station.According to official report at least 183 people have died and over 714 were injured in the blasts, although the figures could rise given the fact that Western Railway trains are very crowded during the evening rush hour. Police are reportedly conducting raids throughout India in response to the bombings. Officials in Mumbai claim the explosions were a deliberate attack. India's Home Minister Shivraj Patil said authorities had "some" information that an attack was coming "but place and time was not known". Heavy monsoon downpours have hampered the rescue efforts of the emergency services.The Indian capital New Delhi has reportedly been put on high alert after the blasts. Airports across the country are also on high alert as are sensitive installations in Mumbai. Mumbai's train system has been suspended and calls are made to keep the public away from the city's train stations. Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh called a emergency cabinet meeting and then released a statement saying that the bombings which have hit India lately are "shocking and cowardly attempts to spread a feeling of fear and terror among our citizens". The country's leading opposition party, BJP, claimed that the current policies of the government put the country in danger for terrorism.There has been no claim of responsibility, but the attack has the trademarks of Kashmiri Islamic terrorist groups like the Lashkar-e-Toiba. The group is known to have has set off bombs in quick succession in Indian cities before. India's domestic intelligence agency, the Intelligence Bureau, claims that this attack, as also the grenade attacks in Jammu and Kashmir earlier today were aimed at diverting attention from the elections being held in Pakistani Kashmir.A terrorist and key supplier of explosives were arrested in Jangpura area of Central Delhi on Monday after a tip-off. The police recovered 2 kg of RDX, an explosive widely used by the military, in his possession. The police are interrogating him to find out if he had anything to do with the recent bombings.Sunday, a fire rushed through seven businesses at the Whitestone Shopping Center in Whitestone, Queens, New York, near the Cross Island Parkway in New York City.The fire started at around 1:00 AM EST (UTC-5) on November 2, 2008 in a diner known as Lollipops. According to local sources, Lollipops was a popular restaurant in the area. The fire spread through the stores, up an awning and continued all the way to a corner of the shopping center. In the end, seven businesses were destroyed, including two banks, two restaurants and a GNC Nutrition Center. It took dozens of firefighters to put out the large blaze.According to WCBS-TV, with his diner Lollipops destroyed, the owner was too upset to comment.Nearby Chinese restaurant, King's Chef, was also damaged. "I cannot open because of whatever rules – tomorrow's Monday, Tuesday is a holiday," the owner, Patrick Chan, told WCBS-TV. "If I cannot get them to come tomorrow, I am going to lose big time."Nearby residents reacted to the situation. Several residents have reported that it is a major loss to the community as they considered Lollipops to be a landmark. Several residents have reported knowing members of either the victim stores or others in the strip mall. State Senator Frank Padavan commented on the loss of the shopping center."This is a calamity for many of these small businesses to be out of business, particularly in this economy," he said.The next day, investigators were boarding up the windows of the damaged stores. No one was hurt because all the stores were closed at the time of the blaze.Reports say that 4 people, including a paramedic and a retired firefighter have been killed after a gas station near Ghent, West Virginia in Raleigh County blew up. At least 9 others have been critically injured.The explosion occurred at 10:50 a.m. [EST] at the Flat Top Little General Store, and fire officials say that the cause may have been from a nearby propane tank that was leaking. The gas station was completely wiped out. Officials say that a full investigation will be launched to determine exactly what caused the blast.The company that stocks the tank with gas had sent out a representative, who officials believe was killed in the explosion.Fire and rescue squads are continuing to search for victims.Witnesses say that the explosion could be felt as far as 1 mile away. Ben Monast, who owns a ski shop about a mile away from the scene, said that he "thought we got struck by lightning. The whole building shook and the power went off."An elementary school that is close to the scene was not damaged, but students were kept inside for safety purposes.Several small earthquakes have been reported near Wells, Nevada after a large magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck the region at 6:16 a.m. PST (UTC-8).The 6.0 quake, centered 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Wells had a depth of 5.6 miles (9 km) and caused at least 25 buildings to collapse. Damage to other buildings and windows was also reported, and at least two water mains were ruptured. Several cars were hit by bricks as they fell off buildings. One person was hospitalized for a broken arm, but no other injuries were reported.At least 30 aftershocks ranging from a magnitude 2.0 to 4.0 have been reported since the early morning quake. The quake could be felt as far away as California, Idaho and Utah.Officials in Nevada are currently inspecting roads and dams in the region for damage. FEMA is also on their way to the area to help in the inspections.Ibrahim Jaafari, the Prime Minister of Iraq, has declared that Iraq will hold three days of national mourning following a stampede on a bridge in Baghdad which left nearly a thousand people dead. The railings of a bridge over the River Tigris gave way under the weight of the crowd, and many people fell into the waters below. CNN now reports the death toll as 965 dead and 465 injured.The people were walking towards the Kadhimiya mosque, a Shi'ite shrine. They were celebrating the martyrdom of Muslim religious figure Musa Al-Kadhim.Some sources say the rush happened after a rumor of the presence of a suicide bomber passed through the crowd of up to one million.Earlier, three to six mortar rounds were fired into the crowd, killing as many as 16 - a US Apache gunship helicopter returned fire on the attackers.A family of six were injured at Flat Rock Bridge Family Resort and campground in Lebanon, Maine after a severe thunderstorm caused trees to topple, with one landing on a tent. A 10-year-old girl was critically injured after a tree fell on the tent she was sleeping in. Witnesses say the girl was pinned under the tree for at least 10 minutes before they were able to remove it.Witnesses also say the day was beautiful and sunny, but at around 6:00 p.m. (EDT) a storm rolled in, darkening the sky, followed by heavy winds and rain. Witnesses describe a "funnel-like wind" which lifted items off the ground and threw them around. The strong winds then brought down trees and limbs, with one landing on the family's campsite and tent. Severe lightning was also reported."The female patient was loaded into Lebanon Ambulance One and transported to Frisbie Hospital in Rochester to be stabilized and then was transferred to the trauma center at Maine Medical Center. Her injuries were considered critical and life threatening when she left the scene," said Jason Cole, the assistant rescue chief for the area. The victims names have not been released and the girl's current condition is not yet known.Rescuers responding to the scene noticed several other trees and limbs scattered around other campsites and searched all 350 sites, but no other injuries were reported. Other campers say they had several close calls with tree limbs and debris. At least 12 trees were reported to have toppled during the storm. The family's car was also destroyed when a tree limb landed on it.The National Weather Service in Maine says it will investigate whether or not the storm produced a tornado.As many as eight people have been injured after two cable cars collided at the Nevis Range near Fort William in Scotland.Two RAF helicopters, an air ambulance, four ambulance crews, police, fire brigade and a mountain rescue team are among those present. Police have confirmed that three people have been injured,  including one child. Injuries include broken legs, head and chest injuries. The Scottish Ambulance Service have reported that up to seven people had been thrown on to the hillside. A reporter at the scene said one car near the top of the mountain had slid down a cable, hitting another and then one of the cars fell to the ground.Northern Constabulary have stated "It's understood that two gondolas would appeared to have collided and a number of casualties have been reported. The local mountain rescue team, Inverness helimed and other air support are in attendance to remove casualties".The Doppelmayr gondola system is made up of eighty six-seat closed cabins running on a continuous 4.6km steel cable.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), several large earthquakes have shaken Indonesia with the largest having a magnitude of 7.0.The most recent quake had a magnitude of 6.4 and struck at 4:02 a.m. local time February 26, 150 kilometers (94 miles) south, southwest of Padang, Sumatra, Indonesia. The depth registered at 35 km (21.7 miles). The USGS earlier reported it as a 6.9.The largest and first had a magnitude of 7.0 and occurred just over a half hour before. It was located 160 miles from Padang. The USGS initially reported the quake as a magnitude 7.2.The 7.0 quake caused the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to issue a local tsunami bulletin stating that small waves were generated with larger ones close to the quake's epicenter.A half dozen smaller quakes ranging from 5.0 to 6.0 have occurred in the same area since February 24.So far, there are no reports of damage or injuries in any of the quakes.Parts of the English Lake District in the county of Cumbria have suffered severe flooding on Thursday, with forecasters predicting further rain. As of 21:09 GMT there were six severe flood warnings (the highest alert in the UK Flood Warnings system) in force in the county, with a large number of flood warnings and watches also in force across the region.According to BBC News, the main street in the town of Cockermouth is under several feet of water, and around 200 people were being evacuated by helicopters. At least 350 homes in the Elliot Park district of Keswick are also reported to be without power.A number of local roads are flooded (including the A6 in Kendal). The West Coast Main Line railway is also reported as subject to disruption due to flooding between Oxenholme and Carlisle. Some mainline services are terminatingat either Carlisle or Preston. Local services between Carlisle and Barrow are also reported to have delays.Some properties in Keswick, Cockermouth and Kendal had already been evacuated under pre-existing emergency plans.Robert Runcie, the Environment Agency's director of flood and coastal risk was quoted as saying: "After persistent heavy rain combined with saturated ground and full rivers across Cumbria, the decision was taken to evacuate residents in towns and villages across the Lake District, before the onset of serious flooding.""Since early on Thursday we have been helping emergency services coordinate community groups that are going house-to-house ensuring people were taking precautions and evacuated where necessary. These emergency plans were established following the Cumbria floods of 2005 and have worked successfully. The last thing we want is floodwater putting lives at risk.""We urge people to take care and check the latest flooding situation and sign up to our free flood warnings service or by calling 08459 881188."Earlier Cumbrian police had advised against non essential travel, and against fell-walking entirely.Chief Superintendent Kevin McGilloway  of Cumbria Constabulary stating  "All the agencies are working together with local people to ensure they are kept as safe as possible during the severe weather which is hitting some parts of the county. We are asking people not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary."  He also gave some advice, "Pedestrians in areas where there are floods, such as Cockermouth, Keswick, Penrith and Kendal, are being urged not to attempt to walk through flood waters. Anyone who notices blocked drains are also being urged not to put themselves at risk by attempting to unblock them. The key message is for people who are affected by the floods to be prepared, to try and protect any properties that are liable to flooding. Look out for one another including vulnerable friends and neighbours. Anyone in affected areas should ensure they carry mobile phones, torches, waterproofs and other equipment they may need and ensure they have all essential medication with them."In Kendal, demand for sandbags has been high. A spokesperson for South Lakeland council stated:"More than 1,000 sandbags have already been collected from our depot and we have ordered 4,000 more to meet the demand."The Mayor of Keswick praised efforts by those involved in the flood response. "It is all hands to the pump, really" he said.  "The emergency services are well co-ordinated and have been fantastic."Severe flooding in the southern United States left 28 people dead and caused extensive damage over the weekend. Two days of torrential rainfall, amounting to 13 inches (330 mm) in Nashville, Tennessee, swelled rivers and triggered rapidly rising waters.The states of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Mississippi were hit the hardest. The deluge caught many off-guard, forcing stranded residents to be rescued by boat. Parts of downtown Nashville were evacuated, and bus service there was suspended. Thousands of homeowners also lost electricity. The Cumberland River rose to extremely high levels, nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) above flood stage, and is not expected to return to normal levels until Wednesday morning.Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear issued a state of emergency in response to the floods. He said, "The safety of our citizens is my first priority. That is why I urge individuals who encounter high waters to use extreme caution and avoid unnecessary contact with flood waters if at all possible. Our thoughts are especially with those who lost loved ones in the tragic deaths that have been attributed to the weekend's storms." Forty-five counties in the state posted emergency declarations.In Tennessee, where the storms' death toll continues to rise, Governor Phil Bredesen requested federal assistance from President Barack Obama. After surveying the damage, Bredesen remarked, "We’re going to need a lot of help over these weeks ahead to get out of this."Total damages from what may be a 500- or 1,000-year flood event could be worth billions of dollars. Many prominent buildings were submerged in the Nashville area, where about 50 schools sustained damage. Meteorologists explain that the flooding came as a result of a slow-moving weather system that tapped into moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and pulled it northward into an unstable air mass. The storms' effects were even felt in Atlanta, Georgia, although to a lesser degree.A severe sandstorm has struck north-west China over the past few weeks, reaching Beijing on Saturday morning. The sandstorm, which covered homes, streets, and cars in dust, has left the sky a murky yellow. The air quality was rated as level five. Beijing's Weather Bureau issued a warning for the sandstorm, and advised citizens to stay in their homes until it passes. As much as 1500 micrograms per cubic meter of dust were reported to be airborne.Beijing has experienced unusually cold weather this year, with temperatures below freezing at night, even after the start of spring. The sandstorm is affecting more than 50 million people, and forecasters do not see signs of it stopping soon. The desertification of the western China and the Mongolian steppes has made the annual spring sandstorm become worse in the recent years, reaching countries such as South Korea and Japan. The sandstorm has turned the rain and snow yellow.The storm also impacted Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei for a total of 270 million people over an area of 1.8 million square kilometers.  It is expected the storm will last until Monday.Severe thunderstorms impacted the northeast United States today, producing sporadic power outages and weather conditions ranging from heavy rainfall to large hail. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) received dozens of damage reports; trees, tree limbs, electrical wires and utility poles were downed throughout portions of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. Severe weather advisories were posted during the morning and early afternoon, and are now expiring as the storms pull out of the area. According to the SPC, hailstones occasionally approached one inch in diameter. Strong winds were also present, and there were reports of dog kennels being blown across a highway in Pope County, Pennsylvania. However, no deaths or injuries occurred.The National Weather Service said a funnel cloud was reported in Livingston Manor, New York at about 1:55 pm this afternoon, prompting the brief issuance of a tornado warning.South-east China has been flooded by torrential rainstorms as the Severe Tropical Storm Bilis came ashore on Friday, July 14. The total death toll stands at 178 people but many people are missing, and the figure might rise.Floods, 10 meters high in some areas washed away 19,100 houses, damaged roads, power lines, and devastated villages and agriculture. Three million people were affected by the tropical storm which Xinhua, the state news agency, estimated would cost three billion yuan ($375 million) damage.The worse-hit provinces were Fujian, Hunan and Guangdong while their were deaths and an economic impact in Zhejian, Jiangxi and Guangxi provinces.At least 92 died in Hunan where dam reservoirs rose to their limits. The water swell in Leiyang rose 10 metres above the levels from Friday. 40,000 people in the cities of Hengyang and Chenzhou were reported stranded. 14 coal miners died when a dam burst, ravaging the land and flooding their pit at Shenjiawan Colliery.The floods in Hunan also took out the Beijing-Guangzhou railway leaving 5,000 stranded in the capital, Changsha. 10,000 workers were sent to repair the damaged sections of line.An estimated 33 people died in Guangdong, an important economic area near Hong Kong.  Lechang was submerged under three metres of water and 1663 prisoners had to be moved from the city.In Fujian province 43 people are reported dead. Deadly mudslides killed 10 in the city of Zhangzhou and another 10 are missing from a second mudslide.A 1.5m tidal surge is expected tonight in the United Kingdom and could lead to flooding on the Kent coast, according to the UK Met Office.  The surge is expected to cause "severe" flooding and the Thames Barrier was closed at 2000 UTC.  The Environment Agency have said that there is "extreme danger to life and property" and have evacuated 200 people on the coast.  1,300 properties are thought to be in the affected area.The Environment agency representative said that they would have extra staff available to inform the public of the risks but are also asking people to check that others are aware of the potential risks, especially to the elderly.The surge has been caused by the high wind speeds of over 80 miles per hour, and could be over hurricane force, high tides and low pressure over the North Sea. There are currently 42 flood warnings of various degrees, eight of which are rated severe.North Sea oil platforms are being evacuated in advance of the storm. BP is expecting to shut down the production on its North Sea oil platforms on Thursday. At the same time, Conoco Inc. has announced, that they will evacuate around 500 staff oil from platforms at the Ekofisk oil field. The METAR reports from Ekofisk Oil Platform are indicating continuously intensifying winds. At 11:50 UTC on Thursday, wind gusts of 57 knots were reportedAfter a week of heavy rain and snow, the Shakidor Dam near the coast of the southwestern Pakistan province of Baluchistan burst around 6:00 pm local time. So far, at least seventy people have died after five villages were swept away. Many bodies have been recovered by Coast Guard vessels sweeping the sea off the affected area with fishing nets.Provincial Minister Sher Jan Baloch announced troops have been called out for rescue operations. "The army has started rescue operations to try to save as many lives as possible." While over 1,000 have been rescued, possibly as many as 700 are missing - they may have been swept out to see, or may be seeking refuge on high ground or elsewhere. Alotogether, over 30,000 people have been affected.President Musharaf has announced a million dollars for the victims.The 148 m (485 ft) long Shakidor Dam near Pasni failed on Friday, sending thousands of people fleeing for safety. The dam, 800 km south of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan, was built two years ago. Although the specific details are not known, it is believed the dam was overwhelmed by past week's heavy rains which have caused flooding in the region.The flooding has cut off Pasni and other coastal regions, washing out roads and bridges. At least another 50 have died elsewhere as a result.The United Nations has reported that a total of 978 people have been killed by a cholera epidemic in the African nation of Zimbabwe, an increase of 25% from just three days ago. The UN also says that there have been 18,413 reported cases in the country since the epidemic began in August of 2008.The outbreak of the disease has been quickened by the lack of proper sanitation and the collapse of water systems and healthcare. The area worst affected by cholera is Zimbabwe's capital of Harare, where 208 people died out of 8,454 suspected cases. The town of Beitbridge, which is located on the border with South Africa, has also been hard hit, with 3,546 cases reported and 91 people dead.The South African Red Cross has sent medical aid to Zimbabwe, and has asked for funds to treat thirty thousand people. The UN says that as many as sixty thousand people could become affected by the disease if no action is taken.Last Thursday, Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe announced in a televised address that the outbreak had been halted, saying that "I am happy to say our doctors are being assisted by others, and the WHO [World Health Organization] have now arrested cholera."Mugabe has also accused Western powers of plotting to use the epidemic as a reason to overthrow him. "Now that there is no cholera, there is no cause for war," he stated. Other Zimbabwean high-ranking officials have also blamed the United Kingdom for spreading cholera on purpose.The UN Security Council will have a briefing on the Zimabwean cholera crisis soon.A Yorkshire pub affected by flooding in 2007 has been named CAMRA's National Pub of the Year for 2008.The Kelham Island Tavern in Sheffield's Kelham Island Quarter was in a "semi derelict" state when it was purchased in 2001. After it was re-opened in 2002 by licensee Trevor Wraith and manager Lewis Gonda, business quickly picked up and the pub has been awarded Sheffield CAMRA's local Pub of the Year award for the past four years. The pub won the award despite six weeks of closure a year and a half ago when the pub's cellar and floor were affected by the flooding of the River Don and the nearby Kelham goit. The pub also received Yorkshire CAMRA's Pub of the Year award in 2004 and 2007.CAMRA's Pub of the Year award is judged in several stages, with local CAMRA branches evaluating the pubs in their area and passing on recommendations for regional championships. The list of regional champions is then whittled down to four finalists, with CAMRA judges visiting each of these anonymously before making a final decision.The pub regularly serves ten and often up to thirteen Real Ales, and variety and quality of beers served are of particular interest to CAMRA, which was founded in 1971 in order to preserve and promote traditional British beer and pubs, which the group see as threatened.However, other considerations beyond range and variety of beers are also important. Julian Hough, CAMRA's Pubs Director, made particular note of the Tavern's "attention to detail". Mr Wraith also pointed out the pub's "sub-tropical" beer garden, which he calls his "pride and joy"; the pub was awarded Silver Gilts in the Yorkshire In Bloom competition every year since 2003 and has received the Gold Award in the local Sheffield In Bloom competition every year since 2005. The pub also regularly hosts evenings of folk music.Mr Gonda credited the pub's success to the "excellent brewers we deal with, our faithful and supportive pub regulars, and our invaluable staff members." It was this community support which helped the pub recover so quickly after the 2007 flooding, with Mr Wraith describing the day the waters entered the pub. "The funny thing was that it was difficult to get the customers to evacuate. They just wanted to keep on drinking, but we did have to get them out eventually and some of them did get wet." Flood defences were erected after the customers left, but to no avail; Mr Wraith stayed in the pub overnight, despite the flooding and the lack of electricity.The pub will be presented with the award in a ceremony later today at 1pm GMT.Oil producer Royal Dutch Shell has confirmed that the Gannet Alpha oil platform, located 112 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland, has suffered a leak from an underwater pipeline between the wellhead and platform.Shell issued a statement regarding the incident, saying that "We can confirm we are managing an oil leak in a flow line that serves the Gannet Alpha platform. [...] We have stemmed the leak significantly and we are taking further measures to isolate it. The subsea well has been shut in, and the flow line is being depressurised." The company has thus far refused to comment on the exact size of the leak, saying that was "not a significant spill."According to a Shell spokesperson, a remote submarine was deployed after a sheen was noticed in the water surrounding the platform; since then, a craft has been brought in to monitor water conditions in the area.The UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change has begun an investigation of the leak, with the Scottish government and Marine Scotland also involved in monitoring the situation.Cypriot cargo ship "Server" went down in Norwegian territory of the North Sea near the Norwegian city Bergen around 6pm local time on January 12. The ship broke into two parts and the accident is described as a catastrophe for the environment in the area due to a significant fuel oil leak. The oil reached land a short time after the breakdown.The entire 25-man crew was brought to land around 9pm by a Sea King-helicopter. At noon next day it was reported that 290 tons of heavy fuel oil had leaked out onto the sea. The spilt oil has covered ground along the coast and is reported to be still spreading. A nature reservation area for birds is in imminent danger of pollution.A blaze on the cargo vessel Aegean Sea has left three Greek and six Filipino sailors dead. Fire broke out in the Greek ship's engine room in the Caribbean Sea while it was 160km (100 miles) north of the Venezuelan mainland and close to Margarita Island.The Venezuelan Navy provided assistance after the fire broke out and five more of the twenty-four crew-members were airlifted to hospital. The nine who were killed were reported missing and later found dead in various compartments throughout the ship. The fire had spread upwards through much of the vessel, which had been carrying iron ore from Brazil to Texas.The injured were two men from the Philippines who received third-degree burns on their hands and faces while three Greeks had minor burns. All were taken to the mainland by the Venezuelan Maritime Rescue and Aid Service. The fire broke out before dawn yesterday when the ship was 33 nautical miles (61 km) from Blanquilla.The navy stated that the cause is unknown and the ship, which has all ten of its remaining crew still on board, will be towed to Margarita.A ship sank off the coast of Djibouti yesterday about 1 p.m. Eastern African Time (1000 UTC), killing 109 people. At least 20 more are reported missing. Reports say that 36 people are currently receiving medical care, and seven are in serious condition.The ship was bound for the religious festival of Djamaad, in the town of Tadjoura. Built to hold roughly 80 people, it was reported to have been carrying at least 200 people as well as construction materials at the time it sank. Though the cause of the accident has yet to be determined, Ismael Tani, advisor to the Djiboutian President Umar Guelleh, said that the overload probably caused the disaster. Eyewitness Omar Souleiki, however, blamed it on a small wave. Search operations by the Djiboutian, French, and American naval vessels have been called off for the night.The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) stated that over 200 Arab and African migrants are feared drowned after three boats, bound for Europe, sank in the Mediterranean in separate incidents.No less than 21 bodies were recovered on Tuesday when the boats capsized in heavy winds and rain near Libya's coast. 23 were rescued by workers on a oil rig close by."A boat with 257 migrants on board sank on Sunday off the coast of Libya. Twenty-three people were saved and 21 bodies were retrieved," said the IOM chief of mission in Libya's capital of Tripoli, Laurence Hart.Officials say that search and rescue efforts are ongoing, but that hopes of finding any more survivors are diminishing. "It is hard to imagine that there are survivors among the missing by now," Hart said.The people aboard the boats are suspected to have been smuggled across the sea to Italy. Libya's 1.770 kilometres of coastline is a popular point of departure for migrants hoping to escape poverty and find a better life in Europe."This is the beginning of the smuggling season in the Mediterranean. This tragic incident illustrates, once again, the dangers faced  by people caught in mixed irregular movements of migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean and elsewhere which every year cost thousands of lives," said UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Ron Redmond.There has been a history of people-smuggling into Italy from Libya: almost 37,000 immigrants considered to have entered illegally landed in Italy in 2008, the Italian interior ministry reports. The figures are a 75% increase from the previous year.Italian interior minister Roberto Maroni said that patrols on the sea would start on May 15 in an effort to curb the smuggling across the Mediterranean. "We have done everything possible to prevent arrivals. We have signed a deal with Libya and the Libyan government is committed to launch on May 15 patrols along the coasts with six vessels," he said. "Until then, we will continue to ask the Libyan authorities to intensify controls, but I guess that there will still be arrivals."A lone gunman dressed in black opened fire in a Finnish shopping mall in the city of Espoo, near the capital Helsinki. Four people have been confirmed dead following the incident, and others have been injured. Police have now stated that the gunman and his girlfriend have also been found dead; it is believed he committed suicide.According to the state broadcaster, YLE, three women and one man were among the dead. Several ambulances and police officers arrived at the mall.Kari Harjula, an eyewitness, told YLE, "I started to hear a lot of shouting from the outer doors of Citymarket and Sello, telling everybody to get out. The customers and employees were wondering what was going on. Soon some police ran in with riot shields and serious expressions on their faces. They yelled at everybody to get out; that the shopping centre was being evacuated. The situation was chaotic; there were a lot of police inside and outside. From a layman's point of view, it looked like a massive operation."Finland has one of the largest private firearms ownership and has seen several attacks in the recent past. In September 2008, a gunman killed nine students as well as a teacher before committing suicide, while in November 2007, another student killed eight, and ultimately shot himself dead.According to sources, four people have died in Lörrach, Germany, after an armed woman killed one in St Elisabethen Hospital before being shot dead by German police. Policemen say the shootings are related to an explosion that occurred in a nearby building, that killed a middle-aged man and a four-year-old child.Eugen Wissler, a Lörrach Police spokesman told Agence France-Presse that "firefighters were called out to an explosion followed by a fire in an apartment near the hospital."The shooting occurred at 18:00 local time (16:00 UTC) yesterday; according to Wissler, the woman killed a hospital staffer. The woman also injured a policeman, before the police shot her dead.Train services on two of Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit system lines, both operated by SMRT Corporation, were disrupted at separate times yesterday in two incidents.  During the morning rush hour, six stations of the Circle MRT Line (CCL) were without train service in both directions during the morning rush hour following what SMRT described as "intermittent signal interference". The company first announced the signalling fault on Twitter at 7:37 am, advising commuters to anticipate 10 additional minutes of travel time in the commute between Pasir Panjang and one-north stations. The fault was announced rectified two minutes later by another tweet from SMRT, though delays were still expected in the direction of Dhoby Ghaut station due to congestion at stations and on trains.SMRT issued another tweet at 8:09 am, alerting commuters to another signalling fault affecting the CCL, on the stretch between Botanic Gardens and HarbourFront stations.Initially informing commuters that the issue would add 10 minutes of travel time along the affected stretch, the company later revised this to 20, and finally, 30 minutes in subsequent tweets, attributing the delays to "intermittent signalling faults".The company later announced via Twitter service unavailable between Botanic Gardens and Marymount stations at 9:06 am, whilst offering free bus services along the length of the CCL. SMRT later amended the announcement in another tweet to encompass the stretch between Botanic Gardens and Serangoon stations. Train service was restored along the affected stretch by about 10:27 am.SMRT had previously experienced disruptions in service on the CCL for five consecutive days in September, also attributable to signalling issues, leading to authorities briefly switching off mobile signals at four CCL stations for two hours on September 2 during investigations. Most of the disruptions took place during peak hours, leading to suspicion the telecommunications network could be interfering with the train signalling system. After tests proved inconclusive following the lack of a disruption that day, the decision was made to turn off telecommunications signals in the event of another disruption.“It's very frustrating", commented a commuter, 41-year-old Joseph Lim.  "The trains are sometimes moving and sometimes getting stuck. I don't know whether to stay on board. The communication has been insufficient".Another commuter, 29-year-old Alice Pan, stated, "I am now stuck at the station with no way to get to work. I can't get on any SBS buses because they are full and there's no free shuttle bus in sight. I can't get any cabs either". Pan was stranded in a train for an hour at Lorong Chuan station.36-year-old Sean Chew, said of his experience during the incident, "I was stuck at Buona Vista for more than one hour. I didn't want to take the bus because it was very crowded. So no choice, had to wait [...] Luckily I just finished work."However, following the morning incidents, a stalled train on the East West MRT Line led to a half-hour disruption during the evening peak hour on the same day. SMRT informed commuters of the disruption, between Queenstown and Outram Park stations in the direction of Pasir Ris station, on Twitter at 5:48 pm, attributing it to a "train fault" at Tiong Bahru station. In the same tweet, SMRT estimated that the issue would be resolved around 6:10 pm. Due to the disruption, the company offered free bus services along the affected stretch in a subsequent tweet.At 6:20 pm, SMRT announced on Twitter that it had cleared the disruption by removing the stalled train, and that trains were "progressively return[ing] to normal speed". The company continued to offer free bus services until 7 pm, when it announced the termination of the service on Twitter. In the wake of yesterday's incidents, commuters criticized SMRT's handling of the matter on social media, citing SMRT's failure to provide sufficient information or sufficient buses for commuters, and uploading photos of the congestion.Thousands of Greeks gathered last night in Syntagma square in front of the parliament building in Athens to protest over the political response to the fires. An estimated 8,000 people attended, after a call for a silent protest had been distributed through e-mail, text messages and eventually the media. Although general elections are taking place in two and a half weeks time, the protest was meant to be apolitical. Some protesters taunted riot police, who responded with stun grenades.Limassol. At least two people have died at a Cypriot army aircraft crash in the village of Kolossi this morning, west of the island's southern coastal town of Limassol.Kolossi is a community of some 2,000 Britons, Germans and Cypriots.Director of the President's Press Office Marios Karoyan told CNA that the aircraft was a PC - 9 (Pilatus). It is one of the two training military aircraft of the National Guard (Cyprus Army) and according to the first reports two people have died, believed to be the two pilots.Defence Minister Kyriakos Mavronicolas and National Guard Commander Lieutenant-General Athanasios Nikolodemos have rushed to the area. Ambulances and fire engines are in the area.Officials in Buffalo, New York have closed a portion of a downtown street after a sinkhole was reported. At approximately 4:20 p.m. (Eastern time) Washington street between E. Eagle and Clinton was closed to vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Wikinews was on scene and obtained exclusive photos and statements.City officials say the sinkhole is located in an area under the road where a tunnel, about 40 feet wide, connects two buildings, formerly the AM&A's warehouse and department store which is now owned by The Bon-Ton. It was first reported last week when portions of the blacktop were seen caving in near the sidewalks. When city engineers examined the holes, they found it to span the entire width of the street and nearly a half the block's length with the hole being nearly 15 feet deep. Officials say the only thing holding up the road, is the thin layer of concrete and asphalt that make up the road's surface."I am shocked a car has not went through it (the street)", said a police officer who was coordinating the blocking effort.Despite today's actions, someone who wishes to remain anonymous tells Wikinews that the problems began nearly 10 years ago, and the city was notified then of the sinkhole.Officials state that the road will be closed for several months and all pedestrian and vehicle traffic will have to be diverted until further notice. It is not yet known when the repairs will begin. The person wishing to remain anonymous says the repairs could take years instead of months.A huge sinkhole in the earth swallowed about a dozen houses in a poor neighborhood of the capital of Guatemala. Three people died when the 330-ft-deep hole opened up on February 23. The police decided to evacuate some  1,000 people in the Guatemala City neighborhood.The bodies of Domingo Irma and David Soyos were recovered from the hole and surrounding sewage water.Officials speaking to the AP blamed recent rains and a ruptured sewage main for the massive hole.David Sharp, 34, who had reached the summit of Everest after two other unsuccessful attempts, ran out of oxygen on his way back.  Sharp was found 305 meters below the summit, in a cave.  He had apparently climbed alone.According to Inglis, he was the first of 40 people to pass David Sharp, and his party was the only one that offered help.  He radioed in to his base camp, but his expedition manager, "Russ," said, "Mate, you can't do anything. He's been there X number of hours without oxygen, he's effectively dead."  "The trouble is, at 8,500 metres it's extremely difficult to keep yourself alive, let alone keep anyone else alive," Inglis told Television New Zealand.Hillary faulted commercialisation of the mountain for the climber's death, saying that had a fellow climber been in distress he would have helped him even if it meant abandoning his own summit quest.  "I think the whole attitude towards climbing Mount Everest has become rather horrifying," The New Zealand Herald newspaper quoted him as saying. "The people just want to get to the top. They don't give a damn for anybody else who may be in distress."Hillary said that heading for the summit and letting people lie dying is not pleasant and he hopes it is not repeated.Sharp's parents, for their part, said that they do not blame Inglis, or anyone else for their son's death; the other climbers had to look after themselves.Two weeks after a disastrous earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, the situation at the severely damaged Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant has been described by the Prime Minister as "very grave and serious". In a nationally televised report to the nation on Friday, Naoto Kan said the Japanese government was "not in a position where we can be optimistic."Radiation is reported to still be leaking from the plant, in Fukushima prefecture. "The source of the radiation seems to be the reactor core," said Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official Hidehiko Nishiyama, adding that radiation was "more likely" coming from the core than from the reactor's spent fuel pool.  On Thursday three workers stepped into contaminated cooling water in the reactor's turbine room  while trying  to replace cables at  reactor No. 3, Nishiyama said. The water seeped into the the boots of two of the workers, touching their skin and causing lesions; the third worker's clothing  protected him from the water. The two workers with skin lesions were hospitalized for radiation exposure. The radiation level of the contaminated water measured 10,000 times the level of cooling water in an undamaged reactor.File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe 2.jpgWork has been stopped on attempts to reattach a permanent power line to the cooling system in reactor No. 3, and the building has been evacuated. Nishiyama could give no predictions of when work would resume. The possibility that water is leaking from the core of reactor No. 3 increases the danger for workers who attempt to cool the crippled plant. The reactors must be cooled before more safety work can begin. Japan had been using seawater for cooling  since the disaster crippled the power plant's cooling systems, but U.S. officials were concerned that  saltwater could harm the  equipment, causing it to seize up and corrode, thereby worsening the situation.News reports on Monday indicated authorities in Palestine, Texas identified a sixth victim following flash flooding late last week. Giovani Olivas, 30, was reportedly swept away in the flood.In under an hour late Friday evening, Palestine was deluged by seven inches of rain, causing residents of one neighborhood to flee to their rooftops. Over 30 buildings, included many homes, in the city suffered significant damage. Lenda Asberry, 64, a retired school teacher, and her four great grandchildren also drowned during the flood. Onlookers reported the woman was attempting to get the children to safety when they were swept away. Asberry's daughter told reporters water levels were up to the woman's neck while attempting to save the children.One resident of the area told reporters "[her] furniture was floating around" inside her home, forcing her to climb atop her couch to seek safety. Dark skies blanketed the nearby city of Tyler hours before the storm struck. At least one government office located in the Palestine area was closed on Monday and was slated to remain closed on Tuesday due to water damage. A tornado also ravaged much of nearby Lindale, Texas, resulting in severe damage of at least one residence. The storm system moved up along the US eastern seaboard over the weekend.Six people have been killed after a bus carrying Polish tourists crashed in Serbia. The accident happened yesterday on a road north of Belgrade that led to Novi Sad. The nearest town is Indjija. The bus had been taking the tourists home after a trip to Bulgaria.Five victims died at the scene. They were a woman, three men and a child. Another child died later in hospital. Of a total of sixty-eight on the bus, around forty are injured, although exact figures are unclear. All the victims are passengers, as the owner of the vehicle's operator Moana, Josef Rzepka, said both of the drivers on board escaped unhurt.A Reuters photograph shows the bus lying on its right side next to what appears to be a straight stretch of road. There is a slight slope under the bus and its rear end appears to have reached the bottom of the drop, crushing the roof at the back of the bus. It is not yet clear what caused the bus to swerve off the road, but as the crash occurred at 6:30 a.m. local time the driver may have fallen asleep at the wheel.There are also allegations that the double-decker bus may have been in a poor state of repair. The father of one victim said that the vehicle's windscreen wipers were taped together and the paintwork had been done by a brush instead of sprayed on. He also said that his daughter had reported rain leaking through the bus roof. Polish media also says some parents were concerned by the bus before they sent their children on the journey, although others say the bus appeared mechanically safe. Regardless, the bus has been removed with a crane and subjected to a technical examination by police.Poland supplied a military aircraft to transport relatives into Serbia. The crash is the worst in the area since a disaster in April 2004 that saw a Bulgarian coach returning from a journey to Croatia crashed into the Lim river, leaving twelve students dead. Road accidents are common in Serbia as regulations are commonly ignored. New legislation has been proposed to fine violators more heavily, but has yet to be implemented.An investigation is ongoing.A Piper PA-31 Navajo Chieftain owned and operated by Servant Air has crashed shortly after takeoff from Kodiak Island, Alaska, United States. Six people were killed and four others were rescued.The flight was a 100 mile scheduled domestic charter flight from Kodiak to Homer. Servant Air are a small local airline that serves Kodiak, which has a population of around 6,000. The airline was founded in 2003 and currently operates seven planes. The plane took off at 1:48 p.m. local time Saturday and subsequently crashed in a shallow harbor 50 yards from the runway.Dean Andrew, who was piloting a float plane taxiing on the water nearby, was able to rescue four people from the crashed plane. "Once I got them in they were really cold, and they were just pretty hysterical because they had told me that their family's in that plane," said Andrew, who the International Tribune Herald reports operates his own small air service, although the Seattle Times reported that he flew the plane for Trident Seafoods.Alaska State Troopers and Kodiak Police divers were called in to retrieve the bodies of four others. A fifth was pulled out the water after attempting to swim 300 yards to shore, but he had already succumbed to the cold.The passengers were Russian Orthodox Old Believers who had chartered the flight home in order to celebrate Russian Christmas, which is celebrated on Monday. The deceased have been identified as Homer citizens Stefan F. Basargin, 36; Pavel F. Basargin, 30; Zahary F. Martushev, 25; Iosif F. Martushev, 15; Andrian Reutov, 22 and local pilot Robin Starrett, 50. The survivors, who have not been identified, are all in good condition or out of hospital. Two were flown to Anchorage for treatment and two remained in Kodak; in both cases one was released and one remains.Andrew described the moments leading up to the crash: "I heard Servant Air's Navajo taking off, and shortly after he took off, he said, 'I need to return to the airport.' I know the pilot, and I could tell by the tone of his voice that it was probably something serious."The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened a full investigation. NTSB investigator Clint Johnson told reporters it's possible that mechanical problems with the plane caused the accident.Ted Panamarioff, spokesman for Servant Air, said of Starrett "Very humble, very caring. Very detail oriented. Very precise in the way he did things. He was an excellent family man. Excellent co-worker." He also said that Starrett had served in the Coast Guard, and that those involved were regular customers well known with the small airline. "We're all family and friends here. We knew these customers for several years. This is really, really tragic."An AS532 Cougar helicopter has crashed in the south-east of France, killing all six occupants onboard. The aircraft, owned by manufacturing company Eurocopter, descended in the Verdon Gorge — located in the department of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence — at roughly 13:30 CEST (1130 UTC) yesterday. Police lieutenant Benoit Gounine told Reuters "[t]he accident occurred in a place that's very difficult to access, which is complicating our work".A spokesperson for Eurocopter said the occupants of the helicopter were company engineers and test pilots. The aircraft, which launched from a heliport near Marseille, was being taken on a test flight and was due to be delivered to a customer later. Gilles Bruniaux, security development director at Eurocopter, said the helicopter occupants were "hardened professionals".Although investigations into the cause of the incident are ongoing, initial examinations by police and witness reports suggest the helicopter impacted with an electricity cable before descending. The owner of a restaurant close to the impact site told Agence France-Presse "customers having lunch on the terrace started yelling — there was an explosion and lots of black smoke".Verdon Gorge, one of the most famous in Europe, has a depth of 700 metres (2300 feet). The gorge is notable for its popularity with hikers.In the United States, six men linked to the defunct Florida company Platinum Jet Management have been charged in connection to the February 2, 2005 crash of a jet owned by the company at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport. The Bombardier Challenger CL-600's crash left twenty people hospitalised and prosecutors allege that regular breaches of federal law were to blame.The business jet had been privately chartered for a flight to Chicago Midway Airport but failed to take off. Instead, the aircraft broke through a fence, crossed Route 46 and struck a warehouse, causing a fire. The plane clipped two cars on the way across the road and the accident left eleven people onboard the aircraft and nine more on the ground hospitalised.The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the accident and found that the flight crew had miscalcualted the aircraft's centre of gravity and that overfilling the fuel tanks had moved it too far forward. According to a federal indictment filed Wednesday, six men within the company were "routinely undertaking and concealing dangerous fueling and weight-distribution practices." Three co-founders of Platinum -  Michael Brassington, 35, his brother Paul Brassington, 29, and Andre Budhan, 42, as well as maintenance director Brien McKenzie, also 42, have been arrested and pilot Francis Vieira, 59, and director of charters Joseph Singh, 37, are being sought.The 23-count indictment says that Michael Brassington, McKenzie and Vieira regularly stated in paperwork that aircraft were operating at weights up to 1,000 pounds lighter than the true value in breach of Federal Aviation Administration laws. It also accuses Platinum of operating commercial charters for a year between November 2002 and November 2003 without a valid licence and filing such flights as noncommercial. The document goes on to accuse Platinum of using pilots that lacked proper training; in particular John Kimberling, who flew the jet that crashed, was not adequatly qualified to fly commercial flights, which have stricter regulations than noncommercial air operations. He has not been charged himself at this time, but investigations continue. The Southern Ledger states the accused face charges of "conspiracy, fraud, endangering the safety of aircraft and making false statements to the National Transportation Safety Board."A bridge collapsed in the southern city of Karachi, Pakistan. At least four people are dead and there are several crushed vehicles under the mounds of debris, say officials. The cause of the accident is not immediately clear.Iraqi police report a bomb explosion killed five civilians and one security official, and injured at least another twelve, Wednesday at 9:15 a.m.  The bomb was planted near a state-operated bank in a Shi'ite slum.The blast occurred while retirees waited in line to receive their pension checks.Three anonymous civilians told Associated Press, the blast killed three men and two women.According to Naval officer Admiral Mike Mullen, violence in Iraq is at its lowest since 2003, however, Baghdad remains an area where low-level violence still occurs.A car crash on the A614 road, in Nottinghamshire, England has killed six people, all of whom are believed to have lived near the scene of the crash.All six victims died at the scene of the crash, which involved four young adults in a Peugeot 206 and two elderly people, possibly a male and female, who police believe to be in their 60s, in the other car said to be a Ford Fiesta. Rescue workers fought to save the one of the elderly individuals, but were unsuccessful. Both vehicles collided head-on and exploded upon colliding.Two police officers on traffic patrol discovered the crash, which took place at 23:00 local time (UTC) yesterday. The officers involved were praised by Bruce Cameron, a superintendent for Nottinghamshire Police. "The bodies are very badly burnt and they will have to be identified using dental records. We want to make sure we are absolutely certain as to who was in both cars when the accident happened," he said. Local residents say that the A614 has been the scene of a large number of accidents. One resident, Stuart Stonebridge, told The Daily Telegraph that "we only moved here three years ago and there have been a lot of accidents and some fatalities in that time," while another resident, Janice Gilbody said that "the people of Bilsthorpe will be in shock, horror and disbelief at the young lives lost."Gilbody also said that this accident is "yet again another accident on this road." She then added that the road was dangerous, saying that "it’s a wonder it doesn’t happen more often."The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but police say weather was not a contributing factor.At least six miners are trapped approximately 1700 feet underground in a coal mine in Utah after portions of the shaft collapsed. The mine is owned by Utah American Energy and is close to the town of Huntington, Emery County, 160 km south of Salt Lake City.Robert Murray, The CEO, President, Director and owner of Murray Energy and the owner of Utah American Energy, said during a press conference at 5:00 p.m. (eastern time), an "earthquake caused the collapse at about 3:00 a.m. (mountain time)." The United States Geological Survey (USGS) recorded what is allegedly a magnitude 3.9 earthquake at 2:48 a.m. (mountain time) on Monday morning 21 km (13 miles) east, southeast of Mount Pleasant, Utah, but the director of the USGS seismology stations Walter Arabasz, says that no earthquake caused the collapse.Murray states that at least "two mining machines will be brought in to clean out the debris" at the beginning of the collapse and that he will "spare no expense" in rescuing the men."We have four rescue teams working to free the trapped miners. We will try four ways to get to the miners which include drilling 1,700 feet from the top of the mountain. We will also drill a hole" in a neighboring mine shaft sealed in 2004 after it was finished being mined that is "about 100 feet from the miners."Multiple people are reported dead after an early Friday bus crash near Phoenix, Arizona. The Arizona Department of Public Safety stated that there were "multiple fatalities and serious injuries" in the incident.The collision occurred south of Phoenix, near milepost 173 on Interstate 10. Public Safety barred westbound traffic lanes and could not specify any time when these lanes would open. Six people have died while seven more are in critical condition. 10 others received less severe injuresLocal ABC broadcaster, KNXV-TV, said the crash occurred 5:27 AM local time (UTC 12:27). Apart from the buses, it involved two trucks and multiple cars. The buses, which lie at one side of the road, are covered by debris, according to witnesses. The ladders of the rescue workers leaned against its side. The bus was badly damaged with most of its windows broken.An emergency site was constructed to treat the casualties. The injured were gathered on a tarp in the road before being transported by ambulances and helicopters.Six teenagers were killed in a horrific road accident near Mildura in north-western Victoria, Australia late at night on February 18. Cassandra Manners, aged 16, Stevie-Lee Weight, 15, Cory Dowling, 16, Shane Hirst, 16, and his sister, Abby Hirst, 17, died at the scene. Josephine Calvi, 16, was flown to the Royal Adelaide Hospital, where she later died of head injuries. Seven other teenagers were injured, including 15-year-old Marco Medici who is now in a stable but critical condition in The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne.The accident occurred after the teenagers left a 16th birthday party and walked along Myall Road, Cardross, south-east of Mildura. A car allegedly came speeding around a bend, hit the gravel on the side of the road, lost control and struck the group. The alleged driver, later identified as 34-year-old Thomas Graham Towle, fled the scene on foot, leaving his 10-year-old daughter and four-year-old son in the car. Towle was later arrested by police in Redcliffs. He was taken to Mildura police station for questioning.Towle has been charged with six charges of culpable driving causing death, four charges of negligently causing serious injury, one charge of failing to stop and one charge of failing to render assistance after an accident. Towle faced Mildura Magistrates' Court on February 20. Magistrate John Dugdale remanded him into custody to reappear before the court on June 26.Meanwhile, the town of Mildura and surrounding areas is in deep mourning. Premier Steve Bracks said the State Government will provide $AU40,000 for counselling and support services.Around 3,000 people attended the funeral for Josephine Calvi today.

No serious injuries arose as a result of the accident, however traffic was reduced to a single lane.  Traffic control was conducted by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer who was at the scene at the time of the accident (7:45 a.m.).  The RCMP cruiser was not one of the vehicles involved in the pile up.  The crash was put under investigation by a traffic analyst.The John Hart Highway connects Prince George,a city of 70,981 according to the 2006 census, with Dawson Creek over a length of approximately 250 miles (400 km).  The Northwest Corridor Association saw a C$30 million twinning upgrade to the John Hart bridge which spans the Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River.  The bridge is located 5.4 kilometres (3.4 miles) north of Prince George.  In March there is a traffic volume of between 11,000 to 12,000 vehicles per day at the north end of the John Hart bridge according to the the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation Average Annual Daily Traffic AADT reports between 1994 and 2000.Following a series of explosions in Gaza, killing five Palestinians including a six year old girl, the ruling party Hamas arrested 200 Palestinians, citing it as "only the beginning". Many of the arrested are affiliated with the Islamist movement's Fatah rivals who denies responsibility for the events. The detainees were transferred to a prison previously used by the Palestinian Authority and colloquially known as the "Guantanamo of Gaza", after the controversial United States detention center.On Friday, a bomb exploded at a junction in the strip, killing five Hamas operatives along with a six year old girl. Another 15 bystanders were wounded. Hamas movement's armed wing, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades told reporters that it was unknown who attacked the car on Gaza coastal road, adding that all of the passengers, including five Hamas militants, were killed. While the exact circumstances are still unclear, it is believed that the explosion was not a result of an unexpected eruption of explosives carried by the group. Hamas would not blame the rival Fatah faction directly for the incident but implied its involvement, issuing a statement blaming "members of the fugitive party".A third of its kind attack in a single day, it was an upgrade in the internal violence flare-ups. Earlier on Friday morning, a Palestinian was killed during an attack on a Gaza City coffee shop while a house of a Hamas parliament member had another bomb hurled at it.The Gaza Strip has been under the control of the Islamist Hamas movement since June 2007, when it seized full control from Fatah, routing the security forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in a week of deadly infighting.A six-year-old boy from the county of Berkshire in England, United Kingdom, who fell through a frozen pond on January 5, has died.  The pond is near to the location of his house where he was playing with one of his friends.  Thomas Hudson — or Tommy as he was also known — was trapped underneath the garden pond in Crookham Common, which was six feet in depth, for 30 minutes.  It is not clear what exactly caused Thomas to fall into the pond.After calls for help from Tommy's playmate, a woman went into the water and searched for Thomas.  It is believed that the woman was related to Tommy.  A fire crew managed to take Thomas out of the water.  After ambulance workers found themselves unable to restart his heart, Tommy was taken by aircraft to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, Oxfordshire.  There, an emergency operation was carried out on him before Thomas was placed on a life support machine.  He died on January 21 after he failed to regain consciousness.It has been reported that Thames Valley Police are launching an investigation into the death. However, the police has said that there are no suspicious circumstances as far as they are concerned.Hugh Whitaker was one of the people assisting in the search for Thomas on January 5.  "We worked as a team with the fire service to locate the boy in the water and he was pulled out," Whitaker stated.  "It was thought he had been in there for around half an hour.  Once he was located he was taken to the air ambulance and on to the John Radcliffe Hospital after being treated by a doctor.  He was in cardiac arrest at the scene.  A woman who went into the water was examined by paramedics at the scene but she did not require hospital treatment.  The lake was between 15 and 20 metres by 15 and 20 metres in size.  From where he was recovered from he would have had to have walked out onto the water — he was not far from the centre of the frozen lake."A statement released from the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust that said: "We are very sorry to confirm that Tommy Hudson died peacefully at our hospital this [Thursday] morning. Tommy's parents ask that their privacy be respected at this very difficult time."Six-year-old Thomas David Horne from the United Kingdom has died and eleven other British tourists were injured Friday when their plane crashed in Canaima National Park in Venezuela. They were on a sight seeing tour of the world's tallest waterfalls, the Angel Falls.The single engine, nine-seater Cessna 208 Caravan, lifted off shortly before the end of the runway, lost power, and then surged briefly before plummeting into the Venezuelan jungle in front of the 3,200 ft falls."It started to take off and we sensed it was losing power. Then it seemed to get it back and lifted off just 200 metres before the end of the runway. Then it dived into the trees," reported Makeli Freire, a park tour guide.Three of the injured sustained serious injuries, while the others suffered mainly broken bones. Thomas Horne, who sustained serious head injuries, died on the way to a local hospital. The pilot, co-pilot and tour guide were among the injured. Everyone on board was flown to Ciudad Bolívar, the capital city of Venezuela's Bolívar state, where they were treated for their injuries. Among the injured were Thomas's mother and father Jane and David who were among those who had broken bones. They were British tourists finishing up a two week holiday to Venezuela."The young boy died as he was being flown to hospital. His parents are both physically OK but are completely distraught over the loss of their son," said Maiker Puga, of the Ciudad Bolivar clinic.Liz and her husband Keith Grainger and S. Phillips, also British tourists, were also injured in the crash. The names of the three other British tourists and the three person crew who were injured have not been released at this time.The plane tour was offered by First Choice, a division of TUI Travel PLC who extended their "heartfelt sympathy to family and friends during this deeply sad time."  LTA airline has suspended further flights until the investigation is concluded.June Holman, Thomas's aunt who was not on holidays said, that "there is nothing worse than losing a loved one, especially not a young child with their whole life ahead of them. The thoughts of us all are with his parents Jane and Dave at this very sad time."A suicide bomber blew himself up in a central Afghanistan market earlier today, killing at least sixteen civilians and a policeman, and wounding more than a dozen, according to reports. Nobody has, at least yet, claimed responsibility for the blast.Police said the attack occurred in the town of Dihrawud, in the Uruzgan province.  The area was crowded as shoppers and vendors gathered for a bazaar. Three of those killed in the blast were reportedly children."The terrorists today carried out a suicide attack in the bazaar of Dihrawud district of Uruzgan province as a result of which 16 civilians were killed and 13 others were wounded," said Uruzgan police chief Juma Gul Himat."The bomber had explosives attached to a waistcoat. He was spotted by a guard of the money market which is inside the bazaar and then he blew himself up," said General Abdul Hameed, a spokesman for NATO-led troops in Afghanistan.The attack comes a day after the United Nations said the number of civilians killed in war-related violence in Afghanistan reached its highest level last year since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001. In that report, the chief human rights officer at the UN mission in Kabul, Norah Niland, said 2,412 Afghan civilians were killed in 2009, two-thirds of them by anti-government rebels.Two powerful suicide attacks struck different areas of northwestern Pakistan on Saturday, apparently targeting the country's security forces. In the first attack, a bomber killed at least six people and wounded more than 60 others outside a police station in Bannu.Shortly thereafter, in Peshawar's commercial district, another attacker blew himself up outside a bank affiliated with the Pakistani army, killing ten people and wounding more than 70 others.  Authorities in Bannu said the suicide bomber exploded a small truck full of explosives, destroying the police station and surrounding buildings.District Police Officer Iqbal Marwat said nearby civilians were wounded, but most of the casualties were police officers. He said the attacker tried to ram the vehicle through the main gate, but then detonated the bomb after police opened fire.Local media are quoted a representative for the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan as taking responsibility for the bombing.In a telephone call, Taliban spokesman Qari Hussain Mehsud warned civilians to keep away from security checkpoints and other police installations, saying that "we have broken the silence as the government did not understand the pause in attacks, and from now there will be an increase in the number of suicide bombings."This is the first time the alliance of more than a dozen militant groups with links to al-Qaida has claimed responsibility since its former leader Baitullah Mehsud was reportedly killed in a U.S. missile strike.  Analysts had suggested the group was in disarray following Mehsud's death.Hours later in Peshawar, officials say an attacker in a parked car threw a grenade at a crowd of people outside the Askari Bank before detonating a bomb in his car."Ten people have been killed and 71 wounded, five of them critically," said the chief government administrator of Peshawar, Sahibzada Anis, to the Reuters news agency."It was terrible. My children are very frightened. All the windows of my house are broken. It was very frightening," said Beenish Asad, a witness to the event, who lives near where the explosion took place.No one has claimed responsibility for that particular attack. Senior police official Ghafoor Afridi told Voice of America that the bomber had managed to bypass multiple security checkpoints. "There was checking all around. But somehow, it is not possible to check all vehicles, so they might have slipped a vehicle inside and exploded it," said Afridi. North West Frontier Province's information minister, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that the recent violence would not discourage government forces from fighting the rebels. "It is not only our duty [...] to fight this menace of terrorism, it is a responsibility of the whole world. We are on the front line today, that's why our blood is being shed."Hussain also said "we are not scared of these people and we have to extend our operations wherever these terrorists are operating," adding that forty suspected would-be suicide bombers had been apprehended within the past several months.The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan released a statement in which it condemned the bombings. "[The attacks] highlight the vicious and inhuman nature of this enemy whose true target is the democratically elected government of Pakistan and the security of all Pakistanis," the embassy said.Saturday's attacks come as the Pakistani military works to expand its offensive against the Taliban from in and around Swat Valley to the north to South Waziristan.A search-and-rescue mission was underway after a helicopter with 16 people on board crashed off the northeastern coast of Scotland in the North Sea on Wednesday, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency stated.Police say they have recovered eight bodies, while the other eight persons aboard are still unaccounted for. The chopper was returning from an oil platform shortly before 2:00 p.m. local time when it crashed into the waters about 35 miles (56 km) from the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland.The aircraft involved in the accident is believed to be a Eurocopter AF332 L2 Super Puma."A supply vessel called Normand Aurora, which was quite close by, has put their fast response boat into the water and is looking for survivors," said a spokesman for the agency. "Two helicopters from the RAF have been scrambled to the scene and a Nimrod marine patrol aircraft has been diverted to the area. Aberdeen coastguard have begun broadcasting a mayday signal into the area and RNLI lifeboats from Peterhead and Fraserburgh are heading for the scene now."This February, another helicopter went down in fog in the North Sea. All eighteen people on board survived. In March, a Sikorsky S-92A helicopter carrying oil workers also crashed off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, killing seventeen people.A Florida cinematographer, skydiving with 14 others, was killed on Saturday when his legs were severed at the knees by the wing of the aircraft that had just dropped him.Albert Wing III deployed his parachute and caught an updraft when the left wing of a DHC-6 Twin Otter propeller plane struck him. He managed to control his descent and land near the DeLand Airport, about 40 miles north of Orlando.He was airlifted to a hospital where he later died. It was not known if he was filming at the time of the accident, and a camera has not been found.The plane and the other sport jumpers landed safely.A collision between a tourist coach and a train at a level-crossing near Brezno, central Slovakia, has left at least 12 people dead and 20 injured. The accident happened at about 09:00 local time (08:00 UTC) on Saturday morning, when a coach from the western Slovakian town of Bánovce nad Bebravou carrying 36 people to the ski resort of Polomka Bucnik, was struck by a train traveling at full speed at a crossing.The train, only two cars long, was reported to have derailed, but passengers on it suffered only minor injuries. BBC News reports that there were no rail barriers to stop vehicles, only lights at the crossing."All the dead and injured were on the bus. There were only a few passengers on the train and they didn't suffer any serious injuries," said Slovak Railways spokesperson Martina Pavlikova.Two of the most seriously injured casualties, with spinal injuries, were airlifted by helicopter to a hospital in Banská Bystrica, while others were treated locally in Brezno. At least six people remain in serious or critical condition.Tatra Mountains —A Slovakian man who was trapped in his car under an avalanche, has escaped by urinating on ice to melt it. The man—who had 60 half-litre bottles of beer with him in the car—literally drank his way to safety."I was scooping the snow from above me and packing it down below the window, and then I peed on it to melt it," he said.Rescue workers found the man still drunk on a mountain path in Slovakia’s Tatra Mountains four days after his Audi car was buried. "It was hard and now my kidneys and liver hurt. But I'm glad the beer I took on holiday turned out to be useful and I managed to get out of there," he said. He first planned to shovel the ice from outside his window, directly into his car, but soon realised that he would run out of room in his car before he would be able to reach the top.Snowfalls of levels not seen since 1941 have fallen over parts of Europe over the past week. Some places have registered more than 3 meters of snow in 24 hours.42 of 43 Slovak soldiers were killed as an An-24 type aircraft of the Slovak Army crashed shortly after 8.30 pm UTC+1 at a hill in the North East of Hungary. There were 43 soldiers (including three women) on the board. The plane was flying from Pristina to Košice, Slovakia as it collided 10 km away from the border to the 800 meter high hill.Two aircraft entered the Hungarin airspace, the captain of the second alarmed the authorities. One survivor has been found, there is no news of other surviving.Early Wednesday morning (5:30 am local time), the Pakistani military helicopter Lama III rescued Slovenian alpinist Tomaž Humar, who went up on a solo climb on one of the highest peaks in the Himalayas.Humar became trapped by a bad weather and avalanches in a ice-cave on 5 August at an approximate height of 5900 meters with no food left for the last few days. After Mr. Humar was back in the base-camp, the mission medic Dr. Anda Perdan said he has some very beginning of chilblains on his toes, but she expects there will be no serious consequences. By one of the Slovenian news-sites 24ur.com - Srečen, na trdnih tleh, he decided to stay in the base-camp after the rescue mission (and not being taken to the hospital), however, by the Reuters news agency, he has been later taken to a hospital located in the mountain town of Gilgit.This article is a continuing story of the Slovenian alpinist in rescue on Nanga Parbat.Jure Robič, the Slovenian cyclist who won the Race Across America five times, has died in a traffic collision at the age of 45. Robič died after colliding with a 55-year-old driver whilst riding down hill in Jesenice. He was on a training ride in preparation for the Australia's Crocodile Trophy mountain bike race. An investigation into the accident is underway.Robič was a five-time winner of the Race Across America men's solo, with his first victory in 2004. He dropped out of the 2009 race whilst in second place due to a time penalty he felt he unfairly received. His last victory in the race was earlier this year. Robič's five wins is a record in men's solo races.Before competing in ultra-marathons, Robič was a member of the Slovenian national cycling team from 1988 to 1994. He twice set the world record for the 24-hour road race and won the Race across Slovenia three times. During his career he had over 100 victories and 150 podium finishes.A small aircraft struck an apartment building in New York this afternoon, killing the pilot and a flight instructor.  Cory Lidle, a pitcher for the New York Yankees baseball team, was the registered owner of the aircraft and is believed to have been piloting it; his passport was found on the scene.  The flight instructor was Tyler Stanger.The plane, a Cirrus SR20 with registration number N929CD, hit the 26th floor of the Belaire Condominium, a 50 story brick luxury residential building on the Upper East Side at 524 East 72nd Street at York Avenue near the East River in Manhattan, New York City, of which the first 20 floors are a hospital. An eyewitness, present half a block from the building, reported that the plane hit the building, creating an enormous fireball, broke in two and crashed down onto on the street below. Authorities received a 911 call reporting a crash at 2:42 p.m. Eastern time.New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg gave a press conference at approximately 5:20 p.m. Eastern time to report that the plane was occupied by a flight instructor and a student pilot, but as next-of-kin had not been able to be notified, the identities of the two people on the plane would not be released at this time. Apartments were seen to be engulfed in flames.  The FBI has stated that it was not an intentional attack. The New York area was grey and overcast during the time at crash; however, visibility was not hampered.After an hour and a half, the fire was extinguished by the FDNY. According to CNN Television ten people have been injured, six of them firefighters. The New York Times, however, reports that eleven firefighters have been injured.Initial reports suggested that a helicopter was involved, but the FAA has stated that it was a fixed-wing aircraft.  CNN Television reported that it was a single-engine fixed-wing plane which left Teterboro Airport, a busy General Aviation airport in New Jersey, circled the Statue of Liberty was tracked on radar until it was lost near the 59th Street Bridge, that the plane may have been having fuel problems or fuel pump problems, and that it was "a pilot in distress."  Wallace Sines, a source for CNN stated he believes the plane was a Cirrus SR-20 with an installed parachute, which did not deploy. The whole-plane parachute system may have saved the lives of the aircraft occupants had it been safely deployed clear of buildings, but the system is not designed to prevent the trauma associated with a plane impacting a builing. The Cirrus SR-20 was introduced in 2001 and the Cirrus line of 4-seater aircraft has since become one of the most purchased single engine aircraft in the world. The SR-20 does not normally carry an airline-style flight-data recorder, but some are equipped with GPS equipment which logs flight direction, speed and altitude.The aircraft was owned by baseball player Cory Lidle.  He was on board reported by AP. Lidle was killed, according to reports.  CNN Television reported that the FBI stated he was at the controls as the only occupant of the plane, and that his passport was found on the ground below the accident.An aiplane from the Patrulla Aerea (Air Patrol) crashed in Mosquera, Nariño, a small and remote town in the south west part of Colombia. Immediately after takeoff, the plane, a Cessna, was pushed by heavy crosswind, and crashed into a house, killing a boy, his mother and a doctor on board. The pilot, Rafael Arenas, aged 42, who had been working for 10 years on the Air Patrol, survived with burns on 90% of his body, but died later in the Intensive Care unit of El Valle Universitary hospital.The Air Patrol is a Colombian ONG, created and staffed by pilots and doctors to bring medical care to people in the most abandoned regions of the country.According to the United States Geological Survey a magnitude 5.5 earthquake hit the Solomon Islands at approximately 09:12:20 (UTC).The epicenter was located 40 km [25 miles] south east of Gizo, New Georgia Islands in the Solomon Isle.It is not known if there is any damage associated with the tremor, but shake maps from the USGS say that "light to moderate" damage could be reported.On April 4, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck the same area.

The wildfire in Arizona continued to burn Tuesday night when weather conditions settled down, although conditions will likely become worse Wednesday. Covering 365 square miles, the fire has created hazy conditions as far away as Iowa. Residents of small communities including Greer and Alpine have been warned to evacuate. The Wallow Fire is currently the nation's largest wildfire; another fire is burning in southern Arizona. So far, about 3,000 people have evacuated the area around the Wallow Fire.Around 2,500 firefighters are working to combat the wildfire; around four buildings have burned so far while hundreds more are at risk. On Monday, Arizona governor Jan Brewer signed a state of emergency declaration allowing access to special funds. High winds up to 60 MPH have been reported, allowing the fire to continue to move north. Joe Reinarz, the firefighting operation's commander, said, "The bad news is it's supposed to pick back up all the way through Thursday." U.S. Highway 180 was closed by officials for around two miles because of thick smoke obscuring drivers' visibility. The wildfire is decimating the ponderosa pine forest in the area; Kelly Wood, a Pinetop Fire Department spokesperson, said, "Normally, you can see the forest for miles. Now, there’s just smoke."The large amounts of smoke have started to take a toll on area residents. Director of the local White Mountain Regional Medical Center Jerry Campeau said, "It’s very irritating. The first symptom is sinus pain. Then the throat gets irritated, sometimes so badly you can cough up blood. When you start to have tightness in the chest, then it’s serious." Patients have been taken away by road, as the smoke prevented any air transportation. The blaze began May 29 in the Bear Wallow area and has become the second largest in Arizona's history. National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin said a large area of high pressure was causing smoke to be blown eastward. He said, "These fires have been going pretty good for the last four to six days, and with the dry conditions, they’re burning hot right now."A massive warehouse complex of at least 5 buildings caught on fire in Buffalo, New York on 111 Tonawanda Street, sending a plume of thick, jet black colored smoke into the air that could be seen as far away as 40 miles.As of 6:40 a.m., the fire was under control, and firefighters were attempting to stop it from spreading, but could not get to the center of the fire because of severe amounts of debris. Later in the morning, the fire was extinguished."The fire is mostly under debris at this point.  It's under control, but it's under some debris.  We really can't get to it.  We're just going to have to keep on pouring water on it so it doesn't spread," said Thomas Ashe, the fire chief for the North Buffalo based fire division who also added that at one point, at least 125 firefighters were on the scene battling the blaze. One suffered minor injures and was able to take himself to the hospital to seek medical attention.Shortly after 8:00 p.m. as many as 3 explosions rocked the warehouse sending large mushroom clouds of thick black smoke into the air. After the third explosion, heat could be felt more than 100 feet away. The fire started in the front, one story building then quickly spread to three others, but fire fighters managed to stop the flames from spreading onto the 3 story building all the way at the back. According to a Buffalo Police officer, who wished not to be named, the fire began at about 7:00 p.m. [Eastern time], starting as a one alarm fire. By 8:00 p.m., three fire companies were on the scene battling the blaze. Police also say that a smaller fire was reported in the same building on Saturday night, which caused little damage.At the start of the fire, traffic was backed up nearly 4 miles on the 198 expressway going west toward the 190 Interstate and police had to shut down the Tonawanda street exit because the road is too close to the fire. At one point, traffic on the 198 was moving so slow, at least a dozen people were seen getting out of their cars and walking down the expressway to watch the fire. That prompted as many as 10 police cars to be dispatched to the scene to force individuals back into their cars and close off one of the 2 lanes on the westbound side.One woman, who wished not to be named as she is close to the owner of the warehouse, said the building is filled with "classic cars, forklifts, and money" and that owner "does not have insurance" coverage on the property. The building is not considered abandoned, but firefighters said that it is vacant.Officials in Fort Erie, Ontario were also swamped with calls to fire departments when the wind blew the smoke over the Niagra River and into Canada.It is not known what caused the fire, but a car is suspected to have caught on fire and there are reports from police and hazmat crews, that there were also large barrels of diesel fuel being stored in one building. Firefighters say the cause of the blaze is being treated as "suspicious." The ATF is investigating the fire and will bring dogs in to search the debris.No injuries were reported when firefighters were called to two London Underground stations when the smell of smoke was reported and seen, said police.A spokeswoman for London Transport police said firefighters had checked reports of smoke coming from the Bakerloo line, but the incident was not threatening.

The body was later identified as Elmaz Qyra, a middle-aged resident of Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. Qyra was found by a passerby around 3:30 p.m. local time (11:30 UTC), and was pronounced dead by authorities at the scene.One witness, who would not release his name, said, "It was obviously a direct hit to his head. There was this big pool of blood spreading through the snow. It was horrifying."Qyra's shift at The New York Athletic Club (NYAC) had likely just ended. "It happened at the time he finished working. He might have been trying to get home." said Gaz Bharmi, Qyra's brother-in-law. "The breaking of the branch and the other fallen trees were likely caused by the accumulation of wet, unusually heavy snow," the New York Parks Department said in a statement.Qyra, an immigrant from Albania, came to New York with his family ten years ago in order provide them with a better life. Qyra "loved" Central Park, and would regularly have his teenage children meet him there after finishing his health club shift. "He goes there every summer with the kids to take picture and have hot dogs," Bharmi remarked. Cesar Zuzunaga, Qyra's NYAC supervisor said, "He was always talking about his family, and he was family to us here."Funeral services are scheduled for Monday.Thousands of mourning Nigerian Muslims have gathered outside the temple of the late Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Maccido, waiting to pay their last respects following his death in a plane crash on Sunday, along with 95 others on board.

A freelance cameraman who works for the BBC and Reuters said he heard an unusual noise from a single helicopter's engine and describes it crashing with flames and smoke pouring from the engine, and local police say a helicopter was downed by enemy fire.There are also reports of gunfire after the crash. The US military has denied any knowledge of a shootdown.Heavy violence, drought, and soaring food prices mean that half of the population of the African country of Somalia is in immediate need of food aid in order to prevent a famine, according to a new study.Every sixth child under the age of five is acutely malnourished, and three and a quarter million people are in need of immediate aid, a number 77% higher than last year, according to the Food Security Analysis Unit (FSAU), which is based in Nairobi, Kenya.Few aid agencies are able to operate in Somalia, due mainly to the high levels of violence there: almost one hundred ships being seized by pirates in Somali waters this year, and 23 aid workers have been killed in the country, with a further 18 abducted, in 2008 alone. Most international humanitarian staff have been forced to leave the country, and even Somali staff are finding it hard to function. "The escalating conflict, civil insecurity, and instability in Somalia is now fueling an economic crisis that is beginning to have a wider and more devastating impact on the broader population," said FSAU's chief technical advisor, Cindy Holleman.Alexandre Liebeskind, The International Red Cross's East African division head, said that this crisis is comparable to the 1992 Somalia famine, in which between 202,000 and 238,000 people died of starvation. The Red Cross has called for the country's borders to be opened, and for its residents to be allowed to cross and flee from the impending disaster.Beaches in Cape Town, South Africa have reopened after being closed for two days. They were closed after a man from Zimbabwe was killed by a shark on the Fish Hoek beach. The man was attacked by a great white shark while around 100 meters off shore on Tuesday. An official for Cape Town released a statement saying that "although the beaches have been declared safe, both shark spotting and lifesaving services will continue.” He added that visitors to the beach should remain in groups and go no further than waist deep in the ocean. Several eye witnesses viewed the attack on Tuesday. Swimmer Kyle Johnston spoke to a Cape Town newspaper, saying: "We looked at the walkway and saw people waving towels at us, then we looked further out to sea and saw what looked like blood, and a man's leg come up."  This was the second fatal shark attack on the same beach since 2004, when an elderly women died when she was attacked by a great white shark while swimming.His friends and family observed in horror as his jet-powered car, after covering a mere 700 m, flipped over and disintegrated.

Heynes helicopters, contracted to fight fires on the mountain, are assisting from the air. However since the main water reservoirs near the Vredehoek area are shrouded in smoke and water must be retrieved from the harbour instead.So far one elderly woman has reportedly died due to smoke inhalation and many others may be at risk as they attempt to defend their homes. Firefighters have been attempting to bring the situation under control throughout the night but the blaze continues unabated.The cause of the fire is still uncertain. However a 36-year-old British man has been placed under arrest for allegedly dropping a lit cigarette whilst on the mountain.Fires in the area are an annual problem and may threaten to destroy the delicate indigenous fynbos ecosystem. Opinions about the effects of the fires on the mountain vary, however, with some specialists indicating that regular fires could cause permanent damage to the ecosystem whilst others believe that the fynbos is actually partially reliant on the heat of the fire to set off the shedding of seeds.In previous years the area around Muizenberg and Fishhoek have been ravaged by fires of similar intensity. The scars of those fires still remain.Leon van Biljon, owner of Mahala View Lion Lodge near Pretoria, South Africa, was killed by his lions on Tuesday. Van Biljon, reportedly often referred to as "The Lion Man", had been in the lions' area attempting to mend a fence at the time, according to local news media.Mahala View Lion Lodge formerly billed itself as home to three lions: Rambo, Katryn and Nakita.

More than a hundred injuries were reported, with eighteen people in critical condition. This is the highest death toll from fire in South Korea in almost a decade.The fire is believed to have started at about 7:30 local time, according to fire chief Choi Man-woo. It originated on the ground floor in the emergency room as per various officials. The hospital has 98 beds and a medical staff of about 35, and specializes in long-term care of elderly patients. It adjoins a nursing home, all of whose 94 residents were evacuated. Staff carried some patients out of the hospital on their backs.One patient, Jang Yeong-jae, who told his story to JoongAng Ilbo, said he escaped by removing a screen from a window to get to a ladder placed by firefighters. He described people "running around in panic, falling over and screaming as smoke filled the rooms". The majority of the victims died from smoke inhalation and are believed to be elderly, said the head of the city's public hospital, Chun Jae-kyung. A doctor, a nurse, and a nursing assistant have died, according to the fire service; it took three hours to put out the fire.In a press briefing, Seok Gyeong-sik, the director of the hospital, apologized to patients and their families.

At least three people survived the accident. The vessel lost contact with another boat on Saturday, and was found yesterday near the island of Jejudo. The capsized vessel, the 9.8 tonne Dolphin, had 22 people on its passenger list. The actual number of passengers is unclear; not all of those passengers have boarded as planned, and one survivor was not listed in the passenger list. News agency Yonhap quoted one survivor as saying big waves caused the accident. "I was sleeping when the boat’s engine went off and the captain told us to get out and water started to fill the boat, I was the last to come outside and as soon as I did, the boat capsized."The survivor says not all of the passengers on the boat were equipped with life jackets. He added some passengers holding on to the capsized boat were swept away by the waves as they lost strength.The coastguard says 44 boats were involved in the ensuing rescue operation.This accident comes after a South Korean ferry sank last year, killing around 300. In December a fishing trawler accident killed around 50.A South Korean naval vessel, the ROKS Cheonan, with around 100 crew members on board is reported to have sunk near the disputed maritime border with North Korea. While initial reports said the cause may have been a torpedo attack by North Korea, South Korean officials have since denied any military altercation.The 1,200 tonne ship was reported to have begun sinking between 9:30 and 10:45 PM local time (1345 UTC) on Friday night near Baengnyeong Island. While no cause was confirmed by authorities, an explosion occurred in the rear of the ship and there was much speculation about the possibility of a North Korean torpedo attack. A spokesperson for the government, however, said that judgement on the cause was being withheld until an investigation was conducted,  and South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that there was insufficient evidence to implicate North Korea. By the day after the incident, South Korean officials had said that North Korea was not involved, as there was no indication of North Korean military activity in the area the ship sank.The Yonhap news agency said that a South Korean ship had fired shots at another, unidentified, North Korean vessel, although whether the incident occurred before or after the vessel began sinking is unclear. A later report said that the target may have been merely a flock of birds.According to the ship's captain, one of those who was rescued, there was "the sound of an explosion and the ship keeled to the right." The initial explosion caused the ship to lose power and communications, and the ship sank rapidly, with the rear underwater five minutes after the explosion.A rescue operation was immediately undertaken by South Korea, with several of the involved vessels rescuing 58 people. The remaining 46 that were on board the ship are presently unaccounted for, and it is increasingly unlikely that any more survivors will be picked up. The South Korean government has convened an emergency meeting in response to the incident, and the military has activated an emergency task force.The sea around the Korean peninsula has been the site of previous incidents between the two navies, including deadly battles in 1999 and 2002, and a smaller firefight last year.An overturned tanker exploded in Western Equatoria, South Sudan yesterday, killing dozens.The death toll is unclear.

County commissioner Wilson Thomas Yanga in remarks to the BBC put the toll at a minimum of 176.The Red Cross said it had sent two burn kits to local rescuers in Maridi with provisions for 100 patients. Kisanga warns the toll may increase "because we do not have the facilities to treat the highly burnt people." Radio Tamazuj spoke to a doctor who reported reserves of painkillers, oxygen, and other consumables were being exhausted.Some casualties may have fled the scene. Reportedly, after the driver walked away from the crash to seek assistance, local residents began stealing petrol. South Sudan has few paved roads. Mass casualty fuel explosions are common in poor regions of East Africa.Strong storms hit the southeastern United States on Friday. Crews are currently working to restore power to the area.

The quake struck at 8:18 p.m. (Pacific Time) on Friday night.The epicenter was located 56 kilometers (35 miles) East of Barstow and 188 k.m. (116 miles) East, Northeast of Los Angeles. So far there are no reports of damage or injuries. Over 21,000 people live in Barstow."[The quake was] relatively shallow and if it were located in a more populated area it could be very damaging, but it's out in the middle of the desert, in the middle of nowhere," said Richard Buckmaster, a seismologist for the USGS.The quake was recorded at a depth of 5 km (3.1 miles). Reports say that the shaking could be felt as far away as San Diego where it shook the sheriff's office building. The shaking was also felt in Los Angeles. Nearly a dozen aftershocks ranging from magnitudes 1.0 to 2.5, have been recorded in the same location since the main event.Recently, a magnitude 5.4 earthquake struck downtown Los Angeles, but caused no damage or injuries. The earthquake's epicenter was located near a golf course in an upscale community 3 km (2 miles) Southwest from Chino Hills, or 47 km (29 miles) East, Southeast of Los Angeles (33.959° N 117.752° W). The most recent damaging quake to hit Southern California was the January 17, 1994 Northridge quake in Reseda.

Pilot error has not been identified as a cause for the crash, but investigators caution it is to early for any conclusions to be made.Graphics released by the Star Tribune show that the plane ended up past the runway it was attempting to land on. The Associated Press reports that debris was scattered 500 feet beyond the runway.The bodies have been taken to Rochester for examination, while the plane's data recorders have been flown to Washington, DC.Both WCCO-TV and the Star Tribune report that the time of the crash coincided with a line of storms moving through the area, though what effect, if any the storm had, is under investigation. Witnesses told the Star Tribune that the worst of the storm had gone at the time of the crash and only light wind and rain remained. The Associated Press confirms from the National Weather Service that "the storms were subsiding at the time of the crash."Owatonna resident John Billingsly, a retired pilot who worked at the airport for many years, told the Star Tribune, "I saw the plane making its final approach, and it appeared nothing was wrong. We'd just had a lot of wind, but it had calmed down a bit and mostly subsided by that time."The plane, a charter for Viracon, Inc. of Owatonna, was flying customers from "a couple of different companies" to discuss a $2 billion dollar casino and hotel project in Las Vegas, Nevada that Revel Entertainment is building. Atlantic City Mayor Scott Evans told the Associated Press that two high-level employees for Revel and an employee of Tishman Construction. Viracon is an architectural glass fabricator and Tishman is assisting Revel.As of 5:00 a.m Friday, five of the victims, including the two pilots, have been identified by the Associated press.APG International, a company specializing in glass facades, lost two executives: Marc Rosenberg, the chief operating officer, and Alan Barnett, an assistant project manager, according to the Glassboro, N.J. company's spokeswoman Amelia Townsend. The Tishman empoyee, the only victim identified, was project manager Karen Sandland, 44, based in Newark, New Jersey company spokesman Bud Perrone told the Associated Press.The Revel employee's idenities were released by the Star Tribune Friday, they are: Tony Craig, 50, of Brigantine, N.J., vice president of construction development; Chris Daul, 44, of Northfield, N.J., vice president of construction development; and Lawrence (Chip) Merrigan, 62, of Absecon N.J., director of field operations.The crash is the deadliest in Minnesota since October 2002, when Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone and seven others died after their chartered twin-engine plane crashed in the woods near Eveleth, in Northern Minnesota, according to the Star Tribune.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent agency responsible for investigation of accidents involving aviation, highway, marine, pipelines and railroads in the United States (except aircraft of the armed forces and the intelligence agencies), will be investigating the crash.The NTSB reported Friday through the Star Tribute that the agency has 14 investigators working on the crash, with assistance from the FBI.The NTSB reports two other fatal accidents since 1962 at Owatonna airport. A crash in 1992 killed one and injured another and a crash in 2004 killed four people.A Southern Sudan Air Connection aircraft has crashed today in Southern Sudan, killing over a dozen people, including the area's defence minister.There are conflicting reports on how many people were on board and how many died in the Bahr Gazal crash, but at least twenty people were on board. Some sources suggest nineteen fatalities and two survivors, and others say there were 26 deaths and no survivors; it should be noted that if either of these were correct then there were more than twenty on board. Lieutenant General Dominic Dim Deng, the area's defence minister, is confirmed to be dead and it is thought at least 19 military officials are now deceased."The plane had been rented from a charter company and was carrying a delegation of leaders from the (former rebel) Sudan People's Liberation Movement from Wau to the capital Juba," said Luka Mariak, spokesman for the Souther Sudan president Salva Kiir. This makes the journey around 450 kilometres (290 miles), with the plane crashing in a flat region 375 kilometres (around 220 miles) from Juba. It is reported it subsequently caught fire.The United Nations said that the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) had dispatched a helicopter to assist the emergency response effort. The UN also said that the aircraft was a Beechcraft 1900 and that they would fly in government officials and aviation experts to conduct an investigation. The site has been cordoned off.Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, UNMIS's Secretary-General's Special Representative, offered his condolences to the government on behalf of both UNMIS and th UN as a whole.Kiir said in a press conference "Twenty-one passengers were killed and either two or three crew members. Two engines failed and there was nothing the pilot could do."Justin Yak and his wife are also confirmed to be dead. Yak was the minister for cabinet affairs until a 2007 reshuffle left him removed from office. He was an adviser to the president at the time of his death. Bodies were flown into Juba Airport were relatives waited for hours for news. UNMIS is expected to fly the bodies on to their nearby airfield, to which there is no public access.The disaster is thought to be an accident caused by mechanical trouble. The pilot had contacted Air Traffic Control (ATC) to report engine problems and requested permission to conduct an emergency landing at nearby Rumbek. ATC lost contact minutes later.Southwest Airlines Flight 812 carrying 118 passengers between Phoenix, Arizona and Sacramento, California was forced to divert to the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station in Arizona, after a hole appeared in the top of the aircraft; the plane landed safely at Yuma.The plane was forced to make an emergency descent down to 11,000 feet and reportedly descended 16,000 feet in one minute. One passenger identified as Cindy said, "[t]hey had just taken drink orders when I heard a huge sound and oxygen masks came down and we started making a rapid decent. They said we’d be making an emergency landing. There was a hole in the fuselage about three feet long. You could see the insulation and the wiring. You could see a tear the length of one of the ceiling panels."In a statement issued by Southwest Airlines they informed that, "Southwest Airlines Flight 812, the scheduled 3:25 pm departure from Phoenix to Sacramento today, diverted to Yuma, Ariz due to loss of pressurization in the cabin. Upon safely landing in Yuma, the flight crew discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft. There are no reported Customer injuries. One of the Flight Attendants, however, received a minor injury upon descent."Southwest Airlines have provided a replacement aircraft to take the 118 passengers to Sacramento. The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed it is investigating "an in-flight fuselage rupture."A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700 skidded off the runway at the Chicago Midway Airport on Thursday evening.  The Southwest Airlines flight 1248 was en route to Midway from Baltimore-Washington International Airport. The aircraft attempted the landing at approximately 7:15 p.m. local time under heavy snow, and skidded off the runway, crashing through a steel barrier surrounding the airport and on to a residential street.There were 98 passengers on the flight, two of them were reportedly injured and taken to a local hospital and the rest were bussed to the airport terminal.Reports indicate that two vehicles were damaged. One of the vehicles was still lodged under the aircraft when police and fire officials arrived on the scene. Taken to the Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oaklawn were two adults and three children who were extracted from one of the vehicles the aircraft hit. One of the children, a 6-year-old boy from Indiana named Joshua Woods, has died from injuries suffered from the crash. The conditions of the other victims are still unknown.The accident is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and a final report is expected in about a year.The USGS has reported a 6.3 magnitude earthquake in Spain. It had a depth of 616.7 kilometers. The epicenter was located 25 kilometers northeast from Granada, 106 kilometers northwest of Málaga and 341 kilometers south of Madrid. It occurred on Monday at 00:08:10 local time (22:08:10 UTC). People posted via Twitter that the earthquake was felt in Cádiz, Málaga, and Murcia.CNN reports there are no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or damages. "An earthquake with that depth means little damage is likely," seismologist Susan Potter told CNN. She also stated that "when an earthquake is deeper, the seismic energy is absorbed by the Earth, so there will be less damage expected in the epicenter area."Meanwhile, almost a month ago, on March 1, the Spanish Geologist Luis Eugénio Suarez, said that the Granada area could suffer an earthquake within the short term, and with an intensity similar to that of the February 27 Cauquenes, Chile earthquake. Suárez commented that "Spain is not like Chile," because the latter is located on a high seismic frequency area, but also noted that "once every hundred years, a destructive earthquake is produced in the peninsula."The last earthquake in Spain was in Arenas del Rey, in Granada, 126 years ago, and reached a magnitude of 6.6, leaving between 750 to 900 dead, thousands injured and material destruction.Three Spanair mechanics—including the head of maintenance for the airline in the area—are to be questioned under suspicion of manslaughter in connection to the Spanair Flight 5022 disaster. The other two workers checked the plane, a MD-82, before the failed takeoff at Madrid that killed 154 and left only eighteen survivors.The aircraft, destined for the Canary Islands, failed to maintain altitude after takeoff from Barajas Airport.A preliminary report concluded that the wing flaps were not correctly set for takeoff, and an alarm that should have sounded to alert the flight crew to this problem failed. No reasons have been determined for these occurrences.A judge has now summoned the head of Spanair maintenance at Barajas and the two mechanics who checked the aircraft. They were summoned by Juan Javier Perez of Madrid’s Superior Court, who heads the judicial enquiry into the accident. Aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas—which has since merged with Boeing—has suggested that operators should check the wing flaps before every flight. However, Spanair only checked them every morning and after each change in flight crew. The recommendation came after the 1987 crash of Northwest Flight 255.So far, no one has been charged with a crime.File:Galvez Isaac.jpgWorld Madison champion Isaac Gálvez Lopez died in the early hours of Sunday morning after crashing on the fifth day of the Six Days of Ghent track cycling race.He collided with Belgium's Dimitri DeFauw during the second Madison of the evening and hit a metal barrier. He was immediately knocked unconscious, and despite being resuscitated, he was pronounced dead at the Gent University Clinic hospital.The race was immediately suspended, and the final day's racing was cancelled.At the time of the accident, Gálvez and team-mate Juan Llaneras were lying second in the overall standings, one lap behind the Belgium/German pair Iljo Keisse and Robert Bartko.In 2003, a Yak-42 chartered from Ukraine to take Spanish soldiers home from Afghanistan crashed in Turkey. Sixty-two Spanish soldiers and thirteen crew from Ukraine and Belarus were killed. General Vicente Navarro was designated to head a team to travel to Turkey and repatriate the bodies.This team was then informed by Turkish coroners that thirty of the bodies were so badly maimed that visual identification was impossible and DNA tests would be required to identify these victims. The Spanish victims were then transported back to Spain, on the understanding that DNA tests would be carried out in Spain. Instead, two days later they were given a state funeral with thirty identities randomly assigned to the thirty unidentified bodies. When the situation became apparent months later, the bodies had to be exhumed for identification.Navarro was today sentenced to a €1,800 fine, a two-year ban from office and a three-year prison sentence after his conviction for falsifying records. It is the first time the National Court has imposed any sentence on a general. Also sentenced today were Commandant José Ramírez and Captain Miguel Sáez, who were responsible for producing the flawed autopsy reports. Each received an 18-month jail sentence.The case is not yet over, as Ramírez and Sáez may have the court consider suspending their sentences, while Navarro is intending an appeal to the Supreme Court. Navarro had admitted that there may have been mistakes made, but blamed errors made by the Turkish authorities. Ramírez and Sáez, meanwhile, had stated that they were clear as to what appropriate procedure entailed, but said that they were obeying orders.As winds in the UK reach 124 mph, a Spanish fishing trawler is missing off the coast of Scotland and three people have died in northern Britain.The UK Coastguard received an emergency beacon signal via satellite at 2330 UTC last night from a boat in the North Atlantic, 180 miles west of Scotland. No voice radio traffic had been received since the ship's owners talked to the captain at 2030, when the crew reported that they were in difficulties and were losing power. There are 19 crew members on board, five Spansish and fourteen Portuguese. An RAF Nimrod search aircraft is due on-scene at dawn to search for the vessel.Two lorries have been blown over. In Scotland, the lorry fell onto a car, killing the driver. In Northern Ireland, the lorry was blown off a bridge into the sea, killing the driver of the lorry. A third person died in Scotland when a van was blown into the path of an on-coming lorry. Across Scotland, 60,000 people are without power, many roads are blocked by fallen trees, trains are not running and ferries are restricted to port. The Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in northern England has suffered superficial damage.On Friday, a strong earthquake in Japan triggered a massive tsunami throughout the Pacific Ocean. Chilean President Sebastián Piñera declared a "preventive tsunami warning" that morning. "I want to express my, and Chilean people's solidarity with the Japanese government and people, who were hit by one of the worse earthquakes and tsunamis in the history of mankind," Piñera said. Later that day, the tsunami first reached Chilean territory in Easter Island, without causing any damage.Meanwhile, in Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region, the tsunami warning caused panic amid people. "It reminds me of 4 October 1994 [after an earthquake in Russia provoked a tsunami throughout the Pacific], when we had to leave everything and either go to the hill or Santa Cruz," ((es))Spanish language: ‍Me recuerda del 4 de octubre de 1994, cuando tuvimos que dejarlo todo e ir ya sea al cerro o a Santa Cruz. a fisherman told Wikinews.Schools executed the Francisca Cooper Integral Evacuation and School Safety Plan, a preventive emergency operation against earthquakes, fires, and other emergencies, during Friday morning. The operation, officially called "Cooper Plan", is named after Francisca Cooper, killed in Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami.During the afternoon, people living or owning stores, restaurants, and kiosks near the beach began to take their belongings away, due to the potential damage the tsunami would cause. Police officers did not allow cars to pass by the nearest street to the beach, the Costanera Avenue, especially in the Cardenal Caro Province Government area; however, curious people traveling on foot were able to see the strong waves hitting the Pichilemu shoreline before the eventual tsunami. The Agustín Ross Balcony was used mostly for that purpose, until Investigations Police of Chile (Chilean equivalent to the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation) told people to leave the area because "it was dangerous."At around 16:30 local time (19:30 UTC), the Intendant of O'Higgins Region, Rodrigo Pérez Mackenna, arrived at Pichilemu Municipal Stadium in a helicopter, to inform Mayor Roberto Córdova of what he and other authorities should do because of the emergency, according to reports.Fishermen took their boats away from the beach. "I don't want to lose it [the boat] again, we were already very affected by the February 27 earthquake and I just don't want that to happen again; we still have time," a fisherman, Manuel González said.At around 21:30 local time (00:30 UTC), heavy rain began to fall in the city. Most of the people who evacuated to the La Cruz Hill quickly went back to their houses, despite most of them being too close to the beach to be safe. Some of them preferred to stay in refuges provided by the municipality of Pichilemu: the Pichilemu Municipal Gymnasium, and the Pueblo de Viudas Primary School. Fabricio Cáceres said on Canal 3 Pichilemu that "people should stay calm," and that the tsunami "would not be any worse than February 27's." Personnel of the Pichilemu Police, the Pichilemu Fire Bureau, and Investigations Police of Chile kept on patrolling the city's streets.The Pichilemu Hospital, located around 100 meters from the beach, was moved temporarily to the Agustín Ross Edwards High School facilities.The tsunami waves finally hit Pichilemu at around 03:30 local time (06:30 UTC) on Saturday, damaging some kiosks that were too close to the beach. In Playa Hermosa, around three kilometers south of the center of the city, the tsunami even reached houses and cabañas, but caused no damage. Some reports on Radio Entre Olas say that the tsunami reached up to 70 meters inland. According to Hernán de Solminihac, Minister of Public Works, Pichilemu's Caleta de Pescadores (Fishermen Creek, almost completely destroyed on February 27, 2010 after that day's earthquake) suffered minor damage.The tsunami warning was lifted in most of Chilean territory but "Arica, Iquique, Antofagüasta [sic], Caldera, Constitución, Talcahuano, and Lebu," by Sebastián Piñera at 10:45 local time (13:45 UTC) on Saturday.Governor of Cardenal Caro Julio Ibarra said that "around 10,000 people were evacuated in Pichilemu to Pueblo de Viudas or La Cruz Hill," and that the tsunami was "just meters away from affecting the [Cardenal Caro] province government building."A spectator has been killed and at least 10 people injured after an aircraft struck spectators at an airshow in Germany yesterday. The one-engined propellor-driven aircraft exited the runway after failing to take off and ploughed into a group that had congregated around a snack stand.The accident occurred at Kindel Air Field, which is located south of Berlin, near Eisenach. The aircraft involved was a Zlin Z-37 Cmelak, a Czech built single-seater plane which had been used by authorities in former East Germany as a cropduster.A 45-year-old woman was killed, and the 35-year-old pilot had to be freed from his wrecked aircraft and was badly injured. A 14-year-old girl is hospitalised in a critical condition, according to Bloomberg, although other sources suggest the 14-year-old and a nine-year-old child were amongst those less seriously injured. Some reports suggest 15 people were wounded by the crash, and German TV network ZDF suggested the plane struck a children's carousel near the runway's end and not a refreshments stall.Thousands of people were evacuated from Northtown Mall, in Spokane, WA following complaints that unknown fumes were causing throat irritation and blocked throats at around 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time on Sunday. Eight people were moved to hospital by ambulance while others reached hospital on their own. None are believed to be in a life-threatening condition.Firefighters on scene used specialized equipment to attempt to identify air contaminants, but initial tests were "unconclusive".  Hazardous materials crews continued to investigate the nature of the fumes during the later afternoon after closure of the mall. Firefighters have deemed the mall safe, and mall security allowed certain staff to perform the mall closing operations. The mall is expected to open as usual on Monday.Since last reported, the flooding in Pakistan has spread and has now struck more than four million people. The UN reports it has left at least 1,600 people dead. The floods have been confirmed as the worst in eighty years.Heavy monsoon rains led to the flooding of the huge Indus River, destroying homes in the north of the country and causing a large amount of damage in the north-west frontier province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Manuel Bessler of the United Nations said: "What we are facing now is a major catastrophe. We are afraid it will get worse.”Army and government forces have rushed to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from parts of the Punjab province of Pakistan, where the disaster spread to yesterday, and from Sindh province, where the flood is expected to reach by the weekend.The flooding is now in its second week and the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, especially since in many parts of the country there is still torrential rain, with more forecast. In other parts of Pakistan the water has receded, but this leaves a layer of mud and slime and this covers very large areas. For those affected by the floods, disease is the biggest problem now. The insanitary conditions have already caused diarrhoea and respiratory infections. Cholera and other water-borne diseases may appear if sanitary conditions for those displaced by the calamity are not established. Medical supplies are desperately needed for doctors to keep a pandemic or epidemic of a water-borne disease from infecting the victims of the flooding.A storm has knocked out power during a heat wave in the Greater St. Louis Area. 80 mph (130 km/h) winds accompanied by heavy rain caused many tree limbs to fall, some onto cars, some onto thoroughfares, and some on high-tension power lines that supply the city.  It also caused at least three building collapses. After 160,000 people have had their power restored, but 500,000 others are still without power. Three hundred national guardsmen joined volunteers, policemen and firefighters in aiding people during the crisis.Vulnerable residents in nursing homes and centers for the elderly are being evacuated. Cookies and water are being distributed to those needing them. With temperatures were nearing 100°F (38°C), ice was in short supply as customers grabbed all they could get their hands on."I've never seen this many people without power, this much debris, buildings collapsed, lines down," St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said.The local power company, AmerenUE, estimated that as of 10:26 p.m. local Central time on the 20th, 418,195 customers had no electricity.On Saturday, a large tent near Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri was lifted from the ground with an estimated 150 people inside it.  One person died at a nearby hospital and sixteen others were hospitalized.  Almost 100 other people were treated at the scene for minor injuries including one broken arm, according to officials.The incident occurred just before 4 p.m. central time behind Kilroy's, a bar just south of Busch Stadium.  The storm produced winds of 50 mph which lifted the tent and blew it into a neighboring railroad trestle.  "I thought a train fell off the track," said owner of Kilroy's, Art Randall.  City guidelines mandate the tent should have withstood 90 mph winds.  The tent had been issued a permit by the city.  Frank Oswald, building commissioner, said the tent had been inspected two days after the permit was issued.  The cause of the failure has not been determined, but the fire marshal is investigating.   A total of eleven medical units helped at the scene, and numerous fire departments showed up, according to Deputy Fire Chief John Altmann. The patrons not paying attention to weather warnings may have contributed to the amount of injuries, Altmann said at a press conference held four hours after the incident.  "Anytime we put a lot of people in open areas and you have hazardous weather, it is a dangerous situation," said Altmann.The huge forest fires that blazed across southern Greece on Friday and Saturday were stabilized for a few hours today.Fire Brigade Officer Nikos Tsogas said, "It's not getting worse...we have to act fast because the winds might pick up." However, the winds have reportedly intensified. Fire department spokesman Nikos Diamandis said, "Unfortunately the improvement that we were looking for is not there...Our target is for the fire not to enter Ancient Olympia, not to destroy antiquities." Fire is surrounding villages just a few miles away from Ancient Olympia.Several new fires also broke out today in Phiotida in central Greece. The worst fires continue to burn in the southern mountains of Peloponnese, where some blazes involve 42 major fronts.The fires have killed at least 63 people. Some reports indicate that an unspecified number are also missing.Meanwhile, Greek authorities announced that they have made two arrests in the case. The first, a 65-year-old man, was reportedly seen torching trees across southern Peloponnese. The second person arrested and charged was a 77-year-old woman who reportedly was seen starting a fire while cooking outside in Zaharo. The Associated Press reports seven other people have been detained. Officer Tsogas said authorities are investigating reports of a cell phone attached to an explosive gas canister found after a smaller fire in mountain Ymittos in Athens.Greek private TV station "mega channel" has reported that more than one fire-starting mechanisms connected to cell phones have been found by volunteering citizens that are trying to help the authorities.Meanwhile the government has announced rewards ranging from 100,000 euros to one million euros for information on arsonists involved in this week's barrage of wildfire ravaging much of southern Greece.The Greek government has declared a state of emergency.At least 12 European countries are sending aid and resources.A stadium disaster has claimed well over a dozen lives in the Ivory Coast. A crush, which may have occurred after a wall collapse, took place today at the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Stadium in Abidjan and according to interior minister Desire Tagro killed 22 people and wounded 132 others.Different sources put the dead at 19. "We have 19 dead and many seriously injured," a member of the military told Reuters. The Sports Minister gave this version of events: "Spectators who did not buy tickets were jostling before the match. They smashed one of the main gates of the stadium. They were trampled." Tagro also said that fans trying to get in were crushed.According to Sky Sports, a wall collapse caused the fatalities while the injured were hurt when pushing spectators caused a panic which became a stampede. 50,000 people had turned up to watch a qualifying match for the football 2010 World Cup between Ivory Coast and Malawi. The Associated Press also said that police used tear gas in an effort to control the crowd.The match was sold out due to low-price tickets. The game went ahead despite the pre-match incident and the Ivory Coast side won 5-0.Two probes have been initiated into the collapse of the Big Valley Jamboree stage which killed one person, placed four others in the critical care unit and caused injuries to 75 others in Camrose, Alberta located in Canada.  "We are trying to determine from what is left of the evidence what damage was done by the wind and what damage was down by rescue workers.  We may not be able to make that determination. So that is going to hamper things. It will be tougher," Chris Chodan, spokesman for Alberta Occupational Health and Safety. Panhandle Productions has brought in independent investigators to determine why the stage collapsed and to collect evidence. Due to the large number of people trapped under the stage the evidence had to be moved for rescue operations. The stage collapsed shortly before 6:00 p.m. local time on Saturday killing 35-year-old Donna Moore, who was attending the festival from Lloydminster. Premier Global Productions supplies the stage for the event, which are transported from venue to venue in sections via three semi trailers.  "It's their stage.  In fact, I know this stage has been used by Paul McCartney, it's been used by Metallica, and by Tim McGraw on tour." said Larry Werner the producer from Panhandle Productions.The stage is suspected to have been brought down by a phenomenon called plough wind, which produces winds similar to a tornado. This particular front hit speeds greater than 100 km/hr (62 mi/hr). A plough wind travels in narrow straight line paths rather than in circular formations, but causes damage similar to that inflicted by a tornado.Alberta Municipal Affairs has initiated their investigation into the engineering specifications of the stage and emergency procedures. Alberta occupational health and safety is investigating building codes.The Big Valley Jamboree is a large annual country music festival located in Camrose, Alberta, Canada which sees 25,000 people attending the four day event.Over 40 people were injured, three of them seriously, after the auditorium floor collapsed at a church in Abbotsford, BC, Canada.Around 9:20 pm PDT Friday night an approximated 900 square foot section of the stage and floor collapsed at a Starfield concert attended by as many as 1200 people at Central Heights Church. Reports from the concert goers indicate that sound and lighting scaffolds collapsed onto the front section of the stage and mosh pit, though it is not yet clear whether this was the cause of or the result of the floor collapsing into the basement 15 feet below.Abbotsford Police Constable Casey Vinet stated that all available city police, fire and ambulance units responded to the scene, along with units from neighboring jurisdictions.The incident apparently took place due to overcrowding at the entrance to the grounds of the event, located in Duisburg, Germany, which more than a million people were reported to have attended. Despite warnings by police of overcrowding, more people tried to enter the grounds. There is speculation that the panic may have begun when people fell after trying to cross a barrier, and subsequently spread.Witness Udo Sandhoefer said that people "climbed up the walls and tried somehow to get into the grounds from the side, and the people in the crowd that moved up simply ran over those who were lying on the ground."Emergency responders apparently encountered difficulties in reaching those in need of assistance due to the number of people in the area.  Officials also decided not to evacuate the grounds of the event, citing concerns that a larger panic would be sparked if more people knew of the deaths.A woman attending the event said that "[t]here were piles of injured on the ground, some being resuscitated, others dead and covered with sheets. It was way too full in the afternoon, everybody wanted to get in."A statement from president Christian Wulff said that "[i]t is terrible that such a catastrophe brought death, suffering and pain to a peaceful festival full of happy young people from many countries."The mayor of Duisburg, Adolf Sauerland, said that security measures at the event were sufficient, and that an investigation into the incident was already under way.A stampede in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi has killed at least five people and left at least 79 more wounded, reports say.The incident occurred at a church rally, led by Christian leaders voicing their opposition to a new constitution to be voted on in a referendum later this summer, primarily because it is to include a clause for abortion.A petrol bomb apparently was thrown into the crowd as the rally was drawing to a close at dusk, prompting panic as people tried to flee. Some witness reports suggest there were two individual blasts. According to police, the explosions were not large and didn't leave any damage.Kenyan prime minister Raila Odinga was present at the scene of the disaster. He commented on the incident, saying: "It is a very, very regrettable incident, and this incident is condemned in the strongest terms possible. We don't know as yet the cause of this incident."It was not immediately clear who was responsible for detonating the bomb. Spokesman for Kenyan police Eric Kiraithe said that "[i]t is very, very much too early to say who is responsible. Our investigations have begun, and in due course the culprits will be found."At least 140 people have been killed and fifty people injured in a stampede at the temple in Naina Devi, India. The incident occurred after rumors spread about a landslide on the nearby mountain. One report indicated at least 40 of the victims were children.The chief minister of Himachal Pradesh announced that he would give compensation to the injured and the families of the dead.50,000 people were expected to attend the temple during the day of the stampede, as part of a nine-day Shravan Navratras festival which had just started. Rajnath Singh, the current leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party in India responded to the stampede by releasing a statement in the hours after the disaster."I am deeply saddened to learn about the tragic death of over 100 pilgrims. I convey my deep felt condolences to the family members of all those who have lost their lives or have been injured in the incident," he said.Meanwhile, Kumar Dhumal, the chief minister for Himachal, has announced an inquiry into the disaster.Press reports say stampedes at temples are not rare occurrences. The Times Online says that about 80% of India's population 1.1 billion is Hindu. Temples can be a gathering place for over 100,000 people during festivals.In July, a stampede in the eastern Puri killed six people. In March, 9 died when a railing broke in central India. In 2005, another stampede left an estimated 258 to 265 dead in the state of Maharashtra.Zach Scruggs, a lawyer for United States Senator Trent Lott, says that State Farm Insurance Company is destroying records related to claims for damage from Hurricane Katrina.The records allegedly contain information saying that State Farm fraudulently denied insurance claims made by its policy holders, including Lott, that had homes there were damaged or destroyed when Hurricane Katrina came ashore on the Gulf Coast.Scruggs said that Lott has "good faith belief" that many employees of the insurance company in Biloxi, Mississippi are destroying engineer's reports that were inconclusive as to whether or not water or wind was the main cause of damage to the buildings affected by the hurricane.Lott is among thousands of home and/or business owners who had their property damaged or destroyed during the hurricane and had their claims denied because State Farm claimed that their policies don't cover damage caused by floods or water that was driven by the wind.State Farm has not issued a statement on the matter so far.A state of emergency was declared in Greece after major wildfires started burning out of control on the northeast edges of Athens. Fire crews, aided by water-bombers and helicopters, have been dispatched to the affected areas to try to contain the fires.According to Greek authorities, the wildfires started late on Friday near Grammatiko, a village located 25 miles northeast of downtown Athens. The blazes, strengthened by heavy winds in the area, eventually reached neighbouring Varnava and Marathon on Saturday morning.Officials say that 70 fires broke out across the country since Friday night, according to the Associated Press. Fire department spokesman Yiannis Kapakis said that "this is a difficult fire because it is a mixed area with homes and forest, meaning that firefighters are focusing their attention on protecting lives and properties." He urged residents of the towns threatened by the fires to evacuate.Despite the state of emergency being called, no casualties have yet been reported as a result of the fires.The fires are reportedly the worst in mainland Greece since 2007.According to US health officials, New York state governor David Paterson has declared a state of emergency in the state as a result of the H1N1 swine flu outbreak.The Associated Press news agency reports that the six-page declaration was issued because at least 75 people have died of H1N1 related illnesses in New York since April.  Three have died from H1N1 related illnesses just this past week. The declaration also says that human cases of the virus are on the rise.Paterson says he issued the declaration because "a disaster has occurred throughout New York State, for which the affected local governments are unable to respond adequately."The declaration will allow health officials more access to the H1N1 vaccine and the seasonal flu shot. It will also allow for an increase in the number of vaccine doses available in the state and will allow more health care facilities to administer the vaccine, including dentists and pharmacists. Schools with health centers will also be allowed to administer both vaccines.Despite the declaration, officials stressed that there is no reason to worry. A spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Health, Claire Pospisil, said that "it [the declaration] helps us to be more prepared."The order came shortly after US president Barack Obama declared a national emergency last Saturday, a response to the spreading of the virus, which has now been circulated in 46 states.A bus operated by Viazul, which is run by the Cuban military's tourist section, crashed on Thursday between Baracoa and Guantanamo. It was carrying a mix of locals and foreigners from Baracoa to Havana. The crash reportedly killed seven.The bus overturned in wet conditions; the bus driver told reporters he lost control, with some local press claiming he was attempting to pass another vehicle. The front-left section of the vehicle was heavily damaged in the rollover. At least one seat was pictured lying beside the wreck. According to reports, of the 40 passengers, 22 were Cuban. Foreign nationals were from France, Mexico, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Four of the deceased were from overseas; they were two Argentinians, one from France, and a fourth from Germany.The crash took place on a bendy road at around 15:00 local time. Cuban roads suffer a large number of accidents; 2018 saw 11,187 recorded accidents leading to 750 deaths and 7,999 injuries. Sky News said Thursday's accident was the fourth major bus crash in a month. In addition to the deaths, 33 were reported hopitalised with five seriously injured.Following an accidental death at the closed Underwater World Singapore (UWS) aquarium in Sentosa on Tuesday, operations to relocate the facility's animals have been suspended.Phillip Chan, 62, the head diver of the defunct facility, was moving stingrays in preparation for transfer to another aquarium when one of them stung him in the chest. Singapore newspaper The New Paper reported no prior such stingray incident was known to have occurred in Singapore. Australian conservationist Steve Irwin died in a similar manner in 2006.Following a call to the Singapore Civil Defense Force at 2:20 pm, Chan was found near the entrance of UWS, where attempts were made to resuscitate him via CPR. He was taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he died from his injuries. While Chan's colleagues declined to comment to The New Paper, a staff member at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa, who witnessed Chan being taken away by ambulance, stated, "It all happened very quickly. The ambulance came and quickly left the premises. I've never seen such an incident happening here before." UWS operator Haw Par Corporation described Chan as a "veteran diver, aquarist and animal caregiver who had been caring for the aquatic animals at UWS since its opening in 1991". Ten staff, including Chan, remained at UWS after its closure on June 27 to facilitate care for its animals until they could be suitably relocated. In addition to assisting the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) Occupational Safety and Health Inspectorate with their investigations, Haw Par has pledged Chan's family "all possible support and assistance". Due to Chan's death, MOM has ordered the cessation of animal transfers from UWS while investigations are pending.In an interview with The New Paper, Dr. Tan Heok Hui, an ichthyologist and Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum operations officer, stated, "Stingrays attack when they feel threatened, cornered or alarmed. Sometimes, a stingray might feel threatened when someone accidentally steps on it. Stingrays have backward pointing barbs on the spine that have serrated edges. They don't just cause physical pain, the toxins in the spine can also cause extreme discomfort. When a spine pierces human flesh, it breaks and releases toxins into the flesh." Stingray venom contains serotonin, a neurotransmitter that can induce severe muscle contractions. According to Dr Tan, "If a victim is hit in vital organs like the chest area, it may trigger a cardiac arrest, which could subsequently be fatal". "Stingrays are not usually aggressive, and choose defensive methods to protect themselves. However, stingrays are still wild animals, and when provoked and left with no choice, they will defend themselves using their sting."In an interview with The New Paper at the time of UWS' closure in June, Chan said of the animals he worked with, whom he described as his "band of friends", "They are so quietly tame. [...] We intend to find them the best homes and environment. The next time I see them, I might not recognise them any more but if I dive, they might recognise me." Chan's work at UWS entailed diving into the tanks and feeding the animals whilst visitors took photos. In an interview at the time with The Straits Times, Chan stated, "I treat [the animals] like my babies." Chan also related anecdotes where he was bitten by sharks who mistook him for fish, releasing him when they recognised their mistake, describing the animals as "gentle". "Whenever I get in danger," said Chan, "I just keep calm. I can overcome any danger by just being calm".MOM stated of Chan's death, "The Ministry of Manpower was informed about an incident that took place at Underwater World Singapore Pte Ltd’s premises at Siloso Road on 4 October 2016. Officers from MOM's Occupational Safety and Health Inspectorate responded to the scene immediately and commenced investigations. Preliminary findings indicate that a worker was pierced in his chest by the barb of a stingray while he was in the midst of transferring the stingray from its tank. He was conveyed to hospital where he subsequently succumbed to this injuries. MOM has instructed the occupier to stop all activities associated with the transferring of sea animals. Investigations are ongoing."On Friday, a storm caused a building to partially collapse in the Amazon Fulfillment Center at the warehouse of Amazon.com, a US-based online retailer, in south-east Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The storm removed the roof of the building, causing a 50 foot (about 15 m) concrete wall 8 inches (about 20 cm) thick to collapse. At least two people died, and as of Saturday one person reportedly remained missing.Meg McNamara from the National Weather Service tweeted that the severe weather included two EF-1 tornadoes.  The weather service said the tornadoes touched down at 8:20 p.m. and 9:42 p.m. local time, the second in Baltimore City impacting the Amazon warehouse.On Saturday, the Baltimore Fire Department said in a tweet that they identified the victims as Israel Espana Argote and 54-year-old Andrew Lindsay. The Fire Department had conducted a search and rescue operation for bodies in the debris, involving heavy equipment.Five people have now died from the storms that hit the United Kingdom today and yesterday. One of the dead was a 27-year-old man from Stroud. He died while working in a construction site. A trench he was working in collapsed, with his death being caused by the five tonnes of soil that buried him. He was pronounced dead on the scene.A motorcyclist was killed yesterday when crashing into a tree off the A66 due to the heavy gales.A seventeen year old was killed after the vehicle she was traveling in was overturned. She was traveling with two others, who are currently still alive. Inspector Robert Price of Dyfed-Powys Police described the incident. "A 4x4 overturned and came to rest in a river. Three people have been airlifted to Bronglais Hospital, Aberystwyth, two of them suffering from hypothermia. One casualty tragically died following arrival at the hospital." Two other people were also killed for different reasons.The United Kingdom's government weather agency, the Met Office, yesterday put much of the UK on flood alert with severe weather warnings for the majority of England and Wales and much of Northern Ireland.The office said that a total of ten regions have a greater than eighty percent chance of "severe or extreme weather." These regions were Southwest Scotland, Lothian and Borders, Northern Ireland, Wales, Northwest England, Northeast England, Yorkshire and Humber, the West Midlands, the East Midlands, Southwest England and London and Southeast England.Fierce rain and heavy flooding forced the evacuation of houses across the Bay of Plenty in northern New Zealand last Wednesday.The town of Matata was particularly badly hit, with almost half the population evacuated. Twenty houses were destroyed, and over fifty others were extensively damaged. Total damage is estimated at several million New Zealand dollars.The nearby large town of Whakatane and city of Tauranga also suffered damage, with eight houses in Tauranga destroyed in a major landslip triggered by the rainstorm.Early media reports got it wrong in the case of a New Mexico man's house that burnt down after he tried to destroy a mouse he caught by burning it in a trash fire behind his home.The wacky story was picked up by news agencies reporting that the burning mouse escaped the fire and scurried back into the home of Luciano Mares, aged 81, of Fort Sumner. The mouse allegedly caused a window curtain to ignite, and the fire spread to engulf the entire home. Mares later indicated this was untrue.  However, the bonfire did spread to the wooden house, which was completely destroyed as a result, according to local fire officials.The Interfax news agency is reporting that a Russian minisub that was stranded underwater in the Pacific Ocean is trapped by two 60 tonne anchors.The submarine propeller has snagged on the antenna of a sonar underwater coastal defense station, (or perhaps very long low frequency arrays, which can be thousands of yards) 623 ft below the ocean 43 miles off Kamchatka.  "The anchor needs to be blown up" in order to be able to raise the AS-28 submarine, the commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet told Interfax."If the explosion is successful, the system will be raised to a depth of 100 meters and lit up by the Tiger [television camera], and we can at last be 100% sure that it's the submarine, and deepwater divers will be able to continue work," he continued.The AS-28 submarine, with seven crew onboard, became entangled on Thursday while at a depth of 190 m.Earlier reports that the submarine had been taken under tow have been proved false. Ships had attempted to trawl for the submarine in order to drag it into shallower water, but it is reported that they failed to capture the submarine.The Pacific Fleet commander says that the crew have enough food and water to survive until Monday although oxygen will run out by Saturday. The three-man submarine was designed to supply the crew with a five day supply of oxygen, however with the seven man crew the supply has been greatly depleted.Around ten Russian navy ships are attending, to be joined by four Japanese vessels on Monday. The US and UK navies are also flying in specialist rescue equipment, including two U.S. navy owned remotely-operated underwater robots capable of cutting through steel lines up to 1" thick and one U.K. video array ROV. They will arrive on Saturday.The crew have been using an underwater acoustic telephone to communicate with the surface, and are reported to be remaining calm. They have been told to keep still and to conserve the ship's power supplies.The same class of vessel, which measures 13.5 m by 3.8 m, was used during the ill-fated rescue attempt on the Kursk, which was lost with all hands almost exactly five years ago.Numerous city, state, and federal agencies are involved in the investigation of a recent string of church fires this past weekend in the city of Greenville, North Carolina, U.S.A.A police spokesman said two Baptist churches were believed to be set on fire and a third was broken into this past weekend. Damages are estimated to be over US$1,000,000.City of Greenville Police, Greenville Fire Department, North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are a part of a joint task force set up to investigate these incidents.Evidence from the fire scenes have been sent to the state crime lab for analysis.A US$10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest of the perpetrators of this crime.According to the United States Geological Survey, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake has been recorded in northern Sumatra, Indonesia at 3:02 p.m. local time [08:02 (UTC)].The epicenter was approximately 83 kilometers [51 miles] WSW of Banda Aceh, Sumatra, at a depth of 30 kilometers [18.6 miles].There are no reports of damages, injuries or deaths, according to the Jakarta geophysics agency, but the USGS does report that there is a potential for "light to moderate damage" on the northwest end of the island. No tsunami warning has been issued, and according to the Jakarta geophysics agency, no tsunami warning will be issued because the quake did not meet the magnitude 6.5 requirement. Despite there being no tsunami threat, residents started to panic and began to leave their businesses and homes.In 2004, a massive tsunami struck the island after a magnitude 9.2 quake rattled the region killing over 200,000 people.According to the USGS, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake has struck in the New Ireland region of Papua New Guinea. The time of the quake was reported at 5:12 p.m. local time [7:12 a.m. UTC]. The epicenter was 120 kilometers [74 miles] south, south east from Kavieng, New Ireland, in Papua New Guinea and had a depth of 410.4 kilometers [255.0 miles].So far there are no reports of damage or injuries from the quake. No tsunami warning has been issued.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), an earthquake with magnitude of 6.5 has struck China. Xinhua, one of China's main news agencies, reports the quake at a magnitude of 6.3.According to the USGS, the quake was centered 55 kilometers (35 miles) East, Southeast of Da Qaidam, Qinghai province and was reported at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles). It struck at approximately 9:22 a.m local time on Monday morning. Although there have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries, the USGS says damage in the area could be "very heavy". The shaking was felt as far away as Golmud, and Xining, where witnesses say buildings shook, but there was no damage.  This is adjacent to Tibet Autonomous Region and just at the foothills of Tibetan Plateau.The Da Qaidam region is an area of China where there are several launch sites for DF-4 nuclear missiles. At least two nuclear missiles are reported to be stored in the Da Qaidam Basin and were deployed there in 1998. Da Qaidam is one of five locations throughout China where launch sites exist. There is no word if the sites suffered any damage from the quake.A "sudden" and "terrifying" aftershock of the magnitude 8.8, February 27 earthquake hit central and southern Chile on Wednesday night. The aftershock, as reported by the Servicio Sismológico de la Universidad de Chile (University of Chile Seismological Service), had a magnitude of 5.8, and occurred at a depth of 32.6 kilometers (20.3 miles). It took place at 23:49:56 local time (Thursday 02:49:56 UTC). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said it occurred at a depth of 7 km (4.4 miles).Universidad de Chile measurements placed the center of the earthquake under the Pacific Ocean, 153 km (96 miles) northwest of the coastal town of Constitución.Diego Grez, a Wikinews reporter in Pichilemu, said, "It occurred very suddenly, and I felt the earth was moving like in circles." The coastal city of Pichilemu is about 150 km (about 90 miles) from the center of Wednesday night's earthquake.The USGS reported it occurred off the coast of the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region coast, 206 km (128 miles) west-northwest of Talca; 244 kilometers (151 miles) north-northwest of Concepción; 263 km (164 miles) southwest of Valparaíso; and 313 km (195 miles) west-southwest of Santiago, the capital of the country.As reported by ONEMI, Chile's National Emergencies Office, the aftershock was felt throughout the Valparaíso (Mercalli III), Santiago Metropolitan (II, III, IV), O'Higgins (IV), Maule (III, IV, V), Bío Bío (II, III, IV) and La Araucanía regions (II, III), including cities such as Santiago, Viña del Mar, Lolol, {{w|Santa Cruz, Chile|Santa Cruz]], Curicó, Cauquenes, Chillán, and Temuco. No damage or casualties were reported, and there was no disturbance to utilities.Grez said of Wednesday's midnight tremor, "I could see my sister coming down from the second floor of my house, she was very frightened. There are some small bells in the entrance of my house, and they were sounding very loud. It was terrifying, I just couldn't move."There were at least five following aftershocks, according to La Nación. The strongest one, a magnitude 4.1, occurred on land, at 06:44 local time (09:44 UTC); it was centered 66 km (41 miles) southeast of Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region and was felt stronger in Talca. A further aftershock, of magnitude 2.6, occurred 15 km (9.3 mi) southwest of Pichilemu, at 02:41 local time (05:41 UTC).The United States Geological Survey announced that a magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck near the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu.The earthquake occurred at 22:18:55 UTC on August 7, only 75 km (50 miles) east-southeast of Luganville, or 215 km (135 miles) north-northwest of the nation's capital, Port-Vila. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a bulletin, saying the earthquake was of magnitude 7.0, but did not expect a widespread tsunami.An earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale hit Pakistan on Thursday at  23.44 local time (+18.44 UTC). The epicentre was in the Hindukush mountain range. The earthquake was mainly felt in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Muzaffarabad, Lahore, and Faisalabad.The quake lasted approximately for twenty seconds. Many people rushed out of buildings, fearing that they would collapse, but no damage from the tremors was reported.As the epicentre of the quake was deep in the mountains, along the border with Afghanistan, not much damage was caused. This is the second time that the region was hit by earthquake with an epicenter in the same region of Hindukush.Last week, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck near the Afghanistan-Pakistani border.The strongest earthquake (7.6) that South Asia experienced in the last century caused widespread damage across Pakistan, North India, and Afghanistan this morning. Strongest hit was apparently Kashmir. Tens of thousands of people are feared dead. The epicenter was close to Muzaffarabad, 138 km to the north of Islamabad, and also caused severe damage from both shaking and from landslides to Balakot, Garhi Habibullah and one village in Rawalakot. Reports on fatalities are conflicting, but even the most conservative estimates put the toll as high as 20,000. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf told the BBC he knew of 20,000 people that were killed but added: "I wouldn't be able to make an accurate assessment for days." He also asked for international help and specifically requested large cargo helicopters to supply remote areas. The US has come forward to assist by providing eight military helicopters. The communications minister for the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, Tariq Mahmmod, said on Sunday, that "more than 30,000" died in his region alone. Aside from Kashmir most of the deaths occurred in the North-West Province of Pakistan and other northern areas. The estimated death toll has now reached 35,000.Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, a spokesman for Musharraf, said the scale of the devastation was the biggest Pakistan has ever seen. As emergency workers searched for trapped people and helped the injured, an international relief and recovery effort geared up.A U.N. disaster relief team was due in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, on Sunday. Britain, Germany, and the United States were among countries offering aid. India, Pakistan's neighbour and longtime rival, also offered aid (details). A British team from the International Rescue Corps was assisting in the operation at Marghalla Towers on Sunday, equipped with heat-seeking detectors, portable oxygen bags, and advanced slab and metal cutters. According to Pakistan Television this meant that "rescue efforts are picking up pace, and lot of time is being saved."The tremors began at 8:50 am (03:50 GMT), and continued for two minutes, followed by several aftershocks over a period of ten minutes. Initial reports said that they were felt in Delhi, Islamabad, Lahore, Quetta, Kabul, Punjab, Jammu, Kashmir, and other areas. A magnitude 6.3 aftershock occurred seven hours later just to the northwest.The earthquake caused several apartment buildings in Islamabad to collapse, trapping hundreds of people.250 children were killed in Gari Habi Ullaha between Mansehra and Muzaffarabad when their school collapsed.The Pakistani Interior Ministry reports that several villages were "wiped out." Pakistan's army has been directed to extend all out help to the civil population in the quake-hit areas. All civil and military hospitals have been directed to deal with the situation on an emergency basis. The President and the Prime Minister have appealed to the nation to stay calm in the face of the calamity, and asked the authorities concerned to carry out an immediate assessment of the extent of the damage.The Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz talked by telephone with authorities in four provinces and Azad Kashmir.  He directed them to utilize all machinery, and make all possible efforts to help the victims. He said that the whole federal administration, civil and military authorities had been alerted and relief goods had been provided to them for the victims of the quake.Most of the roads are closed in the Northern Sector near the earthquake, and some have been completely washed out, so the Pakistani army is flying supplies in by helicopter. Telephone and electricity connections have been cut to towns such as Muzaffarabad, making logistical operations much more complex. The heavy rains have also contributed to the suffering of the many thousands who are now homeless.Across the line of control in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, officials said Saturday that more than 465 people, at least 34 of them soldiers, were killed in the quake.Worst hit in India was the town of Uri, close to the border with Pakistan, where four in five of the town's buildings were leveled, and at least 120 people lost their lives. Officials in India have been criticised for the slow pace and lack of organisation in the relief effort[1].Magnitude: 7.6Region: North India, Pakistan, AfghanistanTime: (UTC) Sat Oct 8 03:50:38 2005 (08:50:38 local time)Epicentre: 80km (50 miles) north-east of Islamabad, PakistanTwo earthquakes, measuring 6.3 and 6.0 on the Richter scale struck the Indonesian island of Sumatra within the space of two hours, killing at-least 70 people. The death toll may rise as a large number of buildings were destroyed and the search for survivors continues.No tsunami warning was issued, although some people in coastal areas moved inland.  However, as the quake was under land there was no likelihood of a tsunami.The tremors were felt in Singapore and Malaysia as well.A magnitude 8.1 undersea earthquake triggered a tsunami that has killed at least fifteen people, including six children, in the Solomon Islands. Tsunami warnings have been issued for parts of Australia as well. According to the US Geological Survey, the magnitude 8.0 quake struck Sunday, April 1, 2007 at 20:39:56 (UTC) about 45 km (25 mi) south-southeast of Gizo, New Georgia Islands, Solomon Islands, at a depth of 10 km.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a powerful magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Indonesia's main island, Java, at 5:05 p.m. UTC, which is just after midnight locally.The epicenter was located 100 kilometers (65 miles) east of Jakarta and was at a depth of 289.2 km (179.7 miles). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that no tsunami is expected as the depth of the quake exceeded 280 km.There are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths."No reports of damage or casualties have been received at this time. Because this earthquake is located about 290 km below the surface of the earth, it will have been felt strongly over a wide area, but is not likely to cause severe damage. We have received reports that the earthquake was felt in much of Java and in parts of Malaysia", said a statement posted on the USGS website.An earthquake, measured at 6.7 on the Richter scale, has struck north-eastern Afghanistan.  The US Geological Survey (USGS) has stated that the time of the quake was 22:00 GMT, and the epicenter was close to the border with Pakistan.The tremor was felt in Delhi, Muzaffarabad, and Balakot.  It is the second quake to hit the area in a fortnight.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a strong magnitude 6.9 earthquake has struck Indonesia in the Molucca Sea approximately 220 kilometers (135 miles) north of Ternate, Maluku Islands, Indonesia at a depth of 44.6 kilometers (27.7 miles).The Japan Meteorological Agency reports the quake at a magnitude 7.0 with a depth of 50 km.An unnamed official with the USGS says "there is a potential that a tsunami might develop, judging from the magnitude," but no tsunamis were reported."We have lifted the warning. After monitoring, there were no signs of tsunami," said the Indonesian head of the country's geology agency, Fauzi. Initially, Fauzi issued a tsunami warning saying "we have issued a warning that the quake could potentially trigger a tsunami."There are no reports of injuries, deaths or damage. One resident in Ternate said that he "felt a strong tremor for almost a minute, people ran in panic from buildings. Children are crying and their mothers are screaming but there is no damage in my area."Earlier the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had issued a tsunami bulletin stating that local high waves could be possible, but a widespread tsunami is "not expected based on historical earthquake data."A strong earthquake struck off the southern tip of Taiwan at 12:26 UTC, triggering a warning from Japan's Meteorological Agency that a 3.3 foot tsunami could be heading towards Basco, in the Philippines.  The head of the earthquake monitoring agency in the Philippines disputed the Japanese agency's warnings, however.Conflicting reports have placed the magnitude of the quake between 6.7 and 7.2 on the Richter Scale, with the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau marking it at 6.7, the United States Geological Survey estimating it at 7.1, and the Japan Meteorological Agency putting the magnitude at 7.2.Despite the Japanese Meteorological Agency's warning of a tsunami threat to the Philippines, Renato Solidum, the director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, denied that a tsunami is headed towards the Philippines, saying that the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii had not released any tsunami advisory.  Nevertheless, Solidum said that residents in low-lying areas in the Philippines should, as a precaution, move to higher ground.In the aftermath of the quake, news agencies have aired reports of collapsed houses, hotel guests being trapped in elevators, and telephone outages due to severed lines across Taiwan. Two people were reported killed and 42 injured.The earthquake has damaged six submarine fiber-optic communications cables, restricting internet access to millions of users in Asia and Australia.Home users are experiencing severe connection issues, with timeouts becoming very common. The Internet Storm Center is reporting a 100% packet loss on certain routers. A sample ping test from Singapore to Wikinews came up with a 380 millisecond average round trip at 50% packet loss.The financial markets are facing an even more alarming situation, with financial news and stock quotes from the U.S. and Europe not being able to reach Asian markets.Repairing the lines "is not a matter of days," says Hong Seoung-Yong, a ministry official from South Korea handling the problem. Taiwan's internet capacity has dropped to 40%, and consequently the networks there are jammed. Service providers may choose to bypass those lines in favour of European ones, say a spokesman for Japanese telecoms firm KDDI Corp, Satoru Ito.The quake took place exactly two years from the day that the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake struck, devastating Southeast Asia. That 2004 earthquake registered as a magnitude 9.1, and caused a tsunami with waves reaching as high as 33 feet.A strong earthquake with magnitude 6.2 hit southwestern Iceland at 15:46 UTC. The epicenter was located 45 kilometers (30 miles) from the nation's capital, Reykjavik.At least 30 people are reported to have been injured, but so far there are no reports of deaths. Some buildings along the main road leading to the town of Selfoss suffered minor damage, leading to the closure of the road. Almost 6,400 people live in the town."People are mostly shocked and scared but no one is seriously injured so far," said Soffia Sigurdardottir, a rescue worker assisting those in need of help. "Everything was shaking. The glass in the windows shook and everybody was just really scared," said Audbjorg Olafsdottir, an economist in Reykjavik.Over 300,000 people live in Iceland. In June of 2000, a magnitude 6.6 quake struck the nation, which had been the country's first major earthquake in 88 years.According to the USGS numerous earthquakes ranging from magnitudes 5.1 to 6.1 have been reported off the western coast of Japan, prompting tsunami warnings to be issued. The warnings were lifted a short time later.The first quake, a 6.0 magnitude, was reported at 9:26 a.m. local time (00:26 UTC), 165 km (105 miles) north, north east of Ishigaki-jima, in the Ryukyu Islands in Japan.The second quake of 5.6 magnitude struck just five minutes after the first and a 6.1 magnitude quake struck just over an hour later, followed by a magnitude 5.9 about 15 minutes later.Japan's weather agency says the first and last quakes were actually 6.7 magnitude.Three smaller quakes ranging from 5.1 to 5.3 magnitudes shortly followed.The tsunami warnings were issued only after Japan's weather agency said that an 18-inch (46cm) wave could be a possibility.There are no reports of damage, injuries, deaths or tsunamis.The United States Geological Survey said a 6.1 Mw earthquake struck on Thursday, at 01:21:34 p.m. local time (6:21:34 p.m. UTC) in northern Costa Rica, a Central American country, 30 kilometres (19 mi) NNW of San José and near the volcano Poás. The epicenter was at 20 miles (32 kilometers) north-northwest of San Jose at a depth of 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers), with Coordinate 10° 11′ 49.2″ N, 84° 9′ 32.4″ W, and Decimal 10.197,-84.159. Causing widespread panic and damage, it was felt all over Costa Rica as well as in southern central Nicaragua, and was the strongest to shake Costa Rica in about 150 years. “Today is a day of mourning for Costa Ricans,” President Oscar Arias Sanchez said. “These losses of life fill us with pain; our prayers will be for their families, hundreds of families had seen serious damage to their homes,” Arias added. Originally seventeen people, including three children, were reported killed but was later decreased to 5 fatalities.  About 42 were reported missing, at least 32 were injured and 2,450 people affected. The quake toll jumped to 34 dead, 64 missing, on Saturday, while emergency workers rescued at least  200 stranded tourists in Varablanca hotel, according to Ministry of Infrastructure spokeswoman  Silvia Chaves.Amid problems of mudslides, cracked roads, tumbling rocks and fallen trees, National Social Security and Health agency, Red Cross rescue workers, firemen and police rushed Friday to evacuate about 600 people. Half of them were foreign tourists stranded in La Paz Waterfall Gardens eco-resort in Vara Blanca, and others were trapped by boulders and earth, when mountain roads in Costa Rica blocked two villages of Vara Blanca and Cinchona. The main CNE warehouse containing relief items (food, mattresses), for distribution to the victims, was burned, while the second airport in San Jose, is now closed. Most of the victims died when part of the hillside collapsed and a landslide occurred near the La Paz waterfall at Vara Blanca, on the flanks of the volcano Poás. The Poas Volcano National Park was utterly destroyed and the La Paz waterfall road was torn, causing about 300 tourists trapped. At least 400 people were evacuated from the area in rescue helicopters. Constant 2,000 aftershocks (1,200 through early Friday in the towns of San Pedro de Poas and Vara Blanca), complicated the rescue and emergency missions for stranded people in mountainous central zones. National Emergency Commission official Victor Falla said that there were small tremors every couple of minutes. "It's shaking right now," he added. 1,244 people were displaced, and 1,078 people are living in shelters. In addition, a hotel, houses, roads, and vehicles were damaged, and a couple of bridges were destroyed. The town of Cinchona was heavily hit, and all of the buildings there were heavily damaged. Power was temporarily disrupted in San José. "There are many buses and many vehicles that are trapped," deputy public safety minister Jose Torres said.In the central valley, populated by 2.5 million of the country's four million inhabitants, the National Emergency Board declared an emergency in the metropolitan area including San Jose, Cartago, Alajuela and Heredia. The earthquake hit strongest the remote area near Alajuela. Several homes collapsed and major highways were still blocked. A team of 34 U.S. military personnel and four Black Hawk helicopters from Honduras-based Joint Task Force-Bravo was sent on Friday by the U.S. Government to assist Costa Rican rescue workers, which include 400 volunteers and Red Cross personnel, who were dispensing aid in 15 communities. Colombia and China had also offered assistance to quake victims. The U.S. Army and Air Force aviation crews, rescue, medical and support personnel, is coordinating with the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) in the rescue efforts. At least 150 stranded tourists from the United States, France, Canada and Spain, were finally rescued on Friday.Indian Ocean - The death toll continues to grow and millions face a homeless life in the new year as coastal communities in south Asia struggle against continued aftershocks and flooding caused by the largest earthquake to strike the planet in more than a generation.The magnitude 9.0 undersea megathrust earthquake struck off the western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia on December 26, 2004, at 00:58:50 UTC (or 07:58:50 local time in Jakarta and Bangkok).The earthquake was the strongest in the world since the 9.2-magnitude Good Friday Earthquake which struck Alaska, USA in 1964, and the fourth largest since 1900. More than 140,000 deaths[1] were caused by resulting tsunami, which in Thailand were up to 10 meters (33 feet) tall, and struck within three hours of the initial event.Multiple tsunamis struck and ravaged coastal regions all over the Indian Ocean, devastating regions including the Indonesian province of Aceh, the coast of Sri Lanka, coastal areas of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the resort island of Phuket, Thailand, and even as far away as Somalia, 4,100 km (2,500 mi) west of the epicenter.While the earthquake and the tsunamis are no longer ongoing (other than aftershocks), the humanitarian and economic crisis generated by the disaster is still ongoing. This report will attempt to cover the crisis as it continues to develop.Shane Halligan, a 16-year old student in 11th grade, is dead after he shot himself once with an AK-47 at Springfield High School located north of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Police searched the grounds for possible explosives and say a bag carried by the shooter tested positive for traces of explosives.Halligan walked into the school and began to fire shots from his rifle into a hallway ceiling then shot himself according to the Springfield Township Police Chief, Randall Hummel. No other injuries to students occurred and all students were safely evacuated to a middle school not far from the location of the shooting."[He died of an] apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound," said Hummel. Authorities located a suicide letter in Halligan's pocket, but have not released its contentsThe school does not have metal detectors, but according to Roseanne Nyiri, the superintendent of the high school, security at the school will "now be reviewed." Security cameras are on school grounds and police say they have video of the boy firing the gun into the hallway ceiling."We're all very much aware that even metal detectors have not deterred students from bringing guns into schools in the past," added Hummel.According to Michael Delaurentis, 18 a witness and senior attending the school, the student was a "nice kid" and Delaurentis's father, also named Michael, described the student's family as "wonderful." "It just makes you a little in fear of the future, and not just at this school, any school, because I don't think any school is 100 percent secure," said Delaurentis's father."I was walking to my class. I just hear 'Get down.' I heard shots fired into the ceiling and I saw smoke," said Delaurentis.According to police reports, Halligan committed suicide because of his parents threatening to cut back on his after school activities due to poor performance in school. According to Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce L. Castor Jr., "The picture that's emerging is he was despondent over (the fact) that his grades were down, his parents were taking appropriate steps to limit extracurricular activities to get the grades up, and he saw the things that he felt were important in his life being taken from him."   but this is not the first time a weapon was brought onto school grounds.Back in September, at the same school, a student brought a gun to show-off to other fellow students causing the entire school to be locked down.A 19-year-old male student, who is now identified as Mark David Uhl, of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, was arrested after authorities were notified from a family member that he had packed his car trunk with home made bombs, and was planning to attend funeral services of the late Reverend Jerry Falwell who passed away on Tuesday last week.A family member called police at approximately 11:00 p.m. [local time] on Monday evening saying that Uhl "mentioned some explosive devices he had made."The funeral services for Falwell were held at the Thomas Road Baptist Church, the first church Falwell founded, at age 22. It was attended by mourners numbering 6,000 in a chapel that exceeded its capacity to host all who came to attend. More room was made for a people who attended the funeral at the university's basketball arena and football stadium.Police do not believe that Uhl was going to target the funeral directly. Instead they believe he was going to target protesters of Falwell who were going to attend the funeral. The group is known as the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church and believed that Falwell befriended homosexuals, despite the fact that Falwell was against homosexuality."I do not believe it was their intent to disrupt the funeral service. We do not believe the Falwells were ever in any danger," said Terry Gaddy, the Sheriff for Campbell County, Virginia who also said the bombs looked like "napalm" and were about "the size of soda cans." Gaddy also said there were at least five bombs. Maj. Steve Hutcherson, who is also affiliated with the Campbell County Sheriff said "what appeared to be about six explosive devices" were found and that the "canisters were filled with liquid."Several students from the high school Uhl attended, who are believed to have helped make the bombs, are also being questioned by authorities. They are all believed to have been in the same Reserve Officer Training Corps class at Liberty University.San Fernando, Chile — Ten students from the Liceo María Luisa Bombal of Rancagua, O'Higgins Region were detained by the local police yesterday. Following their release, the students told the media they were required to remove their clothes at the police station.The students, seven men and three women, took control of the building of the school early yesterday morning in response to the long delay in re-construction of the liceo, following the earthquake of 2010. At around 08:00 local time (1200 UTC), Leonardo Fuentes, general secretary of the Municipal Educational Corporation of Rancagua, authorized the police to clear out the students.Student leader Jennifer Olivares told Diario VI Región the police "stripped off [their] clothes" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Al llegar a la comisaría nos desnudaron. upon their arrival at the police station, Comisaría de Rancagua, something which Lieutenant Colonel of Carabineros Iván Guajardo did not deny. However, police stated the students will be charged by the public prosecutor with robbing food from the school. "It's a bit illogical that they stripped off our clothes, with the knowledge that there were minors and without [us] being delinquents, but students who took the school peacefully" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Es un poco ilógico que nos desnuden habiendo menores de edad y no siendo delincuentes, sino estudiantes que estábamos en una toma que había sido pacífica, said Olivares. Ignacio Muñoz, former leader of the occupation of the Liceo María Luisa Bombal, told El Rancahuaso "the Mayor [Eduardo Soto] promised to begin the reconstruction works last summer, and it's August already and they don't even begin to take the debris outside" ((es))Spanish language: ‍El alcalde se comprometió a comenzar los trabajos de reconstrucción durante el verano de este año, y ya estamos en agosto y aún no comienzan ni moviendo los escombros del interior. Education Regional Secretary (Seremi de Educación) Pedro Larraín said the government "does not share" ((es))Spanish language: ‍No compartimos las tomas such actions, "because they harm education" ((es))Spanish language: ‍porque perjudican a la educación.The Region of Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins was one of the first in 2012 to resuscitate the previous year's student protests, more specifically at the Liceo Industrial de San Fernando, which was taken control by the students in late July, and which as of yesterday was still taken. The students of the Liceo Industrial were particularly affected, after the president of the school's centro de alumnos Guillermo Horta Farías was stabbed outside the educational establishment on July 31; his fellow schoolmates subsequently organized a march in his honour in Rancagua, on August 8. As of August 11, eight high schools have been taken control of by students, in response to the government's failure to satisfy the secondary and university students' requests.Dozens of students and teachers were stung by yellow jacket wasps Monday at a middle school in Cranston. The attack occurred around 10:45 a.m., according to Ray Votto, the chief operating officer for Cranston Public Schools.It is suspected that during a routine fire drill, students exiting the building disturbed the wasps' nest in a field behind the school. Votto said, "When kids exited towards the back of the school building near our portable classrooms, they walked into a field and may have disrupted a nest". The Cranston Fire Department and school nurses responded to the scene to provide medical assistance. A total of 25 students, one of whom was hospitalized, and four teachers were stung, some multiple times. All of the students and one teacher were sent home.Over two decades, on average every 22 minutes a child in the United States experiences an injury from a shopping cart-related accident that requires emergency room attention and this type of injury has increased significantly, according to a new study released this month by the journal Clinical Pediatrics.The number of shopping cart-related injuries to children increased over the course of the study period, which was between 1990 and 2011, and also increased since the United States first set safety standards in 2004. The study notes that an average of 66 children a day required emergency care as a result. According to the study, that is an estimated 24,000 children annually. The study looked at over a half a million cases over the two decades.Researchers also found that 70.4 percent of those injuries were from falls from the shopping carts. The study also documents the other ways children are commonly injured including collisions, cart tip overs, and trapped limbs. The most likely type of injury is a head injury and accounts for 78.1 percent of emergency care cases involving shopping carts.The study was carried out by Dr. Gary Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and his colleagues. Smith said the current voluntary standards for shopping cart safety are not adequate. "Not only have the overall number of child injuries associated with shopping carts not decreased since implementation of the safety standards, but the number of concussions and closed head injuries is actually increasing," he said. "It is time we take action to protect our children by strengthening shopping cart safety standards with requirements that will more effectively prevent tip-overs and falls from shopping carts." Shopping cart-related accidents happen to both young and old. Chris Strickland, 18, was working in a Home Depot in Anchorage, Alaska earlier this month when he saw a shopping cart falling over and in quick order stopped the cart with one hand and saved a baby with his other arm. And in Shanghai, China, a women died last year as a result of a runaway shopping cart.According to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, parents can follow several guidelines in order to reduce the danger of shopping cart-related accidents:Researchers belonging to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) say that the Arctic ice caps are melting at a rate much faster than that predicted by computer models previously reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and that the ice could be gone sometime near year 2020. "This suggests that current model projections may in fact provide a conservative estimate of future Arctic change, and that the summer Arctic sea ice may disappear considerably earlier than IPCC projections," said head researcher of the study group at the United States-based National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the University of Colorado's NSIDC, Julienne Stroeve.Stroeve says that the IPCC's 18 computer models used in the study were out of date and that the melting of the ice has actually progressed 30 years quicker than the computers predicted. The researchers also say that the computers did not take into account the increased threat of global warming. The IPCC ultimately predicted that the ice would be gone by 2050.Despite the predictions, since 1979, the ice has actually melted at a rate of 9% per decade.The prediction by the IPCC was done in the Arctic Sea during September and predicted that between 1953 and 2003, the ice would have melted 2.5% per decade, but it actually melted at a rate of 7.8% per decade. Their worst case scenario between those years, which was predicted using only one computer, had shown that the ice was going to melt at a rate of 5.4% per decade."Right now - the Arctic helps keep the Earth cool. Without that Arctic ice, or with much less of it, the Earth will warm much faster. The IPCC report was very careful, very thorough and cautious, so they erred on the side of what would certainly occur as opposed to what might occur," said Ted Scambos, an expert on Arctic ice in the U.S."Long-term and for the next 50 years, I think even the new report will agree that we're in for quite a bit of warming," added Scambos.Subway service in the United States capital city of Washington, D.C. was disrupted Sunday afternoon when a Washington Metro Green Line train derailed as it approached theMount Vernon Square station.Sixteen passengers were reported hospitalised, but no critical injuries were reported. All passengers were evacuated from the trains less than an hour after the incident. The Mount Vernon Square station remained closed for the remainder of Sunday, with shuttle bus service bypassing the accident scene. Travel for Green and Yellow line passengers was delayed by 20 minutes during clean up and accident investigation. Normal service on Metrorail resumed on Monday.John Garang, recently sworn in as Vice President of the Sudan, was confirmed dead after his helicopter disappeared yesterday. Sudanese state television initially reported him to be alive but it now appears Mr. Garang died after his helicopter crashed.Garang became Vice President in a historic deal, which ended the southern rebellion after 20 years of fighting. The deal created a government of national unity, giving hope to many that problems endemic to the region, including the Janjaweed militia in Darfur, could finally be solved and that the Muslim north could come to liveable terms with the Christian south.Garang was making an official trip to Uganda when bad weather struck; his helicopter had not arrived at its destination and was out of contact leading many to fear the worst.The BBC reports that "large-scale" rioting has broken out in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, with supporters of Mr. Garang battling armed police. Disturbances are also reported in the south of the country. Some southerners believe that the Sudanese authorities were behind the crash, according to USA Today, which draws parallels with the shooting down of a plane carrying Rwanda's President Habyarimana in 1994. Habyarimana's assassination helped trigger Rwanda's infamous genocide, recently portrayed in the movie "Hotel Rwanda". Garang's party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, has appealed for calm, insisting that his death was an accident.In a press release published on the website Allafrica.com, Uganda's President Museveni appeared to be keeping an open mind about the circumstances of the crash, which he says took place on the Ugandan-Sudanese border. "The helicopter was a recently overhauled executive helicopter that has served us well for the last 8 Years", he is quoted as saying, detailing a number of technical improvements recently made to the craft. In the same statement, Museveni announces the creation of a panel of experts to investigate the crash. "We have also approached a certain foreign government to rule out any form of sabotage or terrorism", he says.The three 100 foot reinforced concrete sugar storage silos around which the investigation into the 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion is centred have been demolished. The February industrial disaster killed 13 people when the Imperial Sugar refinery at Port Wentworth, United States exploded.The initial investigation concluded the disaster to have been a dust explosion that ignited under the silos, but investigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) have been hampered as OSHA declared them to be unsafe after the accident.A 7,000lb wrecking ball has now been brought in and demolished the structures, which were 18 inches thick. This will allow access for investigators, and make way for replacement silos and a new sugar packaging building, which are scheduled to be in place by Summer 2009. The refinery hopes to restart sugar processing by the end of the year.Imperial vice president Brian Harrison, who is overseeing reconstruction at the site, said of the move "Several people have indicated to me it's a passage from the old to the new and a significant sign of the progress we're making to rebuild."2.8 million pounds of fire-hardened sugar were still present in one silo, and 500,000 pounds in another. Imperial brought in a crane with a bucket to retrive this and intends to recycle it for ethanol production.Four workers are still hospitalised after the explosion, three in critical condition. The disaster is also blamed for a $15.5 million loss Imperial posted in this year's first quarter.A suicide bomber attacked the Chaklala airbase in the Punjab province of northern Pakistan this morning, killing at least four civilians and two air force personnel at a security checkpoint.The blast took place in Kamra, approximately 50 km (30 mi) away from Islamabad, near Rawalpindi and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC). The attacker had apparently hoped to enter the airbase, but detonated his explosives while at the checkpoint when officers suggested they wanted to search his clothing.With some outlets reporting as many as eight deaths, between nine and thirteen people were believed wounded, although their identities haven't been disclosed, said Fakhar Sultan, District Police chief.Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani condemned the suicide attack, and repeated that his government would not waver from its goal to "root out terrorism".This was the second time that Kamra was targeted, the first being in December 2007. International groups have suggested that Pakistan may keep its nuclear-armed aircraft at the base.A suicide bomber in Iskandariya, Iraq, a town just south of the county's capital Baghdad, blew himself up killing at least 40 people and injuring at least 60 others on Sunday February 24.Iraqi officials say that the bomber was wearing a vest and then blew himself up after entering a pilgrim 'comfort station' off a main road near where a religious fair is being held for Shia pilgrims. The station was providing items such as water and food to passing pilgrims.United States and Iraqi forces quickly re-established a safe-zone surrounding the pilgrimage fair."[We quickly] re-established a safe environment for the rest of the pilgrims as they continued to walk south," said 4th Brigade Commander of the U.S. military's 3rd Infantry Division, Col. Tom James.This was the second attack in one day believed to be targeting Shia Pilgrims. The first attack was in Doura a district of Baghdad. 49 people were injured and three others were killed when pilgrims passed over a roadside bomb which was followed by militant gunfire.Local police have reported that a suicide bomber has killed at least twenty people and injured a further thirteen after attacking a military convoy close to the tribal Orakzai region of northwestern Pakistan. The attack happened close to a checkpoint in the city of Kohat on Saturday.The incident occurred at 16:10 local time (10:10 GMT). "The bomber was driving a pick-up truck which he rammed into a convoy passing by a security checkpost," said senior police officer Fareed Khan. "At the moment, I can say at least 20 people, including soldiers and policemen, were killed." He added that two civilians and eighteen security personnel were among the killed, and the number of casualties would possible increase, as seven of those wounded were in critical condition.The explosion was powerful enough to have damaged ten vehicles of the army convoy, as well as a police van stationed near the post.Yousuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister of Pakistan, denounced the attack, describing it as "cowardly act of terrorism". He pledged that he would use an "iron hand" against insurgents.A spokesman for Baitullah Mehsud, the chief of the Taliban, said by telephone to news agencies that rebels will continue to attack the security forces. "It was retaliation for the US drone strikes and security forces will have to see more attacks because our people have suffered many losses in the missile attacks," the spokesman stated.Six people were killed and fifteen injured after a suicide bomber detonated a bomb inside a funeral tent in Iraq on Monday.The attack occurred in the city of Haditha, about 220 kilometres from Iraq's capital of Baghdad. The bomber had been carrying an explosive belt when he entered the tent and blew it up.The funeral had been held for a member of the tribe al-Jaghaifa, which consists primarily of members of Iraq's security forces and Sunni insurgency supporters.Haditha is a city in Iraq's Anbar Province. It used to be a haven for Sunni insurgents, but violence there later decreased after local tribes sided with US armed forces in the war against Al-Qaeda.Iraqi police have said that a suicide bomber killed at least 11 people in an attack on a mosque in northern Iraq on Friday.According to officials, at least 70 other people were wounded in the bombing, which took place during Friday prayers at a Sunni mosque in the northern town of Tal Afar. The bomber, who was described as being "tall", stood up while the cleric, Abdul-Satar Hassan, a member of an Iraqi Sunni political party, was giving a sermon. He then opened fire with a firearm.Several seconds later, he shouted "God is great!", and blew himself up with explosives attached to his person, according to a witness at the mosque.Tal Afar is located in the Nineveh province, near Mosul. Though Iraq has seen a decline in violence over the past year, attacks in that part of the country have continued.At least four people were killed by a suicide bomb in the Turkish city of Istanbul on Saturday morning. The suicide bomber was a fifth death.At least 36 people were injured, according to Turkish health minister Mehmet Müezzinoğlu.  Reports varied on how may injured were foreigners; Minister Müezzinoğlu identified the nationalities of twelve injured from Israel, Germany, Ireland, Iceland, Iran, and Dubai.The blast occurred prematurely, according to CNN Türk.The attack took place on Istiklal Street, a popular pedestrian commercial street. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called the blast "inhumane," saying Turkey would continue to fight "centres of terrorism". This is the third attack in Turkey in just over a month, following a car bomb that killed more than 30 people in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, six days earlier, and the bombing of a military convoy in mid-February.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey condemned the Ankara attack, saying, "Terror organisations and their pawns are targeting our innocent citizens in the most immoral and heartless way as they lose the fight against our security forces[...] Terror attacks — which intend to target the integrity of Turkey, unity and solidarity of our people — do not diminish our will to fight against terror, but further boost it."The Ankara attack has since been claimed by a Kurdish military group, the Kurdish Freedom Falcons: "We claim the operation of March 13, 2016, at 6:45 p.m. in the heart of the Republic of Turkey".The Kurdish Freedom Falcons are associated with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). According to Reuters, violence has escalated in southeast of Turkey since the July collapse of the Turkey–PKK ceasefire.A suicide bomber in a village in northwestern Pakistan has killed at least thirty people on Friday, according to a police official. Fifteen other people were wounded.The explosion occurred in Usterzai, near the town of Kohat. A two-story hotel and some vehicles near it were destroyed, and a nearby bazaar was also damaged.

The Al Jazeera news agency reports that seventy people were injured from the blast.According to Siddiq-ul-Farooq, a spokesman for the Pakistan Muslim League, the bomber drove his car into the wall of Dost Muhammad Khosa's home, damaging it. Khosa and his relatives, however, were not at home, Farooq added. The house was reportedly close to a market, which also suffered from the explosion.A reporter for Al Jazeera, however, noted that it wasn't immediately clear if Khosa was intended as a target in Tuesday's attack."There are many people trapped in the rubble after the powerful blast demolished some 10 shops [...] The rescue work is under way and we fear the toll may go up. It was a terrorist activity, similar to those being carried out in other parts of the country," said town commisioner Hasan Iqbal.A local resident, Raza Khan, was witness to the chaos that resulted after the detonation. "The whole market has collapsed. There is smoke and people running here and there," he said to the Associated Press.

Over fifty other people were injured in the explosion.Security officials say the bomber drove his vehicle into the convoy on the Jalalabad road, which is notorious for being the scene of frequent attacks by the Taleban."I saw wounded people and dead people everywhere," a shopkeeper named Sawad told the Reuters news agency. "I helped some people to ambulances, their clothes were covered in blood stains."Two Afghan staff from the United Nations are feared to be among the casualties from the attack. "I am shocked and greatly saddened to have learned that two of my staff members were among those killed in today's suicide bombing," said Kai Eide, the special representative for the UN.The violence comes before Thursday's presidential election, which militants have promised to disrupt. Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai has said the attacks wouldn't deter citizens from voting, who would cast their ballots "despite the efforts of the enemies and will show their opposition to their barbaric acts."Afghan police said today that a suicide bomber riding a motorcycle blew himself up in the southwestern part of the country today, killing at least sixteen people. Two children and one police officer were among the dead, and dozens of others were injured.Afghan officials say the suicide bomber targeted a busy area of the city of Farah, which is the capital of a province by the same name.

The convoy carried several people, vehicles filled with provisions and commodities for trading. A majority of the people in the group were Shia Muslims. No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. Several insurgents have attacked the country's North West Frontier Province in the last year. Earlier, three died in another suicide attack on a police station in Karak, located in the same area.Many Shi'as dwell in the Parachinar and Orakzai area which has been home to violence in the past. The Tall-Parachinar road was closed to the public in 2008 and 2009 due to Taliban activity. The latter targeted Shia Muslims, sources say. The road was re-opened about two months ago, with convoys guarded by security forces forming the bulk of the traffic.Hangu borders Pakistan's tribal regions, where several militant groups are believed to be operating. However, security forces say that arrangements have improved from the past.A suicide bombing near an airfield in Kandahar, Afghanistan earlier today has killed at least three people and injured a further 35, according to reports.According to a commander of southern Afghan armed forces, Sher Mohammed Zazai, the explosion hit the airfield as well as a compound giving logistical help to NATO troops.A correspondent for Al Jazeera in Kabul reports at least three suicide bombers were involved in the attack. The news agency also attributed the attack to the Taleban.This attack comes soon after the United Nations said it would be closing its Kandahar office temporarily due to concerns about security. At least twenty civilians, among them eight children, have been killed in attacks in Kandahar since April 12.Seven people were killed and 26 injured in the city of Kohat in northwestern Pakistan on Sunday after a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb near a police station, police officials said."It was a suicide attack, the target was a police station," Dilawar Khan Bangash, police chief of Kohat, told AFP news agency. He said that all those killed in the attack were civilians. The explosion occurred at the back of the police station."Seven people have been killed and 21 were injured in this car suicide attack," Abdullah Jan, another high ranking police official, told reporters. His statement was made soon after the attack, before the number of injured was revised upward.  "These incidents are a reaction to the military operation in the tribal areas," he claimed. Another police officer confirmed what Jan and Bangash had said, saying that approximately 200 kilograms of explosives were used.The station was badly affected by the attack, and three rooms of a government-run primary school were destroyed. Seven local shops were also severely damaged.This attack occurred a day after an earlier suicide bombing killed over 40 people near the same city, and two days after an attack in southern Pakistan killed upwards of ten people.The Philippine shipping company Sulpicio Lines has asked a court to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) stopping the Board of Marine Inquiry (BMI) from proceeding with its investigation into the loss of MV Princess of the Stars. The passenger ferry capsised and sank off Sibuyan island on June 21 during Typhoon Fengshen (known locally as Typhhon Frank) with hundreds of casualties.Sulpicio told the Manila Regional Trial Court that both Republic Act 9295 and the Domestic Shipping Development Act of 2004 removed the BMI's power to investigate maritime incidents and that the investigation the board launched on June 25 is "irregular, illegal, and null and void". They say only the Maritime Industry Authority is allowed to investigate accidents at sea.Sulpicio also described the investigation as an 'inquisition' that was biased against Sulpicio from the start. They say "prejudgment" has increased the "pervasive negative publicity" surrounding the line, since negative accusations are most often published in newspapers. The company says one comment the board made was "Your vessel is not stable!" "You have no business being a safety officer!"As a result Sulpicio is seeking ₱650,000 from the BMI. This is split down as ₱500,000 in moral damages, ₱100,000 lawyer's fees and ₱50,000 further costs.The House Committee on Transportation also launched its own inquiry into the disaster today. The case for the TRO will be heard tomorrow.Sulpicio Lines, a ferry company in the Philippines, have been ordered to pay PH₱6.24 million over the death of a man on board MV Princess of the Orient, which sank in stormy weather off Batangas in 1998. Ernesto Unabia was one of seventy confirmed fatalities in the disaster, which left eighty more missing.Unabia was a 37-year-old seaman who worked on international vessels, and earned a ₱120,000 salary. According to widow Verna Unabia, who filed the case with her three children, he was going to work on for thirteen more years and then retire. Unabia's case is the first to be concluded, although most victims settled with Sulpicio without claims being filed.Although Sulpicio lost their appeal several weeks ago, reporters have only today received access to documentation concerning the case.Under Philippines law, employers are responsible for their employees actions. However, in Pestaño vs. Sumayang the Supreme court ruled that if it could be proved an employer had taken appropriate diligence when selecting employers then they could not be held responsible.It was viewed that Sulpicio was responsible as they failed to remove captain Esrum Mahilum from the vessel despite a number of incidents involving the ferry while he was in command of it. Princess of the Orient had struck the bottom of Manila's North Harbour, sideswiped a container ship and suffered a crippling engine fire while berthed at North Harbour, being towed first to Cebu and ultimately Singapore for repairs.Despite these serious incidents while the ship was under Mahilum's care, however, he was not removed from captaincy or even disciplined. A Board of Marine Inquiry (BMI) investigation into the ultimate sinking of the Princess of the Orient would later say that Sulpicio did not have enough initiative to take action against him. The court ruled this made them responsible for his actions.On September 18, 1998, the day of the sinking, Captain Mahilum was warned before starting out that severe weather was approaching. He wrongly calculated that the storm was safely distanced and left port regardless, running into the storm two hours later. Princess of the Orient began listing to the left and a distress call was sent, but she sank before help arrived. The BMI's report blamed the disaster on the captain making "erroneous maneuvers of the vessel before it sank." He remains missing to this day.After the court ruled that this made Sulpicio liable to pay civil damages an appeal was filed, in which Sulpicio said that the captain "valiantly tried to save his ship up to the bitter end. He heroically went down with his ship." Although he failed to properly supervise the abandon ship order he gave, he was last seen helping passengers to board life rafts. Sulpicio further alleged that careful analysis of the BMI report showed he did not directly cause the disaster.The court rejected the appeal, with judge Estella Alma Singco saying that while the failure to remove the captain wasn't the direct cause, "such failure doubtless contributed materially to the loss of life." Sulpicio were ordered to pay P6.240 million in lost earnings, P100,000 moral damages, P50,000 indemnity - which Sulpicio had already offered to all the families of the deceased - and P50,000 in pursuer's litigation costs.Sulpicio Lines has named the companies hired to conduct salvage operations for MV Princess of the Stars, the Philippines ferry that sank on June 21 during Typhoon Fengshen, leaving over 800 passengers dead.The Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) had already set a deadline of this Tuesday to name the contractor who would recover the ship. Another important aspect is the separate recovery of chemicals on board, primarily the fuel and a 10-tonne shipment of the dangerous pesticide endosulfan by Del Monte.The ship had also been carrying a number of other chemicals in smaller quantities, including metamedopus, carbofuran, niclosemide, and proptineb. All of the chemicals must be removed by order of the DOTC before the vessel is recovered. The chemical recovery is to be performed by Titan Salvage, an international firm owned by Florida's Crowley Maritime Corporation and specialising in sunken and capsized ship recovery. Titan will co-operate with both Sulpicio and the DOTC, and expect the project to be completed within 60 days of the contract being signed.Once the chemicals on board are removed then the ship itself can be recovered. Sulpicio has also named its contractor for this: Malayan Towage and Salvage Corporation (Salvtug). Salvtug has accepted the contract, but warned that its estimated operation cost is PHP2.25 billion to P4.5 billion, which is roughly equivalent to US$50 million to $100 million. Sulpicio had previously estimated that this exercise would cost P600 million.The high cost is a potential problem as it is unclear who will pay. Sulpicio's insurance does not cover salvage. Had Sulpicio been covered with protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance this would have been covered, but this is not required in the Philippines and so Sulpicio's insurance agreement with Oriental Assurance Corporation only covered the hull, machinery and third-party injuries and damage.It is likely that Sulpicio will pay for the recovery of the ferry, which has a gross weight of 23,824 tons, but as the ship poses a potential environmental hazard it has been suggested that the government should pay the costs initially to ensure work is done quickly, with Sulpicio to be charged later for this. However, for now it is unclear who will pay for the vessel's recovery.Super Typhoon Haitang is now making landfall in Taiwan. Yesterday, Haitang was a Category 5 typhoon, with winds at 160 mph (257 km/h) and gusts up to 195 mph (317 km/h), and is currently moving west-northwest at 14 knots (16 mph, 26 km/h). As of 12:00 GMT on July 16, Haitang was located at 20.7° N, 127.7° E.Current Wind speeds are 140 mph, with gusts up to 165 mph , the typhoon is moving northwest at 13 mph. The Taiwan central weather bureau is expected to issue a sea warning later today and possibly a land warning tomorrow.Los Navegantes, Pichilemu, Chile — Paulina Constanza Tapia Figueroa, 25, a surfer native to Pichilemu, known worldwide as the "Surf Capital", died on Monday, at Punta de Lobos beach, about seven kilometers south of the city.Her body was discovered by fishermen in the area, who called Pichilemu Police officers, who along with Homicide Brigade of the Investigations Police of Chile (PDI) officers, arrived at the place and took the body to the Forensic Medical Service offices in San Fernando.Tapia had been practicing surfing for years, and earlier that day, had been accompanied with her friends. "A shellfish diver of the area noticed a surfboard floating, he approached it and saw that the girl [Tapia] was semisubmerged in the water. After taking her out, he realized she was dead," Juan Reyes, officer of the Homicide Brigade of PDI told Televisión Nacional de Chile.According to reports, Tapia either died because of a heart attack or after being hit. Third-party participation in her death was ruled out by officers."She had a free spirit, she loved nature, and I don't really know what happened to her, a cramp [maybe]," Filippo Tapia, her father, told La Tercera. Josefa Tapia, her 14-year-old sister who is studying at Colegio Preciosa Sangre, seemed very affected by her death after being informed of the situation by school inspectors."Your sister will always be watching out and protecting you from heaven, remember the moments you and your family lived with her ​​and that made ​​you happy," a friend of Josefa wrote on her Facebook wall.Photos, videos, and messages such as "Paulita, rest in peace with love, I'll miss you a lot, great waves and farewell forever," and "My friend, I know you are in a better place having a really good time, you're the best! I love you infinitely!" flooded Paulina Tapia's Facebook wall.Tapia's body remained in the Forensic Medical Service of San Fernando on Tuesday morning, according to reports. According to Domingo Osorio Figueroa, Paulina Tapia's remains have been veiled since Tuesday's afternoon in the dependencies of Funerales Rodríguez, in Rancagua, capital of O'Higgins Region. A mass will be performed in the Rancagua Sur Catholic Parish, at 11:30 local time (14:30 UTC) on Wednesday, and then she will be buried in Parque Jardín Las Flores, in Machalí.Wikinews  has learned that, in a surprising turn of events, the city of Buffalo located in New York, has ordered and begun an emergency demolition on a three story 19th century stable which partially collapsed on Wednesday June 11 causing at least five homes to be evacuated. Residents are not happy, and despite the short notice of the demolition, nearly 30 people showed up to protest it. Demolition was not supposed to begin until Monday June 16.At about 2:30 p.m. (eastern time) on June 13, demolition crew arrived at the stable located at 428 Jersey Avenue and began to unload heavy equipment which will be used to demolish the building. This came as a surprise to residents, as demolition was not supposed to start until Monday June 16.During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to scene after residents called 9-1-1 stating that part of the building had collapsed. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighboring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.At about 3:30 p.m. crews began to demolish a small portion of the stable located behind Joe Murray's home, a resident who lives behind a portion of the building on Jersey and Richmond avenues. While demolition was taking place, the section collapsed into Murray's backyard, prompting a call to police. Some residents who own home surrounding the building were inside Murray's house holding a neighborhood meeting when demolition began. No one was injured when the section collapsed."[The building] can come down any minute," stated Donna Berry of the Buffalo Police Department who also added that when police arrived on scene, they immediately put a stop to demolition, fearing the safety of surrounding residents and pedestrians."So many [of the] people [living around the building] are at risk, it makes me want to cry," added Berry.Police, local politicians and area residents are concerned that demolition crews and the city are not taking the proper precautions to ensure the safety of residents during demolition."[There is] no protection for neighbors. [This is] appalling and beyond negligence," stated Tim Tielman, Executive Director of the Campaign for Buffalo who was referring to the negligence of the demolition crew."[In order to stop demolition] citizens must demonstrate direct harm to themselves," added Tielman.The city's preservation board held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue. Wikinews has learned that the owner of the building, Bob Freudenheim, gave the city permission to demolish the building because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim was part-owner of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and was also an advocate to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. He also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.Tielman states that he was in contact with Freudenheim this morning. Tielman states that Freudenheim "is not spending a dime" to have the building renovated. Tielman states that Freudenheim has offered to sell the building to any interested party for only one US dollar, but that he "flip flops [his decision] constantly," sometimes wanting hundreds of thousands of dollars for the building. Wikinews has attempted to contact Freudenheim, but so far has been unsuccessful.City building inspectors were also on scene evaluating the building and ensuring the safety of residents. Donald Grezebielucina states that "some people are on notice to vacate their properties", but also stated that no other precautions were being taken other than placing "tires and scaffolding" onto the side of 430 Jersey, which sits less than eight feet from the buildings East side."The gas has been shut off in case we lost the building, so there would be no explosions or anything like that. It's so unstable, the structural integrity is gone. The chemical composite of the trusses has changed dramatically and dry rotted. There are  three vehicles in the basement which totally disappeared," stated Grezebielucina to the press while protesters yelled "save our building, save our neighborhood."Wikinews has also learned that local residents have consulted a lawyer regarding the issue, and hope to petition the New York State Supreme court to issue an injunction to stop demolition. They states that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished. Freudenheim is facing housing violations for neglecting the building. Though residents are fighting, Tielman states that "an injunction is unlikely.""We had a letter of violation against him. He was supposed to have started work to stabilize the brick this Monday. We all hope this building could be saved. But we've got five houses evacuated and we cannot tolerate any further delay. We've got to get people back into their homes in a safe condition," said Richard Tobe, Commissioner of the city's Permit and Inspection Services.Demolition is set to resume at 8:00 a.m.in the morning of Saturday June 14.Mike Lombardo, the Commissioner for the Buffalo Fire Department, believes that the building was built in 1812 or 1814, making it nearly 200 years old. It is one of only three stables still standing in the city.Monday marks the 99th anniversary of the "Great San Francisco Earthquake" of 1906. Survivors are becoming harder to find, but about a half-dozen of them gathered at Lotta's Fountain for a wreath-laying ceremony. Lotta's Fountain was the spot used after the earthquake as a collection point for information about victims, both family and friends.Organizers of today’s event believe they can bring about 60 survivors to next year's centennial.The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has agreed to change the original statistics of the quake, an estimate of 478 deaths. In time for the centennial, the officially reported number will be revised to account for the some 3 to 6 thousand people who died.An express train travelling from Moscow to St Petersburg in Russia derailed yesterday, leaving at least 25 people dead and 100 more wounded. Authorities suspect a terrorist attack after a possible bomb crater was found beside the line.The trainwreck occurred in the countryside of Tver, near Bologoye. Around 650 passengers were on board the Nevsky Express which was travelling during peak time along one of Russia's most-traversed rail routes. Ninety of the injured are hospitalised, with hundreds of rescue workers attending and three victims being airlifted by helicopter.Survivors say they heard a loud bang just before the crash. "There was an explosion under the locomotive," the driver said as he called the Emergencies Ministry from his mobile phone. "I do not know what we hit. We are derailed. The locomotive and carriages, I do not know yet what else, everything is in smoke."The prosecutor-general has launched a terrorism investigation. Vladimir Yakunin, head of state-owned Russian Railways, said the chief line of enquiry is "To put it simply, a terrorist attack." "There is objective evidence that ... a blast from an explosive device is one of the explanations for the Nevsky Express incident," he said.The Interfax agency reported the crater was a metre wide. Russian journalists reporting from the scene were unable to locate it. President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered a full investigation and assistance for the victims. The Health Ministry said that over a dozen people remain missing.Russian railway infrastructure is poorly maintained and plagued by negligence and alcohol abuse, according to The Guardian. There is also a high concern of terrorism, especially from rebels in Chechnya. Two Chechnyan rebels are accused of a 2007 bombing that derailed a train on the same line, wounding 27 people.Authorities are investigating what's left of debris believed to belong to a plane, that washed ashore several small islands in the Maldives. The investigation began as a result of photos of the debris being uploaded to the social networking website Facebook. Some of the debris is reported to have washed ashore as early as May 31 and was found on a beach owned by the Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru resort, located in Kaafu Atoll. In the past few days, several other pieces of debris were recovered on at least three other islands. Authorities are trying to determine if it may be part of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370). Last week, a piece of a wing known as a flaperon, reported to be from MH370, was found washed ashore on Réunion Island.Pictures taken of the objects recovered in the Maldives on, reportedly, May 31, were posted to Facebook by an employee of the resort. That prompted authorities to launch an investigation into the debris, but before it could be examined, it had already been sent away for disposal. The photographs show a large white object, possibly two, stained with algae and appear to be made of a fiberglass and honeycomb material. The objects appear to be several feet in length and width and in one photo where the paint is severely peeled, red letters "IC" can be seen.  Those pieces, along with others, were taken away and disposed of as trash. When authorities discovered the photographs, they returned to the site, but only found a small, five to seven inch (about 13–18 cm) piece of debris they say doesn't appear to be part of a plane. According to the resort's manager Mr. Naseem, the bigger pieces of debris and other waste were taken away and disposed of in the usual way. He added other forms of debris and trash with no value, such as buoys and suspected military waste, wash up on the islands all the time, especially during monsoon season. Local residents and resort workers regularly collect trash which is sent to the garbage island Thilafushi where it's sorted, exported for recycling, or burned. Reports say at the time the debris was collected, no one suspected it could be from MH370."Although some of it was taken to Thilafushi, there is still a five or a seven inch piece on the resort. It was left because it is small. The management has decided to hand it over to the Police", said an unnamed official to SunOnline, who said authorities don't know if any of the debris taken away has been destroyed. The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of the Maldives Police Service and experts from the Maldives Civil Aviation Authority are heading the investigation.Yesterday, reports stated several more pieces of debris, one piece measuring some eight feet by two feet (about 2.4 by 0.6 m), were found on Baa Atoll, Fehendhoo and Fulhahdhoo and washed ashore sometime in the past few days. One piece appears to have a serial number on the side, possibly reading '021411270507.' Initially residents who found the debris took it home. "A resident had found the debris and taken it home. Nobody had thought twice about it then. When he heard about the discovery in Vabbinfaru resort we immediately called the Police," said Mohamed Ibrahim, a councilman for Fehendhoo Island, to Haveeru Daily.MH370, while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, China, vanished without a trace on March 8, 2014. All 239 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. On the day the plane went missing, residents on the small Maldive island of Kudahuvadhoo claimed to have seen a very "low flying jumbo jet" crash into the Indian Ocean. Some also noted the colors appeared to resemble that of a Malaysia Airlines plane. "I’ve never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly", one resident was quoted as saying to the newspaper Haveeru Daily. Some claim the plane appeared to be headed in the direction of Diego Garcia.According to The Huffington Post, Haveeru reported the witnesses were interviewed by authorities who deemed their statements to be truthful, but Maldive military officials along with Malaysian officials say no such aircraft was in Maldive airspace at the time MH370 went missing. "Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of Flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country [Maldives]. Furthermore, the data of radars at Maldives airports have also been analysed and shows no indication of the said flight", said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein.At least six to eight vials containing a reportedly poisonous gas were found at a United Nations (U.N.) office in New York, according to reports released today. The vials were potentially hazardous and reportedly came from a chemical plant in Iraq.U.N. deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe assured the public they were not in danger saying, "There is no immediate risk or danger." However, the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) building was evacuated, according to federal authorities.The recovered gas was believed to be phosgene, which is used to make pesticides and plastics. The gas can be hazardous at room temperature, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.). The gas was used frequently throughout World War I.The gas was brought to the U.S. from a chemical weapons plant north of Baghdad in 1996.Ewen Buchanan, a UNMOVIC spokesman, said the phosgene gas was in liquid form, "ranging in size from small vials to tubes the length of a pen," she said. Jerry Hauer, former New York City emergency services director, told ABC News that "If it is properly sealed, it should not pose much of a threat unless it is dropped" and "They need to get it out of there and put it in a safe canister...It shows immense stupidity to have that kind of thing sitting around as a souvenir."No toxic vapors were found in the air and no one was injured. FBI agents, WMD teams, as well as hazmat units were all reporting to the scene.Hazmat crews shut down and diverted traffic in the Holland Tunnel leading into New York City when a suspicious package was discovered after an accident.Reports say that the package was found near the entrance of the tunnel outside a gas station in Jersey City on the Jersey Avenue and 12th Street intersection and that the toll booths at the tunnel's entrance have been closed.Police used a robot to detonate the package, but it is not yet known what was inside the package.Shortly after 8:00 a.m. (eastern time) the tunnel was reopened to traffic.Three of Sweden's ten nuclear reactors have been shut down due to safety concerns following an incident last week at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, in which the reactor cooling systems failed. The reactor has since been shut down there. After the incident, the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate, SKI asked all the nuclear power plants to demonstrate that the same failure could not happen in them. On Wednesday, two more reactors at Oskarshamn were shut down after the operator said their safety could not be guaranteed.Last week's incident at the Forsmark plant was triggered by a short circuit that cut  power to the reactor cooling system. Two of the four backup generators also failed to start, but the remaining two worked and were sufficient to meet the plant's needs. Greenpeace reports that the fault in the backup power systems were traced to new equipment installed in 1993. The spokesman of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate Anders Bredfell denied that there was any danger of a meltdown, adding that there was also a backup gas turbine to power the cooling system in an emergency.However, Lars-Olov Höglund, who was responsible for the nuclear plant Forsmark for many years, said the incident was the most dangerous one since Chernobyl and Three Mile island, and that a meltdown was avoided only by pure luck. His views have however been questioned as he is involved in  litigation with the Swedish nuclear industry and is known as an outspoken nuclear critic. Researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology as well as the personnel at the power plant were critical of Höglunds' view.Speaking to BBC News, SKI spokesman Anders Bredfell said that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed of the incident as required and that the incident classes as a '2' in the 0-7 scale used by the IAEA to assess the severity of the incident. Another reactor in Forsmark and a fifth at Ringhals nuclear power plant have been offline due to planned maintenance work. With five of its ten reactors down, Sweden's power generation capacity is down by almost a fifth. The environmental group Greenpeace called on the government to shut down all reactors and probe whether the fault was a generic one. The Green Party has called for an independent investigation of the incident. Sweden is scheduled to retire all its nuclear power plants in the next few decades, as decided by a referendum in 1980.Two people have been killed while mountain-climbing in Switzerland. The bodies of the man, 53, and woman, 57, were found on the Matterhorn at an altitude of around 13,100 feet (4000m). Their names have not yet been released due to Swiss privacy laws; they were both Americans. Their relatives have been notified.The two were reported missing by a family member on Friday morning, and their bodies were discovered later that day.Jean-Marie Bornet of the Valais cantonal police stated that they were climbing and fell to their deaths, and that no guide was taken with them during their attempted ascent to the peak. The weather on the mountain was apparently bad during the time of the climb.The leader of the rescue mission sent out to find them stated that they were both well-equipped, and that their route was not particularly dangerous in normal weather, but they were caught up in a storm. Fog caused them to lose sight of the other members of their party.Acclaimed Swiss mountaineer Erhard Loretan died Thursday on his 52nd birthday  when he fell in a climbing accident.According to Swiss police, Loretan was climbing with a client to the summit of Gruenhor, a 4,043 meter peak in the Bernese Alps, when both fell for unknown reasons from a height of  around 3,800 metres. He was killed immediately while his client was hospitalized in serious condition.Loretan, originally from  Fribourg, was eleven years old when he began climbing. In 1982, he  climbed his first 8,000-meter peak,  Nanga Parbat in Pakistan. He  was the third person to summit all fourteen of the world's 8,000-meter peaks, which he accomplished by the age of 36. This confirmed his reputation as one of the world's top mountain climbers.  In 1986 he ascended Mt. Everest in 40 hours without using supplementary oxygen, a feat that astonished other mountain climbers.Saying that he was essentially a solitary person, he told a Trento film festival in a video posted on its web site last year, "First of all I’d like to thank the mountains, for almost 40 years they have allowed me to climb, and with this passion I’ve lived an extraordinary life up to now, that’s why I’d like to thank them."He added, "I now want to share this passion more with others, and it’s because of this that being a mountain guide is a good profession because you can help someone who dreams about climbing mountains. This is something very beautiful." In 2001 his personal life was marred by a manslaughter charge  for shaking to death his seven-month old son to stop him from crying. He plead guilty in 2003 and received a four-month suspended sentence.  The case ignited a debate in Switzerland over shaking babies.A ferry operated by Sydney Ferries crashed into a whale-watching ship before hitting the Pyrmont Bridge in Darling Harbour at around 1 PM AEDT today. The accident is the second incident involving a Sydney ferry in the past two months.The Sirius, a First Fleet class ferry was carrying around 100 passengers when it attempted to berth at a Darling Harbour warf and failed to stop. It is thought the ferry may have suffered a technical fault.  The Sirius collided with the Ocean Dreaming, a 34-metre whale watching ship which was moored at the nearby Aquarium warf. The Ocean Dreaming had a sole crew member on board who escaped uninjured.Sydney Ferries said that none of its passengers were injured in the accident and all disembarked safely.Will Ford, the operations manager for the Ocean Dreaming recalled the incident. "It looks like one of the ferries coming into the Aquarium wharf has not stopped, and skidded past our vessel," he said."There's a bit of damage to the bow and it's continued on to Pyrmont Bridge where it stopped suddenly."The incident follows an accident in January, when a Rivercat collided with a small boat, killing a fisherman and injuring his son.Manager of Sydney Ferries, Geoff Smith defended the safety record of his services. He said ferry services have improved "out of sight" over the past year.Mr Smith urged the public to put the incident into perspective. "We do about 1,500 along-sides every day, so to have one incident like this, one is too many obviously, but you've got to put that into perspective," he said."Safety is Sydney Ferries' highest priority."Mr Smith told ABC Radio that an investigation would be held into the accident which would involve drug and alcohol testing of the Sirius's driver and crew but said he could give no further comments until the investigation was complete.Opposition activists in Syria say nine or more people have died as the result of a car bomb explosion at a fuel station in the Barzeh al-Balad district of Damascus, the capital of the country, according to BBC News Online. News agency Reuters has placed the minimum death toll at eleven while also reporting at least forty injuries. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights believes an increase in the number of fatalities recorded is probable.At the time of the incident, a large number of people were waiting at the station to collect petrol. Activists say Syria is short of petrol because of the ongoing civil war, which started during 2011. BBC News Online says drivers queueing at fuel stations for hours is a frequent occurrence in the country.An unidentified activist told Reuters the fuel station was "usually packed even when it has no fuel. There are lots of people who sleep there overnight, waiting for early morning fuel consignments". The same person reported witnessing the bodies of burned people being placed onto ambulances, as well as those with wounds and severe burns, and vehicles the blast had destroyed being towed away. The activist, a local resident, said security workers at the station then told him to leave the scene.The Revolution Leadership Council, which is part of the Syrian opposition, cited "a booby-trapped car" as the source of the explosion. It is unclear at this stage as to who was responsible for the incident, although the local activist who spoke to Reuters said there had been increased conflict between civilians and militia supportive of  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at fuel stations recently.Five people were killed and many others injured after Flight 390 of TACA airlines overran the runway at the Toncontín International Airport in Tegucigalpa. The Airbus 320 held dozens of people on board including both passengers and crew, although various accounts are inconsistently reporting occupant numbers. Flight 390 began in San Salvador, El Salvador and just departed its intermediate stop at Tegucigalpa before it was to continue towards Miami, United States.The plane fell to the city streets while approaching the runway at approximately 1600 UTC (10 am local time). The accident occurred in the midst of bad weather from tropical storm "Alma". Among the casualties confirmed are the president of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, Harry Brautigam.File:Air France Flight 447 Empennage removal 2.jpgA search team from Brazil has recovered a part of the tail section of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic on June 1. The Brazilian armed forces have released pictures of divers near the tail fin, painted with the Air France colours of blue, red, and white.Meanwhile, France said that it has dispatched a nuclear submarine to search for the airplane's flight data recorders, which could provide information as to how and why the jet crashed.Sixteen bodies have been recovered from the waters of the ocean last weekend.Brazilian president  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said that "everything was being done [...] so that we can find, if possible, all the bodies, because we know how much it means for a family to receive their lost loved one."The death toll from Wednesday's plane crash in Taipei, Taiwan reached 40 today with the recovery of five more bodies.There were 58 on board when TransAsia Airways Flight 235 crashed into the city's Keelung River. Fifteen survived and three more remain missing. Tzu Chi Foundation volunteer Lee Hung Shu-ying said today cold weather meant the families of the missing believe their loved ones are dead.The Aviation Safety Council is investigating. The plane was in the air for minutes before banking steeply, hitting an elevated road, and crashing into the river. The domestic flight from Taipei Songshan Airport was headed to the island of Kinmen.Investigators are focusing on the ATR 72-600's engines. One engine automatically 'feathered' itself. Feathering involves the turboprop's propeller rotating its blades to reduce drag.Engines autofeather when they fail ('flaming out'). By reducing drag on the non-working engine, a twin turboprop plane can fly safely using only its other engine. A feathered engine will not provide any thrust. The reason for autofeathering is presently unclear; what is known is the flight crew subsequently shut off the wrong engine. A series of stall warnings went off in the cockpit as the aircraft headed to disaster.Aviation Safety Council managing director Thomas Wang confirmed an automated "number two engine flameout" message should have alerted the crew to the engine trouble, leading them to follow "the corresponding checklist". "There are procedures that pilots go through — safeguards — when you're going to shut down an engine, particularly close to the ground," said John M. Cox, former commercial pilot and boss of a safety consultant. "Why that didn't occur here, I don't know."Stephen Fredrick, a former pilot of similar aircraft, told CNN video showing the final seconds is consistent with dual flameout. He said the wings-level, nose-down position suggested gliding. Wang, however, cautions it is too early to blame any particular factor. "At this moment we just release the numbers, the parameter we've confirmed, we did not release any judgment who did what at this time". The Aviation Safety Council has teamed up with engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney Canada to examine the engines. Also being prioritised is finalising a cockpit voice recorder transcript and cockpit examination. The aircraft was near-new.Local prosecutors are investigating potential "professional error", and the Civil Aeronautics Administration has ordered TransAsia retest all ATR pilots. 90 flights over three days are cancelled to allow the proficiency checks. TransAsia and Uni Air have also been ordered to check their collective 22 ATRs for engine and fuel system problems.Pilot Liao Chien-tsung and his co-pilot, not publicly identified, were initially hailed as heroes by prosecutors, mayor Ko Wen-je, international press, and at least one relative of a survivor. After declaring "Mayday Mayday, engine flameout" to air traffic control the pair grappled with their struggling plane, avoiding buildings in its path. They have been credited with reducing the death toll. Their bodies were found in the cockpit, with leg fractures. Both were still holding the wrecked plane's controls.Aljazeera English is reporting a Taliban claim to have shot down the world's largest helicopter. The Russian helicopter is said to have been in use by NATO to supply Dutch troops deployed in Southern Afghanistan.  NATO is reported as saying that the aircraft is missing; probably downed by bad weather. It is said to have crashed Saturday while en route from Kandahar to Uruzgan. No NATO personnel were on board, said NATO spokesman. The helicopter, said to be Russia's largest cargo carrier, was named as Mi-25.  The number of personnel and the nature of its cargo have not been disclosed. It is reported as being owned by DynCorp International which provides "specialised mission-critical outsourced technical services to civilian and military government agencies". DynCorp has been engaged to train police forces and has also been active in anti-drug trading in Central America and elsewhere. Note: the world's heaviest and most powerful helicopter in production is the Russian eight-bladed Mil Mi-26.A suicide bomber has killed at least thirteen people in Swat valley, North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for this attack. The attack occurred at a security checkpoint in the city of Saidu Sharif.According to Ibrahim Khan, a policeman in the district, 37 people were injured in the attack. He added that the bomber, who was dropped from a motorized rickshaw, approached a checkpoint which is manned by army men and police officers. When the attack did not stop, the officers opened fire; the attacker blew himself up at this juncture."Our men carried out these attacks and more strikes will continue all over the country because the entire Pakistan has become a colony of the United States," said Azam Tariq, a spokesman for the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan via telephone to news agencies. "Our 2,000 suicide bombers, who have already spread across the country, will act against security personnel and government installations."Major General Ashfaq Nadeem said two soldiers and two policemen had died in the incident. "Such acts cannot demoralise us. I want to assure the people of Swat that we will continue fighting till the last Taliban are eliminated," he said to the media. Zia-ur-Rehman, 24, a victim, said he was traveling in a different rickshaw when the attacker detonated the bomb and his vehicle was hit. "I thought somebody picked me up and then threw me down. Everybody was crying," claimed the injured man.The attack came just a day after over 40 died in a series of blasts in the Iqbal Town area of Lahore. After the first, large attack, the same region was hit the same night. Three people were injured in the comparatively small blast, said police officials.On Tuesday afternoon a TAM Linhas Aéreas Airbus A320 (flight #JJ3054) crashed while attempting a landing at Congonhas airport, in São Paulo Brazil. The plane reportedly skidded off the wet runway, crossed a busy thoroughfare  before careening into a fuel depot and warehouse ultimately bursting into flames."The plane accelerated when it reached the end of the runway and tried to take off again to avoid the road, but it crashed into the building and exploded," Junior Matos told AFP. Authorities believe that all 180 people onboard the plane have died, and a further 15 people on the ground are feared dead as well.Earlier, there were reports from the Brazilian media that eight people, some from the plane, and some from the gas station, were taken to the local hospital for treatment and that Brazilian congressman Júlio Redecker was also on board the plane. Low clouds and heavy rain were reported at the time of the crash. Additionally, the runway has had a history of problems with standing water. Neither of these factors have been linked to the cause of the crash at this point.Rodrigo Pinho, state attorney, said the authorities will thoroughly investigate "to determine the cause and to identify who was responsible".A preliminary report issued by the USGS states that islands, known as the Tanimbar Islands, near Saumlaki have been hit by an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.0. The earthquake struck the island at 16:04:21 UTC (01:04:21 local time).The incident occurred 293 km (182 miles)  WNW of Saumlaki, 383 km (238 miles) SSE of Ambon and 401 km (249 miles) ENE of Dili, the capital of East Timor.The closest towns are the towns of Bebar, Wulur and Kenli, which are on the nearest island.The USGS has confirmed that "this event has been reviewed by a seismologist."Although the epicenter of the earthquake was offshore, it was very close to nearby islands. It is not known if anyone was injured in the incident.A tanker truck travelling Northbound on Route 30 with 2,500 gallons of diesel fuel hit a guardrail, veered off the road and overturned into the West River near Newfane, Vermont. The West River is a tributary of the Connecticut River. The driver was ejected and killed, while the truck's tank ruptured.The truck came to rest partially submerged in the river on its right side and immediately began leaking its payload. The driver has been identified as 30-year-old Eduard Lashway of Guilford. The vehicle was owned by local company Barrows & Fisher Oil Co. of Brattleboro.HazMat crews and Brattleboro Fire Department divers worked with booms to try to contain the oil leaking into the river. Route 30 was also closed in both directions, and the river closed to water traffic. A total of 100 gallons of fuel leaked into the river but was ultimately contained by HazMat teams.WMUR reached an unidentified person at Barrows & Fisher, who refused to identify the then-unknown driver and said he had no comment on the accident.The accident is under investigation.A tanker crash in Brevard County, Florida on the Beachline Expressway — also know as State Road 528 — killed two people and caused officials to close sections the expressway. Firefighters and Police personnel are currently on the scene and residents were evacuated due to toxic smoke. The tanker collided with a pickup truck on an overpass at approximately 3:40 pm EST (2040 UTC) and subsequently burst into flames. Officials are reporting that both the driver of the tanker and truck were killed. Reports also suggest that there is significant damage to the overpass.Florida Highway Patrol Sargent Kim Montes commented that the expressway could be closed for a while. Florida Department of Transportation officials are currently on the scene assessing the damage and motorists are being advised to take alternate routes. The school district is advising that school bus service may be delayed for certain schools.A tanker explosion on Interstate 75  has destroyed a part of the Nine Mile Road overpass in Hazel Park, Michigan, a northern suburb of Detroit.  One man, truck driver Ronald Martinez, has been killed and only 4 injuries have been reported. On July 15, 2009 at about 8:15 PM EST, a tanker carrying thousands of gallons of gasoline collided with a semi-truck from Meijer grocery stores, causing an explosion that resulted in heavy black smoke that could be seen for miles. It is believed that the tanker was clipped from behind by driver Saied Haidarian-Shahri, 27, of nearby Clawson.  The tanker's two parts broke in half when a semi-truck rammed into the gasoline-filled tanker and it exploded.  The driver of the semi-truck sustained only minor injuries.Saied Haidarian-Shahri was a relatively new driver, getting his license within the past 6 months. Reports say he was doing 70 mph in a 50 mph zone, called the "9 Mile Curve", along the Chrysler Freeway.  There were no traffic violations on his license. He has been blamed for causing the accident. The explosion resulted in the collapse of the Nine Mile Road overpass over the freeway. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has decided that the rest of the overpass cannot be saved. MDOT has closed down the freeway between Interstate 696 and Eight Mile Road both northbound and southbound. Local streets surrounding the site have been closed too. This is expected to cause trouble for commuters who travel one of the most used freeways in the metro area.About 2,000 residents of Hazel Park are now without power due to the accident.A Japanese tanker has spilled an estimated 4,500 tonnes (1.4 million gallons) of crude oil in the eastern Indian Ocean, after colliding with a cargo ship, which it was trying to assist, the tanker's owners report. A statement released by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd, the owners of the tanker, Bright Artemis said that the tanker was attempting to rescue the crew of the distressed Singapore-registered cargo ship, Amar, when the two vessels came in contact about 470 km (290 miles) west of the Great Nicobar Island in the Indian Ocean at 1:00 p.m., (3:00 p.m. JST) on Monday. The collision opened a gash 1 meter in height and 5 meters in length on the single-hulled tanker's starboard side, spilling its crude oil cargo. The statement said that the spill has been contained, the crew of the Amar are safe on board another rescue vessel and no other injuries have been reported. The tanker reported the location of the incident  as 5'46"N, 89'04"E and the cargo ship Amar was on fire when the incident happened, said the statement. It added that oil has been transferred from the damaged tanks to other tanks, the tanker is proceeding east at a reduced speed and that the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore and the Indian Coast Guard have been informed of the incident.The Bright Armetis was manned by a crew of 23 including Croatians, Filipinos and a Canadian and was carrying close to 250,000 tonnes of crude oil from the Persian gulf to Japan, according to the company. Indian Coast Guard officials told Reuters news agency that the spill lies outside India's exclusive economic zone and that they are watching the situation closely.Bloomberg reports that shares of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. fell as much as 4.3% upon news of the event. Mitsui is Japan's second-largest shipping company.A tanker truck carrying approximately 8,600 gallons of unleaded gasoline caught on fire on the Interstate 80/880 interchange in Oakland, California early Sunday morning around 3:40 AM. The fire resulted in the collapse of at least two sections of bridges at the interchange, including one carrying I-580. The multi-level freeway interchange known as the MacArthur Maze connects the Bay Bridge (Interstate 80) to Interstates 580, 880, and 980 and California State Highway 24, and as such it connects several major cities in California, including San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley.The driver, James Mosqueda, 51, of Woodland, California, escaped from his truck before the fire. He was the only person reported to be hurt, suffering second-degree burns. No other vehicles were involved in the crash.The driver was believed to be speeding, resulting in a loss of control of the truck, causing it to flip over and subsequently burst into flames. As the truck was traveling on the interchange of I-80 eastbound to I-880 southbound near the San Francisco Bay Bridge, it is speculated to have hit a guard rail or column during a turn. Shortly thereafter, it exploded into a fire that lasted several hours.Caltrans officials have announced that repairs will be fast-tracked, but will still take several weeks. Public transit has responded with plans to increase service and re-route buses that used the destroyed interchange.Gov. Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency that in addition to expediting repairs will suspend restrictions on truck traffic hours and provide free use of area public transportation on Monday, April 30.The two miners who had been trapped almost one kilometer beneath the surface in Beaconsfield, Tasmania in a collapsed gold mine for 14 days have now been rescued.The men, Brant Webb and Todd Russell, were well enough to walk out from the lift onto the surface and threw their arms up in exultation. They then walked to a board and removed their location tags to indicate that they were no longer underground at approximately 5:59 a.m. AEST before embracing family and friends and making their way to the waiting ambulances. The vehicles slowly made their way through the crowds with a police escort and the miners waved to the crowds through the open rear doors. They will undergo medical supervision at Launceston Hospital for a period of time before being confirmed well enough to return home.The last stages of the rescue, cutting the final sections of the escape tunnel had proceeded very slowly because very hard rock was encountered and work had to proceed gently to minimize the chances of further rock collapses.The escape tunnel was completed at 4:47 a.m. AEST and it took another hour for the men to be transported to the surface via a "crib room" at "Level 375" (375 metres underground) where they were medically examined and were also able to shower.A bell at Beaconsfield's Uniting Church pealed just after 5 a.m. AEST to celebrate the rescue, and an air raid siren was sounded. This was the first time the church bell had been rung since the end of World War II. A local fire engine drove through Beaconsfield's streets sounding the siren to wake residents for the good news.A funeral will be held later today for a third miner, Larry Knight, who was killed in the collapse that trapped the miners on April 26.Babar Ghauri, Federal Minister for Ports and Shipping, has told reporters at a press conference that an investigative team has been formed to look into the causes of a suspicious fire two days ago at the Karachi office of the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC).One office worker was killed and four firefighters were injured in the multi-storey blaze. Another man had to be rescued from the roof via helicopter. 31 people were in the office at the time of the fire, including eight PNSC security guards and six other PNSC personnel, the rest working for private companies.The provincial investigation team's findings are expected to be announced in around fifteen days. In addition, the Karachi Building Control Authority and several private organizations have been asked to inspect the building, and the course of action to be taken regarding the site will be determined after they have submitted their reports. “Even if the current PNSC building is demolished, it will be replaced by another PNSC building. The plot will not be given to anyone else,” Ghauri said.“I have spoken to the prime minister on the telephone. I told him that the incident should be investigated by independent parties and ministry personnel should not be part of these investigation teams,” Ghauri said. Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Ports and Shipping confirmed that they will send a team to assist in investigative efforts.The fire, which consumed floors four to ten, is being treated as suspicious because it is the second the building has suffered this year. The previous fire, which occurred on February 18, was deemed by a multi-national investigation at the time to have been caused by an electrical fault. The minister has, however, promised that the fact both fires occurred on a Sunday will be part of the investigation.This latest fire has destroyed the records of several private shipping companies, causing Farhatullah Babar of the Pakistan Peoples Party to declare that the fire was a deliberate act to destroy undesirable PNSC documents. However, Ghauri was dismissive of the allegations, saying “Babar merely wants some cheap publicity and leveled allegations at us,” and adding that PNSC records have not been affected by the fire. The records are computerised, and stored on the untouched first floor. The offices destroyed by the fire housed private corporations, such as Mega Shipping Company, Attock Cement, Engro, Meezan Bank and others.There was already a known security issue in the building, with PNSC Chairman Tanvir Naqvi telling reporters “We were just about to issue tenders for improving security in the building when this happened.”People described as 'sources in the PNSC' told reporters that the building was constructed by a company based in Turkey for Rs 30 million in 1958. “This building will not be demolished. Damages will be repaired and the building can be made usable,” said one.One man who worked on the fourth floor of the structure, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to represent the PNSC, told the Daily Times newspaper that “The fire initially did not break out on the fourth floor," as originally reported, saying instead “At around 2:00 p.m. we saw smoke coming through our lighting fixtures. Within 36 seconds the smoke was so thick that we could not recognize people standing right in front of us. There is no air exhaust system on the emergency exits. If we had not evacuated immediately, we would have suffocated and died on the emergency exits.”He goes on to claim that of a number of PNSC employees present, not one knew how to operate the fire extinguishers supplied. They started panicking. I broke the glass and used the hose to try to put the fire out. But the smoke was too thick. We were in contact with Adeel (the worker on the roof of the building).”“The fire started in the ducts of the building. The pillars had already been damaged by the February blaze. This time around, the fire was more intense.”A sixteen-year-old girl, Darlene Etienne, was pulled out from underneath the rubble of a collapsed school in Haiti yesterday, fifteen days after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck the country, devastating most buildings in the capital, Port-au-Prince.Etienne had been studying at school in the capital when the tremors stared, collapsing the building. She had apparently survived by drinking water from a bathroom, and the Al Jazeera news agency reports rescuers had heard her mumbling something about having some Coca-Cola.When pulled from the rubble, she was reportedly dehydrated, but happy. Etienne was taken to a French-run field hospital, and later to a hospital ship moored off the Haitian coast for further treatment. "She just said 'Thank you', she's very weak, which suggests that she's been there for 15 days," said the head of the rescue team that recovered the girl, Samuel Bernes, noting that she was located "in a pocket, surrounded by concrete"."She couldn't really talk to us or say how long she'd been there but I think she'd been there since the earthquake. I don't think she could have survived even a few more hours," rescuer Claude Fuilla told the Associated Press."I don't know how she happened to resist that long," said another rescue worker, JP Malaganne, as quoted by the BBC."It all happened very quickly, but rescue teams managed to get her out and she was covered in layers of dust and concrete," said Jonah Hull, a correspondent for Al Jazeera, describing the rescue effort as being "a delicate process".Five days ago, the Haitian government officially ended its search for living people under the rubble; upwards of 130 people have been rescued from underneath the remains of collapsed buildings.A 17 year old gunman has killed 15 in the towns of Winnenden and Wendlingen, near Stuttgart in southwest Germany, before being killed himself in a shootout with police.Dressed in what has been described as black combat gear, the gunman entered Albertville school at 9.30am on March 11 2009 and, beginning with a particular classroom, started shooting at pupils and staff wandering through various 9th and 10th grade classrooms, reloading his handgun a number of times as he did so in a two minute shooting spree.Reportedly aiming at the heads of his victims the gunman, identified as former pupil Tim Kretschmer, initially killed nine pupils, all except one being female, and three female teachers, one of whom was still a trainee who started only 4 weeks earlier. A further seven female students were injured. There are conflicting reports if a tenth student died from injuries later. Other students were injured as they attempted to escape by jumping out of windows.Police received a call within three minutes at 9:33 a.m. the police entered the school at 9:40 a.m. to discover the bodies of the slain victims. A pupil managed to call for help using a mobile phone, and the headmaster apparently gave an early warning via the intercom so that some of the teachers were able to lock the doors to their classrooms from the inside, probably preventing more killings. From the first floor of the school, Kretschmer fired at the first police who arrived on the scene.Kretschmer fled the school as further police arrived, and killed a gardener in a nearby clinic as he did so. As the police evacuated the 1,000 pupil secondary school, Kretschmer, hijacked a Volkswagen Sharan and forced the driver to drive him south. Slowed by a traffic jam Kretschmer forced the driver to drive towards Wendlingen.A police checkpoint was not able to apprehend Kretschmer. The car went off the road, and the gunman fled into an industrial area in Wendlingen about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the school. Tracked by specialist armed police and police spotters in helicopters Kretschmer was finally cornered in the carpark of a car dealership in Wendlingen. Kretschmer, the son of a well known local farmer and businessman, made a last stand and killed a salesman and a customer before being shot by police marksmen being injured in the leg. At first it was unclear if the shooting killed him or if he was wounded and then shot himself. Police now believe that the evidence points to suicide.During the manhunt, police stormed the youth's home in Leutenbach to conduct a search. Kretschmer's father, a hobbyist hunter, legally owned 15 firearms and one was missing from the collection. The majority of the firearms were kept securely locked as German law mandates, however a handgun was kept in the parent's bedroom and it is this weapon that is presumed to have been used. Also, all the ammunition was not locked away, and Kretschmer reportedly carried a "3-digit figure" of ammunition with him.The police are still uncertain about the motive, as Kretschmer was known as a calm, inconspicuous person to the people who knew him personally. He didn't have a criminal record and has apparently not made any announcements of his killing spree, neither online nor to any of his friends.Kretschmer had been a graduate of Albertville school the previous year.Two police officers remain in serious condition.Daisy Yáñez, a 17-year-old from El Huique, near Santa Cruz, Chile disappeared on Saturday morning.Yáñez left a letter to her parents saying that she was "going to end her life in Pichilemu," located more than 80 kilometers (50 mi) from El Huique. Her parents then went to the Cardenal Caro Province capital and filed a complaint for alleged misfortune with the Police.The girl's clothes, a backpack, a cellphone and her documents were found in "the grotto of the Virgin" ("la Gruta de la Virgen"), near the Las Terrazas beach in Pichilemu.Chilean Army, Pichilemu Police, Seguridad Ciudadana (Public Safety Agency), and Investigations Police of Chile personnel are searching Pichilemu's Infiernillo and Las Terrazas beaches for her body.Yañez was suffering from depression due to family problems. "It all was sudden, there were problems in our family and she left the letter yesterday. We are very distressed," one of her parents told Wikinews on Saturday night.A nineteen-year-old California teenager, Lucas Ransom, was killed on Friday when he was attacked by a shark while he and his friend Matthew Garcia were surfing at Surf Beach west of Lompoc and within Vandenberg Air Force Base's 42 mile coastline.  "Imagine a river of blood. That's what the wave looked like for a minute," Garcia said. "It was very stealth. You would have never known there was a shark in the water. It was all really quick." The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department stated that they believed the shark was between 14 and 20 feet (4.3 and 6.1 meters) long.The pair had been in the water for about 45 minutes when a shark appeared and pulled Ransom under the waves, Garcia added. There was no warning. The shark appeared to be about 18 to 20 feet long. Ransom looked at his friend a couple of feet away and said "Help me, dude," before getting lost in the waves, Garcia said. Ransom's parents confirmed that the shark tore his leg from his pelvis and Garcia attempted to revive Ransom with chest compressions, but he died from loss of blood. Witnesses told officials that the teenagers were about 100 yards (90 meters) from the shore when the shark attacked. Firefighters from the Vandenberg Air Force Base pronounced Ransom dead at the scene. "He was a great guy and great friend," Garcia said.Officials immediately closed local beaches after the attacks and they will remain closed for at least three days. Wildlife officials are still trying to determine what type of shark was involved, but based on the boy's injuries it is thought to have been a great white shark, who are known as the most frequent unprovoked attackers. Local lifeguards speculated the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity as Ransom was wearing a gray wet suit at the time, which may have made him appear as a seal. Shark attacks are extremely rare on the west coast of the United States.15-year-old teenager, Ngatai Reweti was sentenced and jailed today at Auckland's High Court for four years after killing Christopher Currie by throwing an eight kilogram chunk of concrete at Auckland's Southern Motorway.Currie, from Taupo, was driving along the Auckland Southern Motorway with his friends when the concrete smashed through his windscreen from the Princes Street, Otahuhu over-bridge, killing Currie instantly.Reweti was originally convicted of the murder of Currie on August 19, 2005 but in July, 2006 a jury overturned this conviction and instead of murder charged him with manslaughter.Justice Winkelmann, during the sentencing, said: "Reweti's actions were serious and of breathtaking stupidity worthy of condemnation." She said it was a mindless act that killed Mr Currie and irreparably damaged the lives of others.Winkelmann has suggested that he should serve his sentence at a youth justice residence and said that it was not premeditated unlike what the crown said.Currie's family are outraged at the sentence. "We feel let down by the justice system. I feel the judge has disrespected us as good people and good people all over New Zealand," said Wayne Currie, father of Christopher Currie.Reweti's family had said that Ngatai was gentle and loving but the deputy principal from his school said that he was often absent and very challenging. Reweti had taken full responsibility for the killing even though he had been smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol the day before Currie died.Aaron Perkins, crown prosecutor, said: "The sentence should deter others from committing such acts and people should be able to travel on the roads without the fear of a missile being thrown and the consequences of that."The handling of the devastation left by Hurricane Katrina, considered by many to be inadequate, has prompted scathing criticism of American politicians. President Bush was criticized for verbally "pandering" to public opinion, while little is done about the tragedy.  In a WWL radio interview, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin called for a "moratorium on press conferences" and said, "[The government is] feeding the public a line of bull, and they are spinning, and people are dying."  The mayor has since apologised for these remarks.  However, the mayor did not address his own alleged failure to evacuate his citizens when he reportedly left hundreds of city-controlled buses idle.Malik Rahim, a recent Green Party candidate for New Orleans City Council, describes the poor organization as criminal, and called for his party to come help when the federal government would permit it.  Grammy award-winning rapper Kanye West created controversy when he said "George Bush doesn't care about black people" and that "America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off as slow as possible" in a telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina.Onsite television news reporters have also levied very harsh criticism against the politicians whom they were interviewing.  Anderson Cooper (CNN) took Sen. Mary Landrieu (D., Louisiana) to task for her detachment (WMV, trancsript).  Andrea Mitchell (MSNBC),  Bill O'Reilly (FOX), Geraldo Rivera (FOX), Scarborough (MSNBC), Shepard Smith (FOX), Robert Siegel (NPR), and Paula Zahn (CNN) have also harshly criticized their interviewees (WMV).  One broadcaster bitterly exclaimed "The only difference between the chaos of New Orleans and a Third World disaster operation, was that a foreign dictator would have responded better."In a press release issued September 3rd, 2005, Democratic Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana claims that President Bush staged a photo opportunity by having rescue equipment quickly moved into the background during the event.  Senator Landrieu claims the equipment was dispersed elsewhere the next day. Landrieu says in her press release, " ... we witnessed a hastily prepared stage set for a Presidential photo opportunity; and the desperately needed resources we saw were this morning reduced to a single, lonely piece of equipment. The good and decent people of southeast Louisiana and the Gulf Coast -- black and white, rich and poor, young and old -- deserve far better from their national government ..."  The breached levee was closed on Monday by a sequence of dump trucks building a narrow pathway across the gap toward helicopter-dropped sandbags. Some responses, however, have concerned themselves not with criticizing the response, but praising the hurricane itself. The American Family Association's Agape Press published praise for the hurricane's destruction as an instrument of God's mercy, in that it "wiped out rampant sin".  Rev. Bill Shanks, pastor of New Covenant Fellowship of New Orleans, said "God simply, I believe, in His mercy purged all of that stuff out of there -- and now we're going to start over again."  "New Orleans now is abortion free. New Orleans now is Mardi Gras free. New Orleans now is free of Southern Decadence and the sodomites, the witchcraft workers, false religion -- it's free of all of those things now," Shanks says.In an exclusive report, Wikinews has learned that a restraining order won by area residents has temporarily stopped the emergency demolition of a three story building which partially collapsed on Wednesday, June 11, 2008 in Buffalo, New York. The collapse caused at least 15 homes surrounding the property to be evacuatedDuring the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to scene at 428 Jersey Avenue after residents called 9-1-1 stating that part of a building had collapsed. A large portion of a former livery and stable had collapsed into the yards of at least four houses that surround the stable. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.According to savethelivery.com, a website set up and dedicated to "saving part of this historic structure", the restraining order was granted on Saturday, forcing demolition crews to halt their work. The site also states that court papers will be filed on Monday in an attempt to hold the owner Bob Freudenheim responsible for the damage done to the building, and surrounding properties. The site states that Freudenheim has neglected the building for "the last twenty years.""We are an outraged and responsibly concerned group of neighbors and citizens who have rallied to oppose the impending demolition of the historic White Brothers Livery and Boarding Stable at 428 Jersey Street, just west of Richmond Avenue," says the site's mission statement. They seek to evaluate all options to saving the building before demolishing it, find immediate support to stop any further collapse, hold Freudenheim personally responsible for "endangering the public safety, and compensation of the city and neighbors for expenses incurred by being displaced from their homes." They also want the city to personally inspect any and all properties he owns and for him to surrender the stable to an interested party who would restore it.Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.According to city officials, Freudenheim is facing housing violations for neglecting the building. Residents state that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished.Although a restraining order is in place, residents still fear that demolition crews will attempt to continue demolition. As a result, police have a permanent detail on location to make sure everyone including both protesters and residents, follow the law.A rally is planned to take place today at 1:00 p.m. for anyone interested in saving the building.Ten children have died after a fire at a disabled orphanage in Haapsalu, Estonia. Forty six people, including thirty seven children, were in the wooden building at the time of the fire. One adult and another child were injured in the blaze. The fire started at 2.30pm local time and firefighters arrived shortly after.Viktor Saaremets, a spokesman for the Western Estonia Rescue Services Center, released a statement saying "By the time rescue workers and firefighters arrived at the scene three or four minutes later the building was completely in flames." According to local media it took the firefighters two hours to put out the blaze.The Estonian government has declared Monday a national day of mourning for the victims after an emergency meeting. President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves said "The tragic accident in the Haapsalu orphanage shocked the whole of Estonia today."The orphanage was opened in 1950 but moved to the current building in 1996 after funding from the Estonian government as well as foreign donors. The building was inspected in January and met all the necessary requirements according to Saaremets. The cause of the fire is still being investigated.Ten climbers at a ski resort in Zigana, Turkey have died in an avalanche. They were part of a group of seventeen from the nearby province of Trabzon. The avalanche occurred at 11:15 local time (9:15 UTC) yesterday on Mount Zigana in the Gumushane region of Turkey near the Black Sea coast. Winter sports are increasing in popularity across Turkey, as it is mountainous.The climbers were at a height of 7,260ft (2,200m) while crossing a deep valley, when the snow hit them. As search teams and locals arrived, they managed to pull seven climbers free from the snow; at least two were taken to hospital, one of which died in hospital. They were walking in a single-file line, as it hit them. One of the survivors made a hole with their arms, so they could breathe. The block of snow dragged them 1,000 metres into a valley as the avalanche traveled down the mountain.The avalanche may have caused by rising temperatures in the area. A gun-shot was also considered as an outside possibility after some witnesses said they heard one. This occurred as climbers were killed in Scotland after an avalanche, as well another seven deaths across the French Alps.Ten pilgrims, four of them women were drowned in the Godavari river in India today.

In total, ten people died after the crash, which involved two helicopters. The dead included passengers and both pilots in the mid-air collision. The victims were taking part in the French reality television show 'Dropped' when the accident happened.The victims included Olympic swimmer Camille Muffat, Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine and Florence Arthaud, a yachtswoman. Both pilots were Argentinian, the remainder of the victims were French and worked as part of the television shows production team. Bodies of all ten of the victims have been retrieved and taken to the morgue. The accident occurred while both helicopters were flying at a low altitude in tandem. Amateur camera footage shows the helicopters colliding when one appears to fly into the path of the other. It remains unclear what caused actions which lead to the crash. Cesar Angulo, Secretary of Security for La Rioja, the province in which the accident happened released an update. He said "An explosion occurred and it's believed that they must have collided. Aeronautical experts will have to determine that."French President Francois Hollande paid tribute to the victims. Speaking about the sport stars who lost their lives he said "They are dead because they wanted to push the boundaries. They wanted to make new exploits known to the world, make people aware of new countries and regions." An involuntary manslaughter investigation has been opened by French officials. The procedure occurred automatically due to the fact the French citizens died abroad.The television show involves contestants taking part in survival style activities in remote locations. Other contestants taking part included figure skater Philippe Candeloro, footballer Sylvain Wiltord, snowboarder Anne-Flore Marxer, swimmer Alain Bernard and Jeannie Longo, a cyclist.

The Bathurst Show is the largest agricultural show in regional New South Wales, Australia.According to police, the incident happened at 5:10 p.m. Saturday (0710 UTC) when a Mazda sedan driven by an 82 year-old woman reversed into a large crowd which had been standing about the showground ring. Saturday is typically the busiest day of the show, with many events taking place in the ring.Police and St. John Ambulance personnel who were already present at the show arrived almost immediately and began providing assistance. After assessing the incident, additional police, rescue, ambulance and fire personnel were deployed.Those injured range in age from five to 71 years. The most severe of the injuries were sustained by a 71 year-old man who suffered head injuries and a five year old boy from a neighbouring city who suffered both head and severe leg injuries. Both have been airlifted to Westmead Hospital in Sydney and are described as being in a critical condition.Other injured people were taken to both Bathurst and Orange Base Hospitals.The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital suffering from shock.Police are investigating the incident, have seized the involved car, and questioned witnesses. Many local citizens have been warning about pedestrian safety for show patrons for a number of years. Their concerns were not about the showground itself, but the fact that patrons have to cross a highway carrying 27,000 vehicles per day unassisted to get from the main parking area to the showground. Following Saturday's incident, the local council has hired crossing guards to help those crossing the highway.Maoist guerrillas detonated a land mine in Orissa, India today, blowing up a bus ferrying Special Operation Group (SOG) personnel of the state. At least ten were confirmed to be dead in the incident while several others were injured. State police said the attack occurred in the Koraput district of Orissa, on the east coast of India.The land mine explosion blew up one of the three vehicles in which the security men were traveling.

Police said the Americans did not have paperwork, nor permissions, to remove the children from the country. If convicted  the Americans could face prison terms of up to fifteen years. Reuters reported that all ten acknowledged they had violated the law when they tried to take the children from Haiti, but denied they were aware of this breach of law until after their detention. Haiti's justice minister, Paul Denis, stated he saw no reason why the missionaries should be tried in the US. "It is Haitian law that has been violated," he told AFP. "It is up to the Haitian authorities to hear and judge the case. I don't see any reason why they should be tried in the United States."At least twelve people are dead as severe thunderstorms in Tennessee destroyed homes and other structures for the second time in a week.Twenty-four people were killed in western Tennessee alone by tornadoes spawned by severe thunderstorms on Sunday, April 2.Throughout the southeastern United States, 52 tornadoes, 515 hailstorms, and 160 reports of damaging winds were reported in an 24-hour period between Friday, April 7 and Saturday, April 8.Terry Knutsen, a man who achieved some notoriety in the 1960s with the novelty song Curse of the Hearse, was seriously injured in a collision late Wednesday evening, according to sources close to the singer.

Authorities state that foul play is not suspected. Campus police and local law enforcement are conducting a full investigation. A campus representative told media sources that the cause of death has not yet been determined.Just last year, a student at the college died from gunshot wounds he'd sustained while attending an event at a community center located on the outskirts of the city. Shortly following that incident, the school initiated a short-term controlled access plan, restricting much of the traffic into and out of the campus.The school is one of several campuses in the TSTC system. According to a press release on the campus's web site, the student's name had not been yet released. The school is reportedly offering counseling sessions to all students throughout the week. A phone call to a campus representative made shortly before 4:00pm CDT was not immediately returned.A Texas man was rescued earlier this week after being adrift at sea for 31 hours, according to media reports on Monday. Joey Trevino, 37, was stranded along with three other men after their boat quickly sank off the coast of Port O'Connor, Texas. With only their life jackets as support, the men floated in the water, unsure if they would be rescued. Reportedly, the boat sank before the men could radio for help. Trevino told reporters he could see the right-most engine at the rear of the boat sinking as the front of the boat rapidly elevated. Three of the men were rescued by a supply boat about 24 hours after the sinking. The US Coast Guard was then notified that Trevino was still lost at sea. He was rescued 7 hours later, when a passing freight ship heard his cries for help. Reportedly, Trevino floated about 50 miles before being rescued. A Coast Guard spokesman stated that water temperatures in the mid-80's was a positive factor in Trevino's survival.To maintain strength, Trevino told reporters, "You're looking at the clouds, you're looking at whatever." He also stated he spoke to his wife, and to his children in hopes they could feel him speaking to them. Trevino stated he did wonder to himself, "Wow, should I just take off this jacket, and let it be over?" His courage was bolstered when he was bumped by a porpoise. "He kind of bumped me and I kind of rubbed him and he kind of changed my attitude right there," Trevino told media.A rash of wildfires in Texas in recent days has left many fire departments stretched thin on resources. Officials say firefighters handled over 18,000 wildfires in the state thus far in 2011; in a recent week there were nearly 200. President Obama declared Texas a disaster area recently.A number of wildfires around the state have struck near or even within populated areas. One of the worst fires yet struck near the city of Bastrop. That fire alone destroyed 45 square miles of land and over 700 residences, according to the Texas Forest Service. Wes Johnston, a captain with the Chandler Fire Department, told Wikinews that earlier this month, his department spent 7 hours extinguishing a single blaze near Brownsboro. Captain Johnston, who is also an accountant, explained that the excessive number of fires has placed stress on his department's ability to cope with the demands. "Most volunteer fire departments [depend on] donations, completely; and donations have been down due to the economic conditions." He went on to describe how fuel and maintenance costs put further strain on most departments' ability to function effectively. "Even the cities have a set budget, for the paid departments, so they don't factor in a' lot of the variables for these types of incidents." Some volunteer firefighters in the eastern part of the state have averaged 2–3 hours of sleep per night recently, due to heavy demands. Even spouses of some firefighters have voiced concern over workloads.Thailand's largest chemical plant has been hit by a fire and series of explosions this weekend. Twelve people have died at the facility in Map Ta Phut, Rayong.Investigations are underway after the four-hour blaze, which wounded more than 100 more and led to large-scale evacuations. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has ordered a committee to investigate potential pollution from the accident, and Sunday visited hospitalised survivors.Police are examining the scene for clues and "more bodies", a senior local policeman said. Rayong Governor Seni Jittakasem said the incident started while a chemical tank was being cleaned. All evacuees are now back home and the dead were mostly plant employees, he said.The area has been controversial for decades. One of the world's biggest petrochemical works, high pollution levels have been noted since the 80s and residents and environmental campaigners have been demanding action since the late 90s in response to the area's high cancer levels.A school bus taking students on a field trip crashed into a truck early this morning in eastern Thailand, killing thirteen students and two teachers.The top deck of the bus was crushed on one side after hitting the truck and spinning. The students aboard ranged from ten-year-olds to young teens and had been headed from their Nakhon Ratchasima school to Pattaya. The bus driver fled and is unaccounted for.The bus was carrying around 60 female students, with a boys' bus from the school following behind. The second bus escaped the accident. The crash was on a narrow, busy road in Prachinburi. The road is in a national park which prevents upgrade works like widening, according to Nuttapong Boontob of the Thailand Accident Research Center.Police Lieutenant Colonel Anukarn Thammavijarn said police theorise the vehicle's "brakes may have failed or the driver might have fallen asleep." Thammavijarn said the bus was out-of-control and going downhill when it struck the 18-wheeled truck from behind. He cited the old appearance of the vehicle as a reason to suspect brake failure for the accident.The crash injured a further 47 people. A row of covered bodies was formed beside the wreckage. Of the injured, 23 were hospitalised. Wounds include broken bones.Road accident rates are among the world's highest in Thailand; last December a bus fell off a bridge, killing 29. Road accidents killed 8,600 on the nation's roads last year. Legislation does not require bus passengers to wear seatbelts.Today, the day that saw the rescue of trapped miners Brant Webb and Todd Russell in Beaconsfield, Tasmania, their colleague Larry Knight, 44 was farewelled at a funeral service in Launceston. Knight was killed when a small earthquake triggered a rockfall killing Knight and trapping Webb and Russell.Mr. Knight was driving a telehandler which had a small cage attached to its lifting arm that Mr. Webb and Russell were inside when the rockfall occurred. Mr. Knight had been a miner for the past five years.Mr. Knight's funeral was held at St John's Anglican church in Launceston and was attended by over 700 mourners including Tasmanian Premier Paul Lennon, Beaconsfield Mine manager Matthew Gill and Todd Russell. It is unknown whether or not Brant Webb attended the service, but it has been reported that he told doctors he intended to.Mourners were told that Mr. Knight was a laid-back man and fitted the expression "Happy as Larry Well". One of Knight's friends since high school and member of Christian motorcycle club "The God's squad", Chris Brooks, said that Mr. Knight had become more content with life and focused on his children in recent years. Mr. Brooks said that Mr. Knight will be "missed deeply".Mr. Knight's daughter, Lauren, who lives in Queensland read a letter she had written to her father for his birthday three years ago. "You're a wonderful, caring, understanding and forgiving father, a long-standing friend, my solid rock and inspiration," she read.According to Ms. Knight, her father kept the letter in the back of a clock for "safe keeping".The God's squad played a major role in the funeral service.  On the way to the cemetery, they provided an honour guard for the hearse, led by someone on Knight's own Harley Davidson.A third man has died today from injuries sustained in the crash of an Royal Air Force Aérospatiale Puma helicopter in the county of North Yorkshire, in the United Kingdom, earlier this week. Twelve people were on board the aircraft when it crashed near Catterick Garrison army base on Wednesday evening during what is said to have been a routine training exercise.The man has not been named but is understood to be a soldier from the Infantry Training Battalion at Catterick. Brigadier David Clements of the Commandant Infantry Training Centre said "We are all deeply saddened by the news that one of the recruits involved in Wednesday's helicopter accident has died as a result of the injuries he sustained. His family were with him when he passed away. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this most difficult time." Flight Lieutenant David Sale, aged 28, and Sergeant Phillip Burfoot, aged 27, died at the scene  of the crash.An explosion was reported at 0610 local time Tuesday morning at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's second reactor. The blast is feared to have breached the pressure chamber.The explosion is thought to have been in the reactor's "pressure suppression room" — part of the cooling system. It damaged the area that contains water to cool the reactor, but it is not yet clear whether it affected the containment structure near the core.Government officials have said that there was limited damage as a result of the explosion, and efforts to cool the reactor would go on, but nuclear industry executives in Japan have said that the situation is far worse, and other unnamed officials said the containment structure had been damaged, but did not say to what extent. In the wake of the explosion, officials at the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant's operator, said for the first time a partial meltdown could be taking place within the reactor.After the explosion, radiation levels near the facility rose from 1,941 to 8,712 microsieverts, a level still short of that required to cause immediate health effects, and radiation decreased again some time after the explosion. The legal limit for radiation in one year is a thousand microseiverts, but radiation sickness does not occur until a million microseiverts.Prior to the explosion the fuel rods in the reactor reported to again be exposed after the pressure valve closed at 11pm local time, preventing pumping in cooling water."The reactor containment vessel, which is the last line of defence to contain the radiation, this may have experienced some damage...it seems that there are damages at several different places of these walls around radioactive substances." [excerpted from live translation transcription by CNN of NHK coverage of press conference, stream]According to TEPCO, all but 50 employees of the plant were evacuated after the incident.Workers at the 40-year old plant have been struggling to deal with the aftermath of Friday's massive earthquake and tsunami. On Saturday, a hydrogen explosion occurred at the number one reactor, followed by a second explosion on Sunday to the number three reactor. The number two reactor was reported to be overheating, with exposed fuel rods, earlier today. Nearly 185,000 people have been evacuated from the 20 km zone around the plant.Geologists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) affirmed that the quake was too weak to cause structural damage to buildings.  In Orange County, the quake lasted 5 seconds and rattled objects on shelves.Geologists expressed concern at the occurrence of three earthquakes so close together in time and space. Other Pacific earthquakes, including one in the Aleutian Islands and another in Chile, have also occurred in recent days.An Iraqi Interior Ministry official today said that thirteen people are in custody in connection with last Tuesday's coordinated bombings in Baghdad that killed 127 people and wounded 400.The announcement of the arrests came as lawmakers again questioned officials about security lapses in the capital, where there have been three massive attacks since the beginning of August. It was also revealed that the US military had warned of an attack on Tuesday, but Iraqi officials say there was not time to act.On Saturday, Iraq's Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani had stated that security forces had prior warning of Tuesday's bombings. He said bureaucracy and a lack of cooperation between government ministries were to blame for security gaps and the inability to stop the attacks.Of the arrests, al-Bolani said: "There are thirteen coffins waiting for criminals implicated in Tuesday attacks, and those criminals will be tried and convicted." The suspects are thought to have ties with al-Qaida.An al-Qaida-linked group known as the Islamic State of Iraq has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's bombings and warned of more attacks.Violence in Iraq has declined in recent months, but militants have continued sporadic attacks. On Sunday, Iraqi police say three car bombings in other parts of the country killed at least three people and wounded more than 30 others.Officials said one car bomb exploded near Fallujah, killing two people and wounding at least seven. Police say the bomb appeared to target a senior security officer, Colonel Saad al-Shimari, who escaped unharmed. At least one child was among the victims in the attack. Another car bomb blast in Fallujah on Sunday wounded at least five people near the home of an official.In the northern city of Mosul, a car bomb exploded near a group of Iraqi army recruits, killing one person and wounding 19 others.The Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Ian Blair, has announced that thirteen people died when a bomb exploded on a bus in Tavistock Square. Initially, only two people were thought to have been killed.All bodies have now been removed from the wrecked bus. The rear of the bus and the roof of the upper deck was torn off in the blast. The bomb was either on the floor or resting on a seat at the rear of the upper deck when it detonated. It is thought that it contained less than 10 pounds (5kg) of explosives.On Friday, thirteen-year-old boy Jesse Hernandez thanked city personnel at the city hall of Los Angeles, California for rescuing him from an underground city sewage pipe near Griffith Park in Los Angeles four days prior on Monday. The rescue was a result of a search and rescue operation on April 1 — Easter Sunday — that took over twelve hours after the boy fell into the sewage by accident. Hernandez said, "I'm so thankful to everybody who was involved in my rescue. Because of them I'm back with my family. And God for giving me another chance to live."On April 1, Hernandez and some friends went to play at an abandoned maintenance building. At around 4:30 PM local time, he fell through a wooden plank that broke, down about 25 feet (7.6 m) into the sewage, according to Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. Adults, immediately told by other children, dialed emergency helpline number 9-1-1.More than 100 people participated in the twelve-hour search-and-rescue effort. The city workers also used a video camera mounted to a floating device.The environmentally toxic sewage was floating around fifteen miles per hour (about 24 kilometres per hour), and anyone falling into it had "slim" chance of surviving, Humphrey said, calling the result "miraculous".City workers identified a search area for Hernandez's location consisting of 6,400 feet (about 2 kilometers) of pipes, 4 feet (1.2 metres) in diameter. After thoroughly inspecting about 2,500 feet (760 metres) of pipes, at around 4 am local time, they found handprints on sewers via the camera, helping rescuers identify the spot near the 134 [State] Freeway, about 1 mile (1.6 kilometres) from the abandoned building. When they went to the camera's location, the rescuers heard the boy screaming, "Help!"The rescue workers lowered a hose 11 feet (3.4 metres) down into the pipe to Hernandez. The boy was treated by paramedics for decontamination, used a worker's cell phone to notify his parents he was rescued, and was transported to the hospital. The hospital released him by 11:15 AM, local time.Later that week, city councilman David Ryu announced city plans to demolish, or secure, any abandoned maintenance buildings, including the one where Hernandez fell from, to avoid similar situations happening again.Thirty people are reportedly dead according to La Nación, in the second-to-last day of the Bicentennial of Chile celebrations through all the country.

Firefighters now fear that the fires could merge into one giant blaze if the Santa Ana Winds continue sending close to if not over 500,000 people running for safety. One person has died as a result of the fires with 42 injured. 16 of those are reported to be firefighters who were battling the blazes."It will not end ... until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around," said San Diego County Fire Battalion Chief, Bruce Cartelli. At least 13 wildfires have burned more than 356,000 acres (142,400 hectares) in areas stretching from San Diego, near the border with Mexico, to Malibu, near Los Angeles.Air Station Miramar for the U.S. Air Force is also being evacuated with the base's planes and other military equipment being transported away from the raging fires to Arizona and places far north of the fires in California.Several reports coming out of Myanmar today suggest that thousands of monks involved in protests against the Burmese government will "be sent away" to prisons outside of the capital city of Rangoon. Other reports are stating that the number of monks killed by Burmese troops are in the thousands.According to reports by BBC News, at least 4,000 or more monks have been arrested and questioned by government authorities in their recent crackdown on protests favoring democracy for the nation. It is reported that they are being held at the Government Technological Institute, the Kyaikkasan racing track and in a prison called Insein Prison. From these locations, they will be transported to prisons located in the extreme northern part of Burma. The monks have not been allowed to wear their robes and are in shackles, and some of them have been beaten. Many have also initiated a hunger strike, refusing to eat. Although the Burmese government reports only 10 monks to have been killed, other reports from activists and media agencies say that the death toll is in the thousands.Pictures have surfaced claiming that thousands of dead monks have been dumped inside the Burmese jungles. Many of the monks who managed to escape capture from troops have dressed in civilian clothing and have begun to hide inside their temples or have fled Rangoon."Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand," said a deserter of the Burmese army and a former intelligence officer, Hla Win.  He also states that he deserted the army when he was ordered to kill monks in what he called a "massacre of holy men.""I decided to desert when I was ordered to raid two monasteries and force several hundred monks on to trucks. They were to be killed and their bodies dumped deep inside the jungle. I refused to participate in this," added Win.An unnamed diplomatic official from Sweden also claims that at least 40 monks were beaten to death, then their bodies were burned.Meanwhile, Ibrahim Gambari, an envoy for the United Nations is in Burma attempting to resolve the issues there and meet with government officials, but he has been unsuccessful so far in arranging a meeting.  New reports say that the government is making Gambari wait another day before there will be the possibility of a meeting."He [Gambari] will come back tomorrow and he will meet with the senior general tomorrow in Naypyidaw," said an unnamed U.N. Information Ministry official. Gambari is waiting to meet with Senior General Than Shwe, the head of the junta, to urge a resolution to the violence. This is the second day the meeting has been postponed.As many as 3,200 mine workers became trapped in the in Elandsrand mine, a gold mine in South Africa about 50 miles (80 km) west of Johannesburg in Carletonville, Gauteng, after an incident on October 3. All miners have been rescued, and none of them were injured. The mine is owned by Harmony Gold Mining Corporation.The mining company says that a lift electrical cable broke on a basket that was carrying miners, trapping thousands at least 2,200 meters (1.3 miles) below the earth's surface. Reports from MSNBC and the Guardian Unlimited say that the shaft may have collapsed when a water or air pipe burst. The rescue operation went well with no complications, with the rescue taking just under 24 hours to complete."They were underground when the accident happened and they were not able to surface because an electric feeder cable that is connected to the mine lift was severed," said a spokeswoman for the mining company, Amelia Soares. The snap was caused by a "fatigued" air pipe which burst and fell down the shaft damaging the "steelwork and electrical feeder cords," added Soares. "They are all in good condition.""They are all safe. There have been no injuries or deaths," said CEO of Harmony mining, Graham Briggs who also said that the miners were previously contacted and were given "food and water."Earlier reports had stated that Lesiba Seshoka, a spokesman with the National Union of Mineworkers, said that the miners have not been heard from for hours and that they could have been enduring temperatures as high as 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius)."This is a terrible situation. The only exit is blocked, probably by a fall of ground," said Seshoka.Rescue workers used a mine shaft that is next to the damaged one in an attempt to reach the trapped miners, and lifted them out, 75 at a time. There was no emergency exit in the shaft which is reported to have "not been maintained for ages," added Seshoka."An escape route is the most important thing and they have failed miserably. They need to ensure that the shaft is maintained. This is why we have this disaster. Our main worry is for more than 3,000 people who are underground," said National Union of Mineworkers for S. Africa chairman, Deon Boqwana.Current reports say that "negligence" was the initial cause for the pipe burst and that there has been a history of negligence from the mine. "We suspect negligence. Because of continuous operations there is no time to make adequate checks," said the President of the Miners union, Senzeni Zokwana to reporters during a news conference.The Elsrand mine is currently under development and has been since February 2001 when Harmony bought the mine. Officials state that the mine will remain closed for a minimum of six weeks, while an investigation is performed, and the mine is deemed safe for miners to continue working in it.The mine is located in the Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa, which is said to be the location of the largest area of raw gold on the planet.As part of an update by the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) into its investigation of a fire on a Boeing 767 cargo plane at San Francisco International Airport last week, it has been revealed the operator received a threat the week before.ABX Air, a contractor for DHL that is also known as Airborne Express, received a threat against them, although no specific aircraft was mentioned. However, the NTSB also said that initial investigations have revealed no evidence of a bomb or an incendiary device.The fire at 10 p.m. Saturday broke through the jet's exterior just behind the cockpit. The two-man crew had been preparing to start up the jet's engines for takeoff at the time, but escaped without injury. Both have been interviewed by the NTSB, and the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder have both been sent to Washington where they are being analysed at the NTSB's headquarters.Records kept by the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Authority indicate that the aircraft, which was manufactured in 1987, had had no previous issues. It had transported passengers until 2004, when Israel Aerospace Industries converted the plane for cargo transport. Israel's Ministry of Transport has sent a representative to assist the investigation, and Israel Aerospace Industries will serve in an advisory capacity.Also assisting with the investigation were the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, the Transportation Security Administration, the San Francisco Fire Department and the San Francisco Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting division. Under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 13 other firms involved with the aircraft, such as Boeing and ABX, will also be party to the investigation.The NTSB expects the on-scene portion of the investigation to be completed by July 6.A criminal investigation has begun in Edinburgh after three children were killed in a fire at a three storey house just before 3pm yesterday.Firefighters were called to the house on Slateford Road in Scotland's capital city, for a reported gas explosion, and they put out a small fire in an upstairs room. However, there was no evidence of an explosion and none of the surrounding houses were damaged. Three young children, two boys and a girl, were found to have died at the scene. Police are treating the deaths as suspicious.A woman, believed to be the children's mother, was found injured on the ground in front of the house and there are reports that witnesses saw her jump from a third floor balcony. She was taken for treatment at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.In a statement the Lothian and Borders Police said: "The investigation into the cause of this tragedy is in its early stages." However, the police have also said that there was no fault with the gas supply.Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out on the children's bodies.  Police said no identities would be released until these were completed.A police spokesperson said: "A criminal investigation is currently under way and nothing more can be said at this time into the circumstances which led to their deaths."The mother of the three children, now named as eight year olds Gianluca and Augustino and five year old Cecilia Riggi, is to be questioned by police after details emerged that suggest it is unlikely the children died in the fire.Neighbours have reported that they heard screaming from inside the house and one source said that when they found the victims lying dead in the living room it was "a horrific scene." However reports that the children died before the fire broke out have not been confirmed by official sources and only reports by neighbours and others at the scene have indicated this. Police refused to confirm reports that the children had died before the fire broke out, and say that the results of the post-mortems would help them decide whether to launch a murder inquiry into the incident.According to Detective Superintendent Allan Jones the mother, Theresa Riggi, and her three children had been living in Edinburgh for little over a month since they were reported missing from their home in Skene, Aberdeenshire last month. Mrs Riggi is currently in a stable condition in hospital and Det Supt Jones said they are hoping to speak to her on Thursday. He said: "She's not in a position to speak to us at the moment."The children were reportedly at the centre of a custody battle between Mrs Riggi and the children's father, Pasquale Riggi. He has been informed and is helping police to determine the last movements of the family. He is not a suspect in the investigation. Det Supt Jones reported: "He's heartbroken but he's very composed. He realizes he holds a lot of central information that we need. We're conscious of the trauma he's gone through."Theresa Riggi and her husband were going through divorce proceedings and she was due to appear at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday. She apparently did not attend the hearing. At that time the judge was told that her whereabouts were once again unknown.The Judge, Lady Clark, granted a search warrant for Mrs Riggi and said that social workers should supervise the children, applying for child protection orders if necessary, after Mr Riggi's counsel asked for an order to safeguard the children's interests.The children were allegedly educated at home so the Social Work Department had had no contact with the family since they moved to Scotland from the US.It is believed that Mrs Riggi may have turned on the gas, and that a neighbour smelled the fumes and called the emergency services, which may have led to the original report of a gas explosion.Tributes of flowers have been left close to the scene with cards of sympathy and condolences.After an explosion Tuesday at a ConAgra Food plant in Garner, North Carolina in the United States, three employees were unaccounted for as search teams carefully worked through the rubble. The search was hampered by stormy weather, darkness of night, and the instability of the partially collapsed building. The bodies of all three have now been recovered. They were Rachel Mae Poston Pulley, Lewis Watson, and Barbara Spears.The latest estimate is that 41 people were transported to area hospitals, including seven to the North Carolina Jaycee Burn Center in Chapel Hill. Of those seven, four remain in critical condition, two are in fair condition, and one is in good condition. A prayer vigil is scheduled for Friday night at an area church for the dead and injured.The cause of the explosion is still unknown, though investigators from several agencies have already begun examining the remains of the building for clues. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board is already on scene investigating, and the National Response Team of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will arrive Thursday to conduct their own investigation.KYTX-TV News is reporting that police are investigating a suspicious phone call to the plant over the weekend, but will not comment if that call is related to the accident.ConAgra CEO Gary Rodkin has already taken steps to compensate the injured employees. They will continue to receive their regular paychecks for the foreseeable future. In addition, the company itself has started a United Way fund to support the families of those involved in the accident. It has seeded the fund with US$100,000 of its own money, and is encouraging ConAgra employees from other internationally located plants to donate to the fund as well.A series of explosions occurred in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, on Thursday, in which at least three people died and at least 70 people were wounded. The army says the explosions were caused by five M-79 grenades; three in the Saladaeng Skytrain station on Silom Road, one close to Dusit Thani Hotel, and one near a bank. The Thai government said the attacks had been from anti-government protestors. The explosions occurred in the business district of the city.Television footage showed ambulances coming to the area and locals carrying the injured to safe spots. Office windows were destroyed and pavements had traces of blood.Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd, spokesman of the army, mentioned that five M-79 grenades had been used in the attack. Three of these were thrown through the roof of Saladaeng Skytrain station, along Silom Road, the central part of Bangkok's business district, he added. He said the fourth and fifth bombs exploded on a pavement close to the five-star Dusit Thani Hotel and near a bank, respectively. The attacked railway station was soon closed, according to sources.Central Bangkok has been the site of recent protests staged against the current Thai government. A coalition of protesters, named the Red Shirts, have been demanding new elections and the resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva for five weeks. Recently, 21 people died in clashes between the Red shirts and government forces. The military has recommended using tear gas, rubber bullets and other ammunition to prevent the protesters from causing disruption, if necessary. However, Army Chief General Anupong Paochinda is reluctant to use such ammunition, being unwilling to renew violence.Carbon monoxide poisoning is thought to have been the cause of the deaths of three people and one Jack Russell dog in a caravan park in Cornwall in South West England. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service (CFRS) were alerted to the incident in Tremarle Home Park in the town of Camborne at 12:56 UTC on Saturday. Inspector David Eldridge said Devon and Cornwall Police were alerted to the caravan park incident after "a helper had been unable to get a reply from an elderly couple who lived in the caravan". He said that upon their arrival, "We were able to see that there was a figure sat in a chair but they were unresponsive to knocks at the door." CFRS workers called to the area "forced entry into the property and found that the three occupants were all dead", Inspector Eldridge said. A hazardous material advisor was also present at the scene in North Roskear. The Health and Safety Executive is now investigating the incident but the deaths are not considered as being of a suspicious nature.The three fatalities have been identified as Audrey Cook, aged 86, her husband Alfred, aged 90, and Maureen, their 46-year-old daughter. David Biggs, a member of Camborne Town Council, said the incident came as "a shock" to him; Tremarle Home Park is "a well established facility and is very well run", according to him. Biggs described the loss of three lives as an "appalling tragedy".The incident came five days after Cornwall Council announced its Family Placement Service would launch a joint venture with Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service to place carbon monoxide detectors in the houses of foster carers. The programme, entitled 'Be Gas Safe', has seen 200 carbon monoxide detectors and 2000 leaflets to raise awareness about carbon monoxide being given to CFRS. Mark Blatchford, Group Manager of CFRS, said: "We have seen a big increase in the number of carbon monoxide incidents in Cornwall over recent years". He described carbon monoxide detectors as being "as important as a smoke alarm as it provides a valuable early warning".Carbon monoxide is a poisonous, colourless, tasteless and odourless gas which is created when such carbon-based fuels as oil, gas, coal and wood are not completely incinerated. The human body's capacity to hold oxygen in the blood can be reduced by inhalation of the gas, which in turn may cause death. The Gas Safe Register has said dizziness, headaches, queasiness, lack of ability to breathe, fainting and losing consciousness are all symptoms of a person experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning.A Canadian Forces CH-149 of 413 Squadron based at CFB Greenwood, Nova Scotia crashed while conducting a night training exercise. Killed in the incident were Sgt. Duane Brazil, 39; Master Cpl. Kirk Noel, 33; and Cpl. Trevor McDavid, 31. The aircraft was conducting a hoist operation at 12:30 AM local time near a Canadian Coast Guard Vessel. The helicopter ditched near the ship and suffered damage to the forward fuselage but remained floating. All seven crew were recovered from the wreckage. In addition to the three killed, four others were taken to hospital. One of the injured was transported by air ambulance to Halifax for further treatment. The CH-149 is a Canadian designation for the AgustaWestland EH101 built in Italy. Canada purchased 15 for Search and Rescue duties. This is the first fatal crash in Canadian service. The aircraft were previously grounded due to cracks in critical rotor components which were believed to be the cause of the crash of a British Merlin (EH101) in 2004. The aircraft involved was number 149914 indicating it was the 14th of the 15 aircraft delivered (serials 149901 to 149915).A fire at a Rexam Plastics factory in China has claimed the lives of three firefighters. Nine more were injured in the accident in Shanghai's Fengxian District.The first emergency call was received by Shanghai Public Security Bureau's 110 Command Center at 12:20 p.m. and reported the Jinhui Town factory as alight. A total of fifty fire engines and around 300 firefighters were dispatched to the scene of the blaze at the Rexam Plastic Packaging (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. facility.Shortly after 2 p.m. a fifty-metre-long structural girder collapsed onto a group of firefighters. Those killed were crushed beneath it and died instantly. They were identified as Yao Lei, 20, Shi Jianhua, 31, and Yu Hai, 27. The nine injured were taken to Fengxian District Central Hospital, where one was transferred to Ruijin Hospital with burns and another to Shanghai No. 6 People's Hospital with suspected injuries to his spine.All are said to be in a stable condition. There were no other injuries to firefighters or the general public.The fire was contained by 5:30 p.m. and extuinguished by 8:00 p.m. At its height it covered 2,000 square and smoke was spread over ten kilometres. The area was sealed off as a petrol station was 200 metres from the area, and air and water quality tests are underway. A nearby drinking water plant was shut down as a precaution.Rexam employees said the fire spread rapidly because flammable raw materials and plastic products were stored in the workshop, which had most of its equipment destroyed. Meanwhile, local authorities say the beam fell due to poor construction. Production at the site is not expected to be affected.An office block fire in Ürümqi, northwest China has claimed the lives of three firefighters and injured a fourth. The 12-storey dual-purpose office and market building was completely destroyed in the blaze, which also spread to and severely damaged an adjacent hotel.According to a spokesman for Xinjiang fire brigade, an eyewitness reported that the fire, which started at around 8:20 p.m. local time on Wednesday night, originated in a stall selling mops on the first floor of the Dehui International Plaza. According to a security guard, the building had been emptied of customers 20 minutes before and consequently few people remained in the building at the time of the fire. Fire crews arrived within 15 minutes of the fire starting.The plaza's basement up to its fourth floor contained a total of approximately 2,000 stalls selling items such as clothes, cosmetics and toys. Floors five to 12 housed offices.All 12 floors were engulfed by fire, and fire crews eventually abandoned efforts to tackle the conflagration amid fears of a collapse. The fire continued into Thursday afternoon, but has since been controlled. It burned for a total of nearly 22 hours. A neighbouring 20-storey hotel also caught fire; only the seventh floor was affected before the second building was put out. All guests were evacuated.As of 6:30 p.m. there was still much smoke in the area, but no visible flames. Rescue workers remained unable to access the building due to continued intense heat. A total of 435 fire fighters and 84 fire engines were involved in the emergency response. 100 firefighters continue to check the hotel for any small fires, which may remain to be extinguished. Structural measures have been undertaken to prevent the steel framed plaza from collapsing when the metal comes into contact with cool night air, which typically falls to temperatures of minus 20 degrees centigrade.The injured fireman has been hospitalised and is in a stable condition. The deceased were identified as Zhu Xiaolei, Zhang Yu and Gao Feng. They had been conducting a search of the building to check for anyone who may have been trapped. Feng was initially considered missing, but was subsequently confirmed to have died. It is presently believed no civilians were injured in the blaze.A quantification for the value of damages caused is not yet available. Authorities have launched an investigation into the disaster.A car fatally crashed into three individuals in the British city of Birmingham, England. The three men, aged 31, 30, and 21, died during a second consecutive night of violent events in Birmingham.The incident occurred at approximately 0100 BST (0000 UTC) Wednesday morning in the Birmingham inner-city region of Winson Green. The men were attempting to protect property from nearby riots. Witness reports say that the vehicle contained as many as three passengers and drove at a speed of fifty miles per hour without stopping after the crash.Police have since recovered a vehicle and arrested a 32-year-old male in association with the incident, on a charge of murder. According to Chief Constable Chris Sims, the details of the incident West Midlands Police have would indicate that "the car was deliberately driven". Tariq Jahan, the father of one of those killed, said his son, 21-year-old Haroon Jahan, was attempting to protect the area from nearby violence and unrest. Jahan said he had attempted to perform CPR at the scene of the incident. Jahan said his son was "a very good lad, a good man starting at the beginning of his life and had his whole life ahead of him. I've got no words to describe why he was taken and why this has happened and what's happening to the whole of England." Jahan said violent acts like this which killed innocent bystanders made "no sense". A statement released from West Midlands Police says that "detectives are treating [this incident] as murder. Three men were taken to hospital where two later died from their injuries. A third man was in a critical condition but confirmed dead at around 6:30AM. West Midlands Police have launched a murder inquiry, arrested one man in connection with the incident and recovered a vehicle nearby which will be examined by forensics experts," the force stated. Police have requested that individuals contact them if they have any information about the incident. About 200 people from the Asian community have gathered at the hospital where the victims were transported after the crash. Two of the victims were known to be brothers. All three of them were reported to be Pakistani Muslims.The West Midlands has seen other instances of violent behavior. Thefts have taken place in the city centre of Birmingham, West Bromwich and in Wolverhampton. The charges being brought against suspects on remand for court appearances include public disorder offences, such as violent disorder and aggravated burglary. Six police officers have experienced minor injuries as a result of the violence.According to police, a scrapyard fire which occurred in Birmingham is unrelated to recent violence. Two ambulances were attacked in two separate incidents with objects being thrown at the vehicles. Ambulance staff were left uninjured in both cases. Ambulances have appeared on thirty-five occasions in West Bromwich, Wolverhampton and various parts of Birmingham. Thirty-one individuals were given ambulance staff treatment, with nineteen receiving hospital treatment, albeit for practically minor assaults in most cases.In Wolverhampton and West Bromwich, there have been reports of roads and streets being closed. Wolverhampton and Birmingham have experienced significant travel disruption, with buses not entering city centres last night. One vehicle in Birmingham and two in West Bromwich have been set alight amongst the violence. Various businesses have also been targeted, such as M&S and a high fidelity shop in Birmingham. A jewelry business in Wolverhampton has been robbed of ornaments, watches and money.Yesterday, British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg condemned the violent actions of individuals, claiming there was "simply no excuse whatsoever for the violence, looting and destruction". Below is a picture gallery of the damage caused by public disorder in Birmingham Tuesday night:Three teenagers were killed and two others were seriously injured near Dyer, Tennessee, United States early Tuesday afternoon when a driver with a restricted learners license, lost control of her sport utility vehicle, ran off the road, and struck several trees. Kayla Pate, 16, lost control of her vehicle when her right tires left the road and she attempted to swerve back onto it.Two teens were pronounced dead on the scene and one later died in hospital. The deceased were identified as 17-year-old Ryan Williams, 15-year-old McKenzie Coble, and 15-year-old Anthony Jones. Driver Pate and another passenger, Hope Jones, were seriously injured. None of the teens were wearing seatbelts.Tennessee's Graduated Driver License stipulates that drivers under 18 can have only one passenger in a vehicle unless he or she is accompanied by a licensed driver more than 21 years old who holds an unrestricted license. Tennessee also requires seatbelts for drivers and all passengers.Three rescue workers at the Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah were killed trying to rescue six trapped miners who have been missing for over a week.Utah's governor, Jon Huntsman, honored the dead rescuers by saying, "There's nothing more selfless than someone giving their life in pursuit of saving someone else."Six other workers were injured in what is being called a seismic "bump." Seismologists said a similar incident happened on the day of the original August 6 cave in. A "bump" is caused by coal shooting out from the walls of a mine due to extreme pressure. No further details were available about the official cause of the rescuers' deaths. Their identities also were not released.All rescue efforts to find the remaining six missing miners have been called off for now. It is not known at this time if the six miners are alive or dead.Three power plant workers at the Salem Harbor Power Station in Salem, Massachusetts died overnight after being severely burned when a water tube they were near burst releasing high pressure steam which burned the men on the head, face, neck and hands just before 9 a.m. EST yesterday.According to Dominion Resources, the Richmond, Virginia energy company which bought the 1950s-era coal-firing plant, from USGen New England, a bankrupted subsidiary of Pacific Gas & Electric, the three men, two operators and a mechanic were working on the ground floor of the plant on a coal-fired generator when the boiler tube exploded twenty feet above sending high pressure steam at a temperature of 320 degrees Fahrenheit and was, according the Salem Fire Department, down towards them.The three men, Mark Mansfield, 41, of Peabody, Phillip Robinson, 56, of Beverly and Matthew Indeglia, 20, of Lawrence were first rushed to the North Shore Medical Center in Salem before being transported to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston where they died overnight."All three men passed away," said hospital spokeswoman Christina Jeffrey."All of Dominion is greatly saddened at the deaths of these men, They were valuable members of our Salem Harbor family. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families," announced Thomas F. Farrell II, Dominion chairman, president and chief executive officer.The boiler involved is 50 years old and, according to plant officials, is inspected yearly. The Salem Fire Department said they have received 19 calls concerning the boiler over the past five years, which, according to the fire department, is not unusual. The area where the explosion occurred was last inspected in April. The boiler tubes carry high-pressure water and steam to turn the turbine generators, which spin to produce electricity.James "Red" Simpson, business manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 326 has worked at the plant for 25 years said, "In my experience with the plant in the 25 years that I have been here, I can't say enough for the safety programs that are in place. These gentlemen who were sadly killed yesterday were some of the best-trained power plant workers. All of the safety precautions that had to be in place at the time of the accident, were in place."Dominion has shut the plant's four generators down for a safety review and to assist employees with the deaths. The plant powers 740,000 homes and employs a 145 employees and is located on Fort Avenue in Salem on a 65-acre waterfront site and uses coal-fired generators but also has a generator that runs on oil.Three Mexican fishermen from the Mexican State of Nayarit have been found by a Taiwanese tuna trawler near the Marshall Islands after spending 9 months and 9 days at sea on a small open top fishing boat eating what ever fish and birds they could catch and drinking only rain water.Experiencing problems with their two small outboard engines soon after departure from home port of San Blas on the Mexican Pacific coast on October 9 last year, they drifted more than 5,000 miles (8000 km) west trying to call the attention of passing ships before being picked up by the Taiwanese trawler where they are currently being held.In an interview with Mexican television station Televisa one of the men commented:"We ate raw sea gulls, ducks and fish. We ate everything raw [...] any fish that came near the boat we grabbed it and gulped it down" one time going more than 15 days without food, but constant rain had kept them from thirsting. To keep up their spirit the three fishermen took turns reading the Bible.The three men, Salvador Ordonez, Jesus Vidana and Lucio Rendon, had been presumed dead when their families were notified of their miraculous rescue.Police were kept busy around Blayney in New South Wales' central west this morning as two separate crashes on the Mid Western Highway claimed three lives. Both accidents occurred within 20 minutes of each other and were only seven kilometres (4 miles) apart.The first accident occurred five kilometres North of Blayney towards Cowra at 7:45 a.m. AEST. A B-double truck carrying woodchips slammed into a parked table-top truck as it went around a corner. As a result of the crash, the B-double rolled over. The parked truck's passenger died at the scene, while its driver was airlifted to Orange Base Hospital suffering abdominal injuries.A second accident occurred two kilometres south of Blayney, towards Bathurst. Both the driver and passenger died when their car left the road and collided with a tree. Police said they were investigating the crash and would prepare a report for the Coroner.In a report released in 2004, the NRMA said that the government should give priority to upgrading the highway among others within the region. In 2005, the NRMA also expressed concern about the highway being reclassified as a regional road (from a state road), putting the onus for maintenance and improvements on councils, which already have limited resources.According to a 2004 audit conducted by the NRMA, the Mid Western Highway is the fifth safest highway statistically in NSW with 18.7 major crashes per 100 million kilometres travelled and 11.5 fatalities per 100 million kilometres travelled. According to the NRMA, the most dangerous highway in NSW is the Great Western Highway, which has 51.5 crashes and 30.8 fatalities per 100 million kilometres travelled.Upon closer examination of statistics, the safety record of the stretch between Bathurst and Cowra (which also happens to be the most heavily used) is comparable to that of the entire New England Highway and more dangerous than the Pacific Highway with 29.5 crashes and 15.6 fatalities per 100 million kilometres travelled. A 14-kilometre section between Bathurst and Blayney is particularly dangerous according to the NRMA.Three large earthquakes hit Sunday near New Zealand and Guam in remote parts of the South Pacific Ocean, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The first quake which happened at 2:08 (UTC) was a magnitude 6.8 and located 345 kilometers (215 miles) south, southeast of Hagåtña, Guam. The second occurred at 5:23 (UTC) and was a magnitude 7.3 and located 200 k.m. (125 miles) northwest of Auckland Island, New Zealand. The third occurred at 9:47 (UTC), also a magnitude 6.8, was located 235 km (145 miles) west, northwest of Auckland Island, New Zealand. All three of the quake's epicenters were less than ten miles deep.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, none of the quakes caused a tsunami, though local advisories were issued.There was no damage, injuries or deaths reported in any of the quakes.In the centre of the English city of Birmingham, three vehicles collided and eight people are reported injured. The crash was on the Aston Expressway; of the eight injured two are said to be in a serious condition. No fatalities have been reported.The two people most seriously injured are both female, one in her 30s and the other an elderly woman. Both women had to be freed from the vehicle they were in when the crash occurred at approximately 1845 UTC yesterday. According to a spokeswoman for West Midlands Ambulance Service: "The elderly woman sustained chest and abdominal injuries and the woman in her 30s suffered head and pelvic injuries in the crash." Both were transported to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham by ambulance.Meanwhile, two women in another car also had to be freed from the vehicle they were in. One of them was injured in the shoulder while the other female's collar bone was fractured. "Both were immobilised with neck collars and spinal boards before being conveyed by land ambulance to City Hospital," according to the ambulance service spokeswoman. Two males in the same vehicle were also taken to City Hospital, Birmingham, having experienced minor injuries.A man and a woman travelling in a separate vehicle managed to escape serious injury in what the ambulance spokewoman called a "significant collision". They were taken to Heartlands Hospital by ambulance.The United States amusement park operator Six Flags has shut down nine thrill rides at four parks after a 13-year-old girl's feet were cut off on a tower-drop ride yesterday at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville.Kentucky state officials said a loose cable on a ride called the Superman Tower of Power severed the girl’s feet above the ankles, but they had not determined how the cable broke free, or at what point in the ride the accident happened. The ride lifts passengers 177 feet (54 metres) straight up, then drops them nearly the same distance at speeds reaching 54 mph (86 km/h).The girl, whose identity has not been released, was taken to a hospital. Details of her condition were not immediately available.Six Flags spokeswoman Carolyn McLean told The Courier-Journal that there has never been a major incident on the Tower of Power. Formerly known as the Hellavator, the ride was built in 1995.In addition to Kentucky Kingdom, rides have been shut down at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois; Six Flags St. Louis in Eureka, Missouri; and Six Flags America, Prince George's County, Maryland.A Superman Tower of Power Ride at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington has not been shut down because it is not the same as the ones in Kentucky and the other locations that have been shut, Six Flags spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg told the Associated Press.The rides that have been shut down are made by a Swiss-owned company called Intamin.Cedar Fair Entertainment Company said it was shutting down similar thrill rides at its theme parks at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio; Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario; Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia; Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina; and Great America in Santa Clara, California.A zoo worker is dead and two visitors are seriously injured after a Siberian tiger escaped from the San Francisco Zoo in San Francisco, California in the United States and attacked three people who were inside a cafe.The tiger was shot dead by police who were called to the scene. They found the tiger attacking one of the zoo visitors when they killed it."Apparently, right around closing time -- there was a pen with four tigers in it -- one of the tigers got out. The tiger went into a cafe at the zoo and attacked a patron. That person ended up dying at the scene. They shot the tiger, and the tiger is deceased," said zoo spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge.After the tiger attacked the worker, it then went on to attack the two other visitors. No names have been released, but reports say that the two injured visitors are male and brothers aged 18 and 19. The person killed is also being reported as male aged 23 who is reportedly a friend of the brothers. Both the injured individuals are currently receiving treatment at San Francisco General Hospital.All animals were then counted and accounted for after the zoo was locked down, including the three other tigers that were in the cage. Earlier reports suggested that all of the tigers had escaped, which later turned out to be false.The incident is currently under investigation, but authorities are not ruling out any possibilities, including possible negligence."We won't know until tomorrow whether this was negligence or intentional or how the tiger got out," said Sgt. Steve Mannina of the San Francisco Police Department.The zoo has two different kinds of tigers, two Siberian and one Sumatran tigers. The Siberian tigers are named Tony and Tatiana while the Sumatran is named Padang. It is not yet known which of the two Siberian tigers was involved in the attacks.Last year, another zoo worker was seriously injured by Tatiana while attempting to feed her, but survived the attack.A trainer at the Shanghai Zoo was bitten by a tiger and later died Saturday morning.  Reports say that the handler was found in a critical condition inside of the tiger's cage early Saturday.The handler, 53-year-old Li Zhonglin, was cleaning the tiger's cage, and at 08:30 local time (0030 UTC) he was suddenly attacked.  Xinmin Evening News reports that witnesses saw the tiger pounce on Li and then gnaw his neck.  At around 08:40 local time (0040 UTC) veterinarians arrived at the scene and subdued the tiger.  One witness said that "Zoo staff said that the tiger didn't have anything to eat the whole day yesterday, it must have been starving."The 10-year-old Bengal tiger has since been isolated. There are no reports of any previous incidents with this specific tiger.Zoo officials are now saying that a Siberian tiger that escaped her enclosure at the San Francisco Zoo in San Francisco, California on December 25, killing one and severely injuring two humans in the Terrace cafe, may have climbed or jumped over the walls that kept the tiger inside her habitat."The animal appears to have climbed or otherwise leaped out of the enclosure. There was no way out through the door," said Robert Jenkins, the zoo's director of animal care and conservation. The tiger has been identified as Tatiana, one of two Siberian tigers at the zoo. The other Siberian, Tony, was not involved in the attacks.Police, who shot and killed Tatiana, are considering the incident a "crime scene" until they can determine if foul play may have been involved."[The incident is being treated as a crime] because we're not certain why the incident occurred - as result of human action or whether this was an incident where the animal was able to get out of the grotto," said Chief of the San Francisco Police Department Heather Fong.The tigers at the zoo are held captive by the combination of a 20ft (6m) tall wall and a 15ft (4.5m) wide moat. Zoo officials say that there are no cameras around the enclosure, and the incident was not caught on any security cameras.After the incident, all captive animals were counted and accounted for after the zoo was locked down, including the three other tigers that were in the cage. Earlier reports suggested that all of the tigers had escaped, which later turned out to be false.Reports say that Carlos Sousa, 17, was killed by Tatiana, but the names of those injured have not yet been released. The human victims were all male, aged from their late teens to mid twenties. Both of the injured, aged 19 and 23, suffered severe upper body and arm lacerations, but their conditions have been upgraded from critical to stable condition at San Francisco General Hospital. It was earlier reported that one of the victims might have been a zoo worker, but later reports state all three were visitors."Our two victims, I'm happy to report, are doing very well right now. They are in very stable condition; they're in good spirits," said Dr. Rochelle Dicker to reporters at the hospital during a press conference.Animal experts don't believe that the tiger attacked for food. Jack Hanna, animal expert and Director Emeritus of the Columbus Zoo in Powell, Ohio states that its possible someone may have "taunted" or "teased Tatiana.""Were they taunting the animal? I don't know that right now. Were they throwing things that were making it angry? This is a first in this country. I've never heard of an individual (zoo visitor) being killed by an animal. It's much safer going to a zoo than getting in your car and going down the driveway," stated Hanna.In 2006, a zoo worker was seriously injured by Tatiana while attempting to feed her, but survived the attack.The zoo's two surviving tigers remain unexhibited while the investigation continues.  The zoo currently has two species of tigers, one Siberian and one Sumatran tiger.A Croatian train en route from the capital, Zagreb, to the Dalmatian city of Split crashed, killing six and wounding 40, according to medical authorities. The incident occurred 12:08 pm (1008 GMT), when the two-carriage tilting train derailed near the town of Kaštela, outside Split. 91 passengers were reported to be aboard the train at the time of the disaster, including foreign tourists. Among the injured are: 18 Croatian, 6 French, 2 Australian, 3 Swedish and four others; a Belgian, British, Slovenian and Pakistani national.The cause of the crash is still unknown, but passengers claim that the speed of the train was excessive. Other reports say railway workers put anti-weed ointment on the tracks before the accident, making them slippery.Shortly after the crash, a railway works vehicle coming to the site of the accident, also reportedly in excessive speed, nearly hit emergency workers and reporters. No one was injured in the incident, but was filmed by a TV crew.Croatian media say that this is the worst railway accident to have occurred in independent Croatia, adding that if the train derailed into a ravine, which is several meters ahead, the death toll could have been much higher.More than a ton of TNT stored illegally in the basement of a karaoke bar caused the recent explosion that killed 25 people and injured 41 more in the north-eastern Chinese town of Tianshifu, news reports say. Qu Yujie or Yijie (known locally as Qu Hua), owner of the two-storey Tianying Karaoke Hall and Bath House which was levelled by the blast was amongst those killed. He was described as "a successful businessman" who owned a local colliery. Many residents of Tianshifu, where the blast occurred stated that he regularly used the basement of the building as a storage site for his explosives. His elder brother and his elder brother's wife were also among the deceased according to Benxi county government spokesman Fu Qingbin. As part of a short statement regarding investigative results made available to state news agency Xinhua on Sunday, the following conclusion as in to the cause of the disaster was given: "After more than three days' efforts, we found self-ignition of the explosives led to the explosion,".Reports state that there were many students celebrating the end of exams at the bar when the explosion occurred - eight teenage girls who were part of a group of 13 from a local department store celebrating a the 19th birthday of Sun Bo, including Bo herself, and several pedestrians outside the building were amongst the casualties of the disaster. The drivers of a truck and a motorcycle passing the building when it exploded were also killed, as were a couple who owned a car wash near to the site. The explosion also buried a number of cars under tons of concrete and blew out windows in nearby buildings.Police estimated that over a ton of TNT was required given the force of the explosion, and noted that the explosives had been manufactured by a factory in the local area. This was backed up by the Beijing News quoting an investigator as saying "The explosion was so powerful that there must have been about one tonne of explosives,". The coal mine the explosives were intended for is one of around 3-400 in the local area, which operate both legally with licences and illegally without. Detonators were also recovered from ground zero.Relatives of the deceased are currently being put up at local hotels in preparation for compensation discusions with the authorities. Of the 41 injured survivors, all are still being treated in local hospitals, four with "serious injuries" and the remaining 37 with "fractures, chest injuries and broken ribs", according to one physician. One person suffered injuries of a severity that required him to be taken to the Benxi City Central Hospital, while the rest are in either Benxi County No. 1 hospital or at a hospital in Tianshifu itself, according to deputy director of the Benxi County Health Bureau Jiang Yongcheng. A dozen extra medical experts have also gone to Benxi County to help treat the victims.Tokyo Electric Power Company, owner of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan, has for the first time released figures on how much radioactive waste the facility has emitted, since being damaged by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake on March 11, 2011. Approximately 20 trillion to 40 trillion becquerels of nuclear energy has leaked since the disaster occurred, TEPCO said when releasing their data on August 5, 2013.Hours after TEPCO made these figures public, a Japanese Nuclear Regulation Authority (JNR) task force said that there is a “high possibility” that this waste has contaminated water along the coast of Miyagi, the prefecture to Fukushima's immediate north.“Right now we have a state of emergency,” Shinji Kinjo, head of the JNR task force, said.The release of TEPCO’s figures came just one day after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake hit Miyagi. No serious injuries or structural damage have been reported so far. Russia Today reports that the tremor hit in approximately the same location oas the 9.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Fukushima in 2011 — a disaster that destroyed much of the Fukushima power plant, claimed the lives of over 15,000 people and caused over 3,200 people to go missing.Nearly 400 people are involved with the clean-up operations. Among them are military specialists for chemical warfare. The Ukrainian Army alert state was raised to “high readiness” state on Tuesday, when the scale of the accident became clear. 27 medical brigades, 13 consultants and seven specialists are inspecting the surrounding inhabited areas.Two of the fifteen phosphor containers that were involved in the accident have been raised and put on new transports; nine of them need more work to treat leaking and damaged areas. All containers are to be transported to a more secure location by Saturday. The situation on the ground appears to be confusing. Political TV channel, Kanal 5, reports that the village closest to the accident, Ozhidovo, is still requesting volunteers to send medicines and water, as they do not have any. Journalists of three TV channels (Inter, Novyj Kanal, ICTV) needed medical care themselves after being in the village.TV channel, UT-1 reports this evening that the Ukranian President, Viktor Yushchenko, has called an urgent meeting of the National Security Council. The accident appears to be likely to become a topic of contention in the long-standing rivalry between the President and the Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. Yesterday, the President publicly criticized the government’s work. Politicization of the disaster is likely to be the main reason behind the extreme differences among the versions of the Ukrainian media. Some declared the accident “ended” a few hours after it occurred, while others are still making alarming reports.On July 18, the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) of the European Commission reportedly offered EU assistance to the Ukrainian government. The same sources say that Ukraine has not officially requested the help. Without a formal request, EU assistance cannot begin.On the same date, NATO Spokesman in Brussels, Mr. James Appathurai, is reported by Podrobnosti to have declared that the Alliance is following the situation, and that NATO has not received any request for help from the Ukraine, either.Tonga's largest criminal trial today ended in the conviction of four men and the state shipping firm over the sinking of MV Princess Ashika. 74 were killed when the ferry went down off Nuku'alofa in 2009.The vast majority of bodies remain missing. Only two were recovered, including one Tongan — a 21-year-old mother called Vae Fetu'u Taufa. The Shipping Corporation of Polynesia (SCP) manager John Jonesse, acting director of the national department for ports and marine affairs Viliami Tu'ipulotu, captain Viliami Makahokovalu Tuputupu, and first mate Semisi Pomale were all convicted of her manslaughter by negligence. The men were remanded into custody over the weekend to await sentencing; they face a maximum of ten years in jail.Justice Shuster cited the severity of the offences in denying bail, which was requested by Laki Niu and Vuna Fa'otusia, attorneys representing the accused.Built in the early 1970s, by 1985 the ferry was found to be unseaworthy and hence not suited for use in deep water. When SCP bought it in 2009 from Fiji, it suffered from "huge" rusting holes and on August 5 that year sank in deep water during a storm. Most passengers were sleeping below deck when the ship was lost near the island of Tongatapu, where it remains on the seabed. No women or children escaped.The six-week trial followed a royal commission of inquiry that found Jonesse, from New Zealand, bought Princess Ashika "without any proper due diligence, surveys, inspections, valuations, documentation or proper inquiry having been completed." It also concluded Tuputupu chose to sail that day despite the ship leaking on other journeys. The inquiry branded the loss "a result of systemic and individual failures... The tragedy is that they were all easily preventable and the deaths were completely senseless."SCP was convicted of charges concerning the vessel's seaworthiness by the jury, which sat in Tonga's parliament building after the trial's high profile saw it moved away from Nuku'alofa Supreme Court.Jonesse and Tuputupu have both been convicted of five counts of taking an unseaworthy ship to sea under the Shipping Act, for voyages held on July 3, July 9, July 15, July 23 and August 5. Jonesse is also guilty of forgery and knowingly using a forged document.Actor John Barrowman escaped serious injury in a 80mph crash while filming a segment for TV show Fifth Gear in Powys, Wales.  One of the show's presenters, Tiff Needell, was in the passenger seat at the time of the accident.Barrowman, whose character in the BBC series Torchwood is unable to die, lost control of the Subaru before plunging down an embankment. The car flipped four times before coming to a rest, narrowly avoiding landing in a lake.Paramedics at the scene managed to pull the two stars out of the car, having to remove glass from Barrowman's eye and later taking him to hospital.Three years ago, Richard Hammond, presenter of rival show Top Gear, was involved in a 288mph crash while filming a piece for the show.A tornado, spawned from a large storm, has hit the United States city of Atlanta, Georgia, causing extensive damage throughout the city. The National Weather Service confirmed Saturday morning that it was a tornado that struck the city. After reviewing the aftermath of the storm, they classified it as an EF2 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale. Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin says she is beginning to apply for federal disaster aid.There have been no confirmed deaths, but the mayor's spokeswoman says there may be dead victims trapped within the ruins of a collapsed loft complex. The Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts are located in the historic Cabbagetown neighborhood, where at least 20 homes were destroyed. "It looks like a bomb went off, it looks like World War III," said Mahsud Olufani, who has an art studio in the neighbourhood. "It's a disaster area."At least 27 people suffered injuries, mostly cuts and bruises. One person is reported to be in critical condition. Grady Memorial Hospital, where many of the injured were taken, had suffered some window damage but was still operating. Around 50 people have been taken to a local Red Cross shelter for displaced residents.The tornado struck during the semifinal game of the SEC Basktetball Tournament between Mississippi State and Alabama. Play was stopped with around 2 minutes to go in overtime when heavy wind could be heard outside with rippling of the roof. Damage was done to the roof as debris fell to the floor. No injuries were reported in the Dome. "I thought it was a tornado or a terrorist attack," said Mississippi State guard Ben Hansbrough.The storm arrived with little forewarning. A tornado warning was issued for the downtown area a few minutes before the storm hit. "Ironically, the guy behind me got a phone call saying there was a tornado warning," said Lisa Lynn, who was attending the game at the Georgia Dome. "And in two seconds, we heard the noise and things started to shake. It was creepy."The CNN Center in downtown Atlanta was severely damaged, especially in the atrium, where the ravaged ceiling allowed water to pour in. Police closed several streets near the CNN Center because of the debris, which included power lines, billboards, and even office chairs. The Omni Hotel, which is attached to the CNN Center, also sustained damage, with many of its windows shattered. Visitors at the hotel were evacuated to the exhibition hall at street level. "It was crazy. There was a lot of windows breaking and stuff falling," said Terrence Evans, a valet at the hotel.At Centennial Olympic Park, located near CNN and the Omni Hotel, two Olympic torch sculptures had fallen over, and a performance pavilion was destroyed. A high-rise dorm at Georgia State University was damaged by the tornado, as evidenced by a large hole in the building's 14th floor. University students were evacuated on buses.According to Georgia Power, more than 13,000 of their customers are currently without electricity. Crews are working to fix downed power lines, but they said it would be difficult with all the debris.Another large storm, currently in Mississippi, is heading towards Atlanta, and is forecast to arrive around 3 p.m. National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Leary said Friday's storm could be "nothing to compare with what's coming in tomorrow".All downtown events scheduled to occur Saturday have been cancelled. This includes the city's Saint Patrick's Day parade. The remaining SEC tournament games are to be played at Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum, located in the undamaged midtown.A British Royal Air Force tornado war plane has crashed into the ocean off the east coast of Scotland. The two crew are reported to have been injured during the crash. The plane got into difficulty after taking off nine miles south east from the planes base, RAF Leuchars.The injured crew are being flown by helicopter to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. At present their condition is unknown.At least 19 people have been killed in central Florida in the city of Lady Lake and Paisley after severe storms and a tornado ripped through the cities in the middle of the night. Eleven of those killed were in Paisley and three were in Lady Lake.The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews resume tomorrow morning.Volusia, Sumter, Lake and Seminole counties have all been declared a state of an emergency as dozens of houses, mobile homes and a church were destroyed. Clothes and furniture are scattered around the wrecked houses and pieces of trees are scattered about. Cars are reported to have been turned over or thrown around in the air."Our priority today is search and rescue," said Gov. of Florida, Charlie Crist. Rescuers are still looking through the wreckage to find survivors of those who might have been killed.A spokeman for the emergency response team of Lake county, Chris Patton calls the damage "devastating" and worse than "hurricanes in 2004.""We have complete devastation of homes, of businesses, religious institutions. It was unlike even perhaps the hurricanes of 2004 when we had minor roof damage, screen damage, pool damage. This is way far more devastating," said Patton. The storms hit at about 3:15 [EST] a.m. on Friday morning. At least 20,000-30,000 people are without power.A tornado has struck Kensal Green in North West London. Up to 150 houses have been damaged, and six people were injured, one seriously. Residential roads were closed off, but most have now been re-opened. Residents have had to seek temporary accommodation. Traffic was also diverted causing disruption but has now returned to normal. The cost of the damage is estimated to be at least £20,000,000.A tornado struck Huntsville, Alabama on Thursday, causing widespread damage and injuring around six people. Packing winds estimated at 150 miles per hour, the twister ranked as EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.The tornado occurred at 5:30 P.M., amidst a flurry of severe weather reports in northern Alabama and Tennessee, bringing down trees and power lines.As many as 10,000 people were left without power, and debris was strewn throughout the hardest-hit areas. "I'm shocked. I lived in this neighborhood all my life. I have never seen this kind of damage," said Amanda Nelson, a resident of Huntsville.David McCullough was at his home home when the tornado hit. He said, "I could not hear the train, but could hear my house shake. I also hear[sic] my neighbor's roof pounding against my house."Although tornadoes in January are rare, they can strike at any time of the year. According to Governor Bob Riley, "The tornado that hit Huntsville last night is a reminder that severe weather can strike anywhere and at anytime."The path of the tornado was reported to be from one half to three quarters of a mile wide.  City spokeswoman Lynn Onstot estimated the path to be nearly four miles long; Jasper County emergency management director Keith Stammer put its length around six miles.Witnesses described entire blocks of buildings destroyed.  Steve Runnels of the National Weather Service said "We have reports of significant structural damage to strong buildings. Automobiles have been flipped, bark was stripped off trees."Among the properties damaged was a local hospital, St. John's Regional Medical Center.  Some patients were hurt, and all were evacuated to other regional hospitals.  The local high school, Joplin High School, was also hit.  Describing the damage, its principal, Kerry Sachetta, said "You see pictures of World War II, the devastation and all that with the bombing. That's really what it looked like. I couldn't even make out the side of the building."Joplin has a population of about 50,000.President Barack Obama has ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to support state and local efforts in response and recovery.  He issued a statement with condolences to the families of victims.During heavy rainstorms that flooded rail lines and subways, a tornado touched down in New York City, the National Weather Service reports. It sustained winds around 111 mph to 135 mph, causing damage to buildings and vehicles. Starting from the Bay Ridge area, the tornado continued for two miles through Brooklyn. At least one person was killed. The roof of a Nissan dealership had been ripped off, as was that of a Brooklyn church. At least 16 homes were damaged. Torrential rain had drenched the region early Wednesday, causing delays at Newark, JFK, and LaGuardia airports. Wind and rain caused major slowdowns in the mass transit lines, virtually halting services. The brunt of the storm struck the city during morning rush hour, a time when hundreds of thousands of vehicles and people are in transit to work. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said that in some flooded subways, police resorted to crowd control tactics to stop rioting. Trees were torn from the ground and some cars were crushed.In a damage assessment tour of Brooklyn, Mayor Michael Bloomberg remarked, “I don’t know that God had rush hour in mind when the storms hit.” The Metropolitan Transit Authority expects service to return to normal by Thursday. At a press conference MTA chairman Elliot "Lee" Sander said the pumps located citywide in the rail and subway lines are adequate to handle 1.5 inches of rain per hour. He said the rain, however, came "too fast and with little warning." "The storm took us by surprise because it was not predicted by the National Weather Service."Early Saturday morning winds up to 90 miles per hour struck Waco, Texas and central McLennan County, United States, causing widespread damage and leaving many households without electricity.No deaths or serious injuries have been reported; however, there is a tremendous amount of damage in 15 areas of the city, leading Mayor Virgina DuPuy to declare the city a disaster area.The hardest hit area was Franklin Avenue, where the Coca-Cola bottling plant's roof was peeled open as if by a giant can-opener.  There were Sprite bottles spread out onto the street.  The nearby Furniture Row shopping center was also hit hard.  Some furniture was found as far as three-quarters of a mile away.  Other hard-hit areas were Robinson, Hewitt, Woodway, and Speegleville.  Densely populated Inner Waco was spared of any catastrophic damage, though hundreds, and possibly thousands, of trees have fallen, and roofs destroyed.The main concern is restoring power to over 23,000 households and businesses.  Many gas stations and grocery stores in the disaster areas were closed until power is restored.  Those that remained open have had to throw out all perishable items.  Also of concern is getting electricity to those with medical needs.  The city has provided help to those without power at the Dewey Recreation Center.The storm is the hardest to hit the area since the tornado that struck on May 11, 1953, which tore through downtown and killed 114 people.Waco has seen more than its share of tornadoes recently.  Only a week ago, an F1 tornado damaged many houses along Orchid and Kendall Lanes.  No people were injured, though two horses were killed when their stable collapsed.The National Weather Service confirmed this morning's winds were a F2 tornado, where wind speeds may have reached 115 miles per hour in some locations.An EF4 tornado struck near St. Louis, Missouri Friday night, forcing the closure of Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and damaging over 2,700 buildings in St. Louis County. The National Weather Service also confirmed that an EF1 tornado touched down in neighboring St. Charles County and an EF2 touched down in Pontoon Beach, Illinois.The city of Bridgeton, in North St. Louis County, was hit by the EF4 tornado. According to the National Weather Service, it was the most powerful tornado to touch down in the St. Louis region since 1967, with winds ranging from 166 and 200 miles (267 and 322 kilometres) per hour. Aftereffects of that tornado were also reported in Maryland Heights, Missouri.One official estimated that anywhere from 50 to 200 homes in the Maryland Heights and Bridgeton areas incurred damage, but early numbers released by St. Louis County indicate that over 2,000 buildings in those two cities had suffered "noticeable damage," which does not include minor damage. Around 30,000 people in the region did not have power Saturday, out of a total of 47,000 affected residents.Authorities with search and rescue dogs went door-to-door Saturday, looking for possibly trapped residents. Aerial imagery was being used in damage assessment. Area residents unaffected by the tornado were assisting those that lost their homes, reported St. Louis television station KSDK.The Harmann Estates neighborhood of Bridgeton was heavily damaged during the storm, with many residences losing roofs and siding. Officials have already condemned some of the subdivision's homes. St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley reported 25 homes in Bridgeton and Berkeley, Missouri as being completely destroyed and an additional 35 as uninhabitable.Granite City, Illinois was struck by the EF2 tornado, while New Melle, Missouri was hit by the EF1. Fourteen New Melle homes sustained minor damage, while four were heavily damaged.The storm also caused the temporary shutdown of two major St. Louis highways. Portions of Interstate 70 and Interstate 270 were closed Friday night due to fallen power lines and storm debris. Both blocked sections have since reopened, but officials said it would take a few days to remove all the debris, which they pushed onto the roadsides.Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, which is immediately west of Berkeley, suffered heavy damage Friday night from the same tornado, and was forced to halt all regular operations Saturday while crews worked to clear the affected terminals. Eight flights had been forced to land in Kansas City, Missouri Friday night due to the tornado. About 500 people were in Lambert Airport when the tornado hit. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spokesperson said other US airports were not affected by Lambert's shutdown. Lambert is not an airline hub and is significantly less busy than it was ten years ago.In a Saturday press conference, Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge, Lambert's director, said the airfield and Terminal 2 were "fully functional," but the main terminal's Concourse C had been severely impacted by the storm. That terminal, which sustained the heaviest damage, serves Air Tran, American Airlines, Cape Air, and Frontier Airlines. The total cost of repairs at Lambert is expected to be in the millions of dollars, but Hamm-Niebruegge said the airport does not yet have a good estimate.One passenger of a waiting plane at Lambert told KSDK that heavy winds pushed the aircraft about 20 feet (6.1 metres) while it was still attached to the gate. Two other planes on the tarmac were unable to return to the airport, so passengers were bused back. Five planes—four operated by American and one by Southwest Airlines—suffered damage, and some will undergo major repairs.Some travelers inside the airport received medical attention for minor injuries caused by flying glass. A handful of people were transported to a local hospital for additional treatment, but all were later released. "We get to the terminal and lights were out, glass everywhere, blood everywhere from people had been cut," recalled one witness. Another person at the airport reported, "The ceiling was falling. The glass was hitting us in the face. Hail and rain were coming in. The wind was blowing debris all over the place. It was like being in a horror movie. Grown men were crying."On Saturday, it was evident that Concourse C would not be open for some time, said Mayor of St. Louis Francis Slay. A large section of its roof was missing and around half of its windows had been blown out by the high winds. Debris and water from the storm were present inside the airport as crews worked to restore power and assess damage to the terminal. Missing windows had been boarded up, ruined carpet had been removed, and the control tower was functional by Saturday afternoon. The power was back on by 7:40 p.m. CDT (00:40 UTC) that evening.The airport resumed outgoing flight services Sunday, although several incoming flights landed at Lambert Saturday evening. Slay said the airport will be running at 70 percent capacity until mid-week, depending on the availability of airline crew members and planes. Airlines using Concourse C will have their operations temporarily relocated, he added. On Sunday, Southwest was operating at normal capacity, while AirTran moved to Concourse B and canceled four of its eleven scheduled flights. A spokesperson for American said the airline would have planes ready for normal Monday operations. American had previously canceled all St. Louis flights scheduled for Sunday.On Saturday afternoon, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon arrived at Lambert and visited areas devastated by the tornado. He originally planned to tour Maryland Heights, Bridgeton, and Berkeley, but Nixon was only able to tour Berkeley due to an approaching line of storms. While in St. Louis, the governor said 750 Missouri homes had been damaged by Friday's tornadoes and that federal assistance was forthcoming. Nixon reported that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was involved in assessing storm damage, as well as that US President Barack Obama had already contacted him, promising relief funds. US Representative Lacy Clay, said Saturday that he would brief Obama on the situation.The state declared the affected areas of St. Louis County a disaster area. No one has reported serious injuries or deaths as a result of the storm, although some people were treated for minor injuries. "It was horrific and for that much damage to been done, to have no loss of life, is truly a blessing," Slay said.At least 23 people have been killed in late afternoon in broad daylight, with dark (very dark) clouds tornadoes that ripped through the central United States on Saturday May 10 with over 150 reported injured and at least three people are missing. Tornadoes hit towns on the Missouri and Oklahoma borders which caused significant damage. Several watches and warnings for storms and tornadoes remain today. At 4:11 a.m. (eastern time) on Sunday, nearly the entire states of Georgia and Alabama were encompassed with tornado watches and severe thunderstorm warnings.In Picher, Oklahoma where the tornado is reported to have started, 7 were killed, including an infant. The tornado then traveled across state lines to Missouri where 14 were killed near Seneca and then into Georgia where two people were killed. Officials state the death toll is likely to climb. "It’s a bad deal. There are maybe 150 badly damaged homes on south side of town," said Picher's town attorney, Erick Johnson. More than two dozen streets in Picher are described as being wiped out. Oklahoma's governor Brad Henry has ordered the national guard to the area to help in aiding those hit by the storms."[Our] thoughts and prayers are with the people of Picher and all of the other Oklahoma communities," said Henry in a statement to the press, who also plans to visit the areas hardest hit on Sunday.Buildings have been destroyed and people have been reported to be trapped in debris from tornadoes that touched down. Trees were thrown from yards and cars were overturned. Tornadoes were also reported in Arkansas and in Oklahoma, one tornado left more than 15 miles of destruction with some places seeing a path over a half mile wide. Rescue efforts are hampered by the darkness, making it difficult for rescuers to find people who are trapped."It's hard to do in the dark. They're going over the hard-hit area and turning over everything and looking," said Susie Stonner, a spokeswoman for SEMA.At last count, 34 tornadoes were reported in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, but reports say that some eyewitness accounts were of the same tornadoes. At 02:48 (UTC) on Sunday morning, Doppler radar for the National Weather Service showed very strong storms in Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri and Mississippi.Residents in Mississippi awoke to scenes of destruction after two tornadoes touched down before sunrise near the town of Magee and in a rural area of Lauderdale County, around 90 miles east of Jackson. Dozens of homes and a church were demolished, and at least 20 people injured near Magee. Mayor Jimmy Clyde in an interview on NBC's Today show commented that the town was in "dire straits." The town is currently without power, and most roads heading into and out of town have been made impassable by debris. No deaths have been reported so far.Eleven homes and businesses were damaged by the tornado in Lauderdale County, near the Alabama border. In Magee, the only thing left standing at the 100-year-old Corinth Baptist church are its doors. "Our church is still here, because our church is the people, but the building is gone," said a parishioner. Two people had to be airlifted to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Mississippi Department of Transportation workers are laboring to restore power and other utilities to the affected areas. Due to the time of a day, many people were caught off guard and were forced to scramble to safety. One resident tearfully summarized the night's events: "I lost everything."A cleanup effort is underway after torrential downpours on Friday, September 4 caused significant flooding in the north-east of Scotland. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said that the weather forecast in the coming days was improving, with no large amounts of rainfall predicted. Over 500 homes had to be evacuated in Moray after the River Spey and River Lossie started to overflow their banks. 400 homes were also evacuated in the Elgin area and 50 more in Fochabers. Other areas affected included Aberdeen, Dyce, Lossiemouth and Rothes, where 25 homes had to be evacuated. Over 600 homes were evacuated in Morayshire.The Grampian Police and Tayside Police advised residents not to drive unless absolutely necessary. The Northern Constabulary advised residents to travel with caution.In some places, a month's worth of rain had fallen in just 24 hours. About 67 millimetres of rain had fallen in Aberdeen - roughly the equivalent of an average month of rainfall. In Lossiemouth, the rainfall was 76.4 millimetres - 15mm more than the average amount every month. As cleanup efforts progressed, Chief executive of Moray Council Alistair Keddie said, "Everything possible was done to protect residents." However, some residents of the local areas are not so certain.Mary Campbell, 62 from Fochabers said to the Times Online that she was "calling [for help] from 8pm but no-one showed up until about midnight. All the time the river kept going up and up. They came with sandbags, but by then it was too late. The water was already in my house."The MSP for Moray Angus Robertson MP stated, "Water levels are higher than I have ever seen them before and communities have rallied to support people whose homes and businesses have been flooded. The objective must now be for everyone to help the victims of the worst flooding to hit Moray for many years to assist them rebuild their lives and get back to normality as quickly as possible. The hard lessons learnt from this latest devastation include the need for local agencies to redouble their efforts to get flood prevention measures into place and to recognise that climate change will only lead to more flooding in the future."At least 10 people have died due to flooding caused by torrential rains in Sindh, Pakistan. Floodwaters swept away a railway bridge about 80 km northwest of the port city of Karachi.Within an 18-hour spell of rain on Friday dumped up to 20 centimeters of water on the Sindh.Torrential rains that lashed southern parts of Pakistan's Sindh a couple of days ago have inundated cultivation territories, badly affecting the crops. The crops of banana, melon, betel leaf, chilli, onion and tomato suffered huge damage from the heavy rain. Due to LBOD overflowing, there is no another system in Sindh to drain out water from the damaged crops.File:Korangi Road Karachi.jpgTorrential rainstorms with gale force winds brought floods and destruction to Karachi, the capital of Sindh Province in Pakistan.Over 40 dead were recovered on Saturday and more than 180 on Sunday. Many more are said to have been injured by downed trees and power lines. Widespread power outages are reported as well as some rioting."We have declared an emergency at all government hospitals and cancelled the vacations and leave of doctors and paramedics," said the health minister for Sindh Province, Syed Sardar Ahmed, to AFP. "Now the total number of those killed because of rain is 228," he told Reuters.A state of emergency has been enacted in New Orleans in the U.S. state of Louisiana today, after the devastating Hurricane Katrina made landfall on Monday. There were earlier erroneous reports by the news media that martial law had been imposed. Mayor Ray Nagin fears that there may be "thousands" of fatalities in his city alone.Many hospital staff are struggling without power and  supplies. As many as 2,500 patients from hospitals in Orleans Parish were to be evacuated, according to US Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt, but where they could be sent was still uncertain.Looters are roaming the city and have already ransacked the city's upscale shopping district on Canal Street. They have been seen on news reports carrying huge bags of stolen goods. Governor Kathleen Blanco announced plans to completely shut down New Orleans and move everybody left there out of the area. A rescue helicopter was shot at, temporarily halting all rescue operations.Former mayor Marc Morial summed up his view by saying; "We've lost our city, I fear it's potentially like Pompeii."Two of the city's levees on Lake Ponchartrain failed; one with a football-field size breach.Emergency workers dropped sandbags from helicopters into the levee's breaches,but the water kept coming."It appears that now the bowl is beginning to fill -- not rapidly but slowly," said Walter Maestri, an emergency operations manager. New floods swept through the center of New Orleans and water now covers 80 percent of the city with broken gas lines feeding raging fires. In some locations the water is now at a depth of 20 feet (six meters).The famous French Quarter, initially less affected by flooding, finally also succumbed."Get out of town if you can." said Ed Freytag, a city worker at the temporary City Hall complex. "We're damn close right now to that worst-case scenario," said Dave Cohen, a local radio host.For those that were staying in the Superdome, officials have begun moving them to the long-vacant Astrodome in Houston, Texas.At approximately 8 p.m. EEST (1700 UTC) in Bahrain, a ferry that was believed to have been carrying about 150 tourists and locals was reported missing and overturned off the coast of Bahrain, near the Sheikh Khalifa Causeway Bridge, Sitra. The United States Fifth Fleet has been called in to help with the rescue.Earlier reports from Reuters stated that at least 40 bodies had been found, but ABC News reported that at least 44 are dead."There are 52 survivors and there are also 44 dead (bodies) that were retrieved. So far, the (rescue) operations continue. God willing, there will be more survivors rescued," said Bahrain's Interior Minister Abdulla Al Khalifa.One resident said, "I have seen at least 48 bodies," and ABC News reported at least 44 dead. However, "many on board were rescued," a Bahraini official was quoted as saying."The first report we received was that a Dhow (a wooden boat) has capsized. We are preparing a helicopter to join the rescue. There is no initial indication that this was an attack," said a U.S. Navy spokesman.Thirteen people have died after an Airlines PNG plane crashed in Papua New Guinea. The plane was carrying two local pilots as well as nine Australian, one Japanese and one Papua New Guinean passengers.The Twin Otter had been trying to land at Kokoda yesterday as Airlines PNG Flight CG4684, but had aborted once already. About ten minutes before it was due to land from its second approach it disapeared. The crash site was located today and is so inaccessable that two policemen were dropped into the jungle in order to hike to the scene and seek survivors. The search had been hampered by the same bad weather that had caused the aborted landing.Australian helicopter pilot David Inau has flown over the crash scene and commented that the plane appears to have "impacted head first into a sheer cliff face". The area is described Papuan Civil Aviation Authority head Joseph Kintau as "very, very difficult terrain".The tourists had been intending to hike along the Kokoda Trail, a route used by Australian soldiers fighting the Japanese during the second world war. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that "There is a horrible tragedy involved when families send off their loved ones for what they expect to be the experience of a lifetime only for it to turn into a tragedy such as this." The Australian military assisted in searching for the aircraft.Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Michael Somare commented on his own "great sadness" over the crash and promised a full investigation. "I have requested the ministers of the various responsible authorities to commence investigations into the accident and to furnish a report to cabinet," said Somare.The airline has also released a statement describing the pilots as "highly experienced" and commented that "Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected at this very difficult time."A two-hour gun battle which began at 7 p.m. local time between the Mexican Army and drug hitmen ended in 18 fatalities at the Mexican holiday resort of Acapulco on Saturday.Two soldiers and 16 gunmen were killed in the battle. The army was dispatched to follow up on an anonymous tip and were met by drug hitmen lobbing hand grenades and firing AK-47 type rifles."There were grenade and rocket explosions, and weapons like AK-47s. The fight lasted almost two hours," said an observer.Reinforcements who attempted to join the gunmen in the house were killed by army personnel.Gunmen attempting to flee from the gun battle were prevented doing so by a military Hummer.Following the battle, the army seized a huge arsenal of 36 large caliber rifles, 13 small-caliber shotguns, two grenade launchers, 13 hand grenades, 3,525 rounds of ammunition, 180 magazine charges and eight vehicles.Five people were placed under arrest. Between three and nine soldiers were injured along with three bystanders. 22 people were evacuated from the area following the battle including tourists, a family, the elderly, and a pregnant woman.Four Guerrero state police were found in the garage of the property who claim they had been kidnapped and held hostage. A colonel reported anonymously that their account was not confirmed.Local media reported that the gunmen were a part of the Beltran Leyva drug-trafficking gang who belong to the Sinaloa Cartel.Drug related violence has damaged tourism to the beach front resort city as well as economic investment in the area.  The recent H1N1 flu virus outbreak in Mexico which caused 89 deaths, the wearing of masks, school closures and an airport quarantine cost billions of dollars in lost tourism dollars at the end of April.Tourism destinations are offering discounted hotel rates to entice visiting tourists. Hotel Los Flamingos once owned by John Wayne and Tarzan's (Johnny Weissmuller) former home were neighboring tourism sites in the neighborhood of Saturday's gun battle.Acapulco, population over 600,000 is a city of the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 300 miles (483 km) southwest from Mexico City. Guerrero provides a main route for drug smugglers between South America and the United States.Mexico's president, Felipe Calderon, along with American President, Barack Obama, have initiated a crack down on drug gangs. Rival drug gang violence in Mexico has resulted in 2,300 fatalities in the first five months of this year.A freight train in Lviv, Ukraine derailed, caught fire, and spilled a toxic chemical, releasing dangerous fumes into the air early Tuesday morning (local time), and people who live near the site of the crash are still becoming sick. Officials say that the toxic cloud, surrounding at least 14 villages near the scene, is at least 23% above benign levels.So far 70 people, including 19 children, have been hospitalized after being poisoned by the fumes from train cars filled with yellow phosphorous. That number is up from the 15 seeking medical attention on Tuesday."I can say we have resolved the situation by extinguishing those tankers. Now we need to talk about dealing with the aftermath of this breakdown," said Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine's Prime Minister."This is a dangerous substance ... It is highly flammable and causes burns and choking," said Greenpeace Russia toxic gas expert, Alexei Kiselev.The European Union has stated that they will continue to monitor the gas cloud because toxic gas clouds do not "respect borders" of countries and will travel.The train was shipping cargo from Kazakhstan to Poland when it derailed. Authorities have ruled out sabotage and terrorism from playing a role in the crash and are still investigating the accident. At least 15 cars, of the 58 the train was pulling, derailed or were overturned.Water and local crops are said to not be affected by the chemical spill.At least 10,300 gallons of a toxic chemical, Cumene, also called isopropyl benzene, which is generally used in paint thinner, fuels, and rubber, spilled from a barge after it hit a wall of an underwater moveable dam in the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, according to the United States Coast Guard."There's a tremendous volume of water going through there, so there's a dilution factor, and this will be taken into consideration as they try to take measures to contain it," said a spokeswoman for the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Maggie Carson.The barge, which held at least 960,000 gallons of the chemical, hit the dam owned by Kirby Marine at Brookport, Illinois. The barge still blocks the river, leaving the waterway open to traffic going in one direction at a time for at least one mile on the river. Authorities have stated that the drinking water is okay to drink and that as of the moment the toxin has not been found in any water pumps in the area."I would say it's not particularly dangerous. Any spill is serious ... but my answer would be that there would not be a risk to human health," said a spokesperson for Kirby Marine, Mark Buese.It is not known what the environmental impact might be, but according to U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Wayne Chapman, the chemical floats on the surface of water so it will evaporate quickly.Exposure to the chemical can cause headaches, eye irritation, nose and throat irritation, as well as some dizziness. Any animals that have been exposed directly to the chemical could also be at risk.It is still not known what caused the crash.File:TragediaKatowice06.jpgThe roof of a trade hall in Metropolian Katowice (district Chorzów and Katowice), Poland has collapsed. Officials said there are at least 67 fatalities and at least 160 people were injured. More than 125 people are still believed to be trapped inside the building. "Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene, as people tried to break windows in order to get out. People were hitting the panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable. One of the panes finally broke, and they started to get out by the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.Victims have been transported to hospitals in the mining area.The trade hall was holding a pigeon exhibition [1] and the collapse is believed to have been caused by large amounts of snow on the roof. At least 500 people were believed to be inside when the roof collapsed.Jaroslaw Wojtasik a spokeman for the Katowice fire brigade said, "the weight of snow likely caused the roof to cave in at about 5:30 p.m., less than two hours before the event was scheduled to close for the evening.""From our crisis centres, we have found there are about 20 fatalities. We don't know if foreigners are among them," said Andrzej Gąska, spokesman for the regional police department.Rescuers are concerned that people trapped may die from hypothermia due to the freezing temperatures (currently about -15 degrees Celsius in Chorzów ).People standing outisde the building were helping rescuers and those that were injured into emergency vehicles.Two high-speed bullet trains crashed close to Wenzhou in the Zhejiang province of eastern China on Saturday. At least 43 passengers were found dead and over 200 are injured, according to the China state-run news agency Xinhua, with 12 in critical condition.The collision occurred on a bridge after one train was struck by lightning, forcing it to stop, and was subsequently struck by a second train around 2030 local time (1230 UTC). The trains involved were the D3115 service from Hangzhou to Fuzhou, the train that was stopped at the time of the collision, and the D301 service from Beijing to Fuzhou.As a result of the collision, two cars from the first train fell off the bridge, as well as four cars from the second train. One of the cars landed on its side, and another ended up lying vertically against the bridge. According to CCTV, a state-run broadcaster, upwards of 1,400 people were on the two trains: more than 900 on the stopped train and more than 500 on the second one.One passenger, Liu Hongtao, is reported as saying: "The train suddenly shook violently, casting luggage all around. Passengers cried for help but no crew responded."The government have said they will be launching an "urgent overhaul" of rail safety following the crash, the first derailment since the introduction of 155 miles per hour high-speed rail service in China four years ago, and three railway officials were also fired by the ministry of railways, which said the officials may be investigated.On Sunday, rescuers found a small child unconscious in the wreckage, about 21 hours after the crash, who was sent to a hospital.

He then came the the bridge and made the discovery, and called 9-1-1."It's tragic," Lieutenant Claycomb said. "There's no other way to put it."Chemicals in the Thompson River were said to be found after four Canadian Pacific Railway (CP Rail) cars containing chemicals derailed near Lytton, British Columbia, Canada on Tuesday night.The derailment occurred just northeast of Lytton when a landslide hit in the middle of a freight train with about 100 cars at around 7:00 pm PDT (02:00 UTC) Tuesday evening. One car remained on the tracks, another was on a river bank, and two were submerged in the Thompson, one of them fully submerged and the other partially submerged. CP states that the cars were carrying the chemical ethylene glycol, commonly found in products such as antifreeze and windshield washer fluid. Glycol is water soluble and biodegradable but is causing concern to local fisheries and people dependent on aquatic life survival. Even though there is not enough chemical to be toxic after dilution in the water, there is still expressed concern that it may cause additional stress to aquatic life.Despite protective measures, like a protective double hull, investigations found that broken valves and holes are causing the chemical to leak into the river. CP Rail originally denied that any chemical was leaking, but is now driving efforts to plug the leaks.The Thompson River is a tributary of the larger Fraser River. The area is sensitive to harm because migrating salmon pass through and are in already in dwindling numbers in recent years.A train has crashed into a bus in a suburb of Mexico City, the capital of Mexico.

The bus collided with the 36-carriage train as it crossed the tracks in the industrial area.The bus driver apparently misjudged the speed at which the train was traveling, thinking he could beat it across the level crossing.The bus driver was arrested following the crash, and according to officials, was trying to flee the scene. The train conductor was also detained for questioning. The train was pulling 36 empty wagons at the time on the incident.Juan Carlos Herrera, an emergency worker at the scene, said the casualties were all from Mexico.Belgian authorities have confirmed that at least eighteen people died in a head-on collision between two passenger trains in the suburbs of Brussels. Other reports suggest that the death toll could be as high as 25. More than 125 passengers are reported injured, 11 of them "very seriously". Rescuers were still trying to free bodies from the wreckage of the trains more than eight hours after the crash, which occurred in snowy conditions at 08:28 local time (0728 UTC) near the station of Buizingen in the municipality of Halle, about 15 kilometres southwest of the Belgian capital.One of the trains involved was travelling from Quiévrain to Liège, while the other was travelling from Leuven to Braine-le-Comte.  The collision saw the first two carriages of one train being forced upwards into the air over the first carriage of the second train.  Eyewitnesses described the collision as "brutal", with passengers being thrown "violently" around the carriages.Television footage showed the two smashed locomotives forced up in the air, with passenger cars strewn over a wide area and dazed survivors wandering at the crash site.  Train speed at the time of the crash was not immediately known.  There are reports that one of the trains ran a stop signal.Initial reports suggest that the Leuven–Braine-le-Comte train was on the wrong line. It is not known if the train went through a red signal or if there was a problem with the signalling. A "well informed source" quoted by French-language daily Le Soir suggested that there might have been an electrical failure in the signalling system.The collision occurred on one of the main access lines to Brussels-South station, about 14 kilometres (9 miles) from the Belgian capital. It caused "major damage" to overhead power cables, especially on the Brussels–Mons and Brussels–Tournai lines, and high speed rail services between Brussels and France and the UK have been suspended. Thalys services were temporarily halted due to the accident, with four of its trains in the region being diverted to alternative stations. Thalys services between Brussels and Cologne have now resumed, but services to Amsterdam and Paris are still suspended.One passenger on board, Christian Wampach, described conditions on board the train, "It was a nightmare.

Wampach was in the third car.Another passenger, Patricia Lallemand, said, "When we came out we saw dead bodies lying next to the tracks, some mutilated."Over 50 people have been injured today when two trains collided head-on at the Bet-Yehoshua station, near the city of Netanya on the railway from Tel Aviv to Haifa. Most of the injuries are minor, with no casualties or serious injuries reported in the media.The trains advanced slowly, one leaving the station and one entering it. One of the trains was completely derailed. The Israeli Railway Authority CEO said the accident was caused by a personal error of one of the conductors, but a police investigation is still ensuing. This is the second serious accident for Israeli trains within half a year. Four months ago, a train car derailed and burst in flames, injuring 79 people, most of the injuries due to inhaling of smoke. The Israel Railway Authority notified the passengers that the tracks from Tel Aviv to Haifa will be closed for at least a week, but later the company manager announced that rides would continue within 24 hours, while a fast and open investigation will follow. He promised that the results will be publicized immediately upon being received.At least 127 died early this morning when three trains crashed in a chain reaction in a station near Ghotki in the Sindh Province of Pakistan.

Emergency teams are working intensively on removing the wrecked engines from the line in order to provide suitable conditions for the resumption of traffic.From Washington D.C. to New York City, trains powered by overhead electric lines stalled for more than two hours due to what Amtrak called a "major power outage."  While working to restore power, Amtrak attempted to provide alternative transportation in the form of diesel locomotives and buses. Power was restored at 10:30 a.m. EDT. Delays continued for much of the day. Besides long-distance rail services such as Acela, local commuter trains were affected.  Seven SEPTA lines in the Philadelphia area were temporarily shut down, and five more ran shortened routes.  Also affected was Maryland's MARC and New Jersey Transit.No specific cause has been reported, but Amtrak's site indicates that they are investigating.A tram derailed on Thursday in the middle of the afternoon on the Boulevard Georges Favon, near Route du Stand, Geneva, causing major traffic jams. By chance, this spectacular incident caused three light casualties. Sometime after 15.42, amazed eyewitnesses saw the tram travel 30 metres across the road, then up the sidewalk. It came, at the closest, to around 30 cm from a shop window. The three casualties are suffering from whiplash injuries to the neck and back according to Raymond Wicky, head of the Service d'incendie et de secours (SIS; Fire and Help services). On the other hand, the driver was affected psychologically by the incident, as were several shop owners.Psychological assistance has been offered to them. Nine fire engines, two ambulances, and a dozen policemen and cars quickly arrived at the scene. A large security perimeter was placed around the immobilised tram whose length covered half of the road. Around a dozen onlookers assisted with the efforts made to move the tram from the road back onto its tracks. A truck then towed it back to its depot, where police and the Swiss Federal department of Transport are to examine the vehicle.Only a few elements that caused the derailment are known: the tram was on a line different to its normal route. Police will investigate whether the tram was travelling too fast, or if it was a faulty switch at the junction, which would have connected the tram to Rue du Stand, and then return it to normal route. Another element is that drivers have the possibility to change the switches in front of them. The inquiry will determine if the driver, wanting to turn here, chose to merge into his normal route and possibly, this caused the incident.ats/cabAn aircraft owned and operated by Transaven Airlines is believed to have crashed into the sea off the coast of Venezuela. 14 or 18 people were on board.The dual-engined Czechoslovakian-built (in 1987) Let L-410UVP-E3 plane had departed from Simon Bolivar International Airport near Caracas on its scheduled domestic flight to Los Roques Airport and is believed to have subsequently crashed into the ocean approximately 24 miles (39 km) short of its destination in the Los Roques archipelago, according to General Antonio Rivero, emergency management director for Venezuela. Initially, Bloomberg and Aviation Safety Network had reported that the plane had left the airport at Los Roques on its way to Caracas prior to the accident.Reuters reported that the crash was initially noticed when the plane failed to arrive at the Los Roques, according to air rescue worker Caleb Castro. Rivero told Reuters that four extra passengers had boarded at the last minute, bringing the total on board to 18.The Italian foreign ministry told reporters that eight of those on board were Italian, whilst Rivero's agency said the others were five Venezuelans and an American. The United States embassy said it had no information about details of their citizen on the flight, and a subsequent release said it was possible he or she was in fact Swiss.Search and rescue teams are using a navy frigate and patrol boats and helicopters to search for any survivors. "Speed boats, a plane and a helicopter are searching for the aircraft," Castro said to reporters.Luis Diaz, operations director for civil protection, said that the plane had reported engine trouble shortly before contact was lost. Although weather is not presently considered a factor, as conditions were good at the time, rains and high waves have developed and are hampering search efforts. Transaven have had two previous incidents, but no accidents. In 2002 a Transaven plane performed an emergency landing on water, in which all thirteen on board escaped uninjured. The other was a standard emergency landing in 2005. Both were on the same Caracas-Los Roques route.Transaven, a small local company, regularly flies to Los Roques, a national park and a popular tourist destination boasting white sand beaches and world-class scuba-diving sites.Amid the confusion surrounding today's London blasts, officials have urged the public to avoid the city if possible to allow emergency services to operate more quickly.All rail and underground stations remain closed, although efforts are being made to reopen them. Air links are now closed at Stansted, Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports.Those trying to contact friends and family via mobile have struggled as the largest mobile networks, Vodafone, O2 and Orange, have all suffered from full capacity on several occasions this morning meaning voice calls failed. On the web, websites such as BBC, TfL and the G8 2005 website struggled for a short time at one point this morning under the strain of so many web users visiting them. The national grid has said that it has sustained no damage to the electricity network.On the Traffic England site run by the Highways Agency, London has been marked as a 'Closed area'.The Royal Mail is warning customers that mail collections and deliveries across the UK will be disrupted because of the incidents.  Royal Mail vehicles will not be moving in or out of London, or between Royal Mail sites in central London for the remainder of today.  At least 25 per cent of the UK's mail moves through London, even if its end destination is elsewhere.  Disruption may therefore be felt throughout the UK.  Royal Mail expects to issue further information later today.Bus services in Zone 1 have resumed as of  16:00 BST.Twenty-three people died when a Transrapid maglev train travelling on the system's test track in Lathen in Germany, near the Netherlands border, collided with a maintenance vehicle on the track. Ten others were severely injured according to Karl-Heinz Brüggemann, a spokesman for the rescue effort.The driverless train was estimated as operating at 170 km/h (105 mph) when the accident occurred around 09:30 local time (07:30 UTC). The unmanned train, with 31 passengers aboard crashed into a maintenance wagon containing 2 workers.German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the site to pay her respect to the victims and the rescuers.The train had traveled about 1 km (0.6 miles) from its departure station when it struck the maintenance vehicle.  Debris from the accident was spread over a 300 m (984 ft) section of track. Police spokesman Hans Kley confirmed that the Transrapid train did not leave the track, which is elevated approximately 5 metres (16 ft) above the ground. Other reports indicate that the train's roof was torn off in the collision. Rescue workers used ladder trucks from local fire departments to evacuate the stopped train. On hearing of the accident, Germany's Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee suspended his trip in China and made preparations to return to Germany to view the accident scene.The 31.8 km (20 mile) test system in Germany was built by a consortium of Siemens AG and ThyssenKrupp.  It has been in operation since 1984 and is regularly used by tour groups for demonstration runs four days per week. Transrapid trains are capable of speeds up to 450 km/h (280 mph).  This accident is the first on the system that included fatalities; analysts so far attribute the cause of the accident to a lack of communications between the train operators and the maintenance employees. The only commercial installation of Transrapid technology in service is currently the Shanghai Maglev Train linking Shanghai Metro Line 2's Longyang Road station to Pudong International Airport.Two miners trapped since Tuesday in the Beaconsfield Mine in Tasmania, Australia, have reportedly been found alive by rescuers. Todd Russell and Brandt Webb were trapped by a rockfall caused by a minor earthquake on Tuesday night. Hopes for their survival had faded after the body of a fellow trapped miner, Larry Knight, was discovered on Thursday.According to the mine's owners, the men are located in the mine where they were last seen, over 900m below the surface. Rescuers are communicating with, but still unable to free, the trapped men, and will be supplying them with food and water. It could be up to 48 hours before the men are extracted from the mine.Two people have been killed as the result of a collision involving a vehicle crashing into a tree in Oxfordshire, England.  The two occupants of the Subaru Impreza were four-year-old Bradley Eldridge and his father, 36-year-old Tony Eldridge, who was driving the vehicle.  Both were thought to be from the village of Bicester.The vehicle was travelling between the Oxfordshire villages of Bicester and Bucknell at around 20:15 GMT on Wednesday when it departed from the road and crashed into a tree. Both occupents of the car were declared dead at the scene of the collision.A rapid response ambulance had been directed to the crash site, however, a spokesperson for the South Central Ambulance Service stated that "[s]adly, there was nothing that the crews could do." The spokesperson also commented that "[a]n adult male and a four-year-old child were declared dead at the scene and our crew was stood down."A spokesperson for the Thames Valley Police was quoted as saying: "A police officer came across the vehicle while out on patrol. It was a significant impact and he immediately raised the alarm before going to the aid of the occupants. It is unclear at this stage when the accident happened but it is not believed to have been long before it was found."Relentless drought and record-high temperatures are taking their toll on trees in and around Houston, Texas. Experts estimate as much as 10% of all trees in the area are either dead or dying. Urban Forester Victor Cordova said, "We water in the morning. We go back and check and it's like we didn't even water. The air, the humidity, the heat just sucks up the moisture." Officials say young trees are in greatest danger; approximately 20,000 trees planted since January are at risk. Along portions of the North Freeway, workers have been removing dry trees. "At a point we have to go back to the survival of the fittest. Whatever makes it, makes it and whatever doesn't, doesn't", Cordova reported.Last year's Hurricane Ike may have also played a role in killing the plants. Up to 64,000 trees in the Houston area might be lost by the end of this year. However, those planted by the Texas Department of Transportation are still under warranty, and are replaced at no cost to taxpayers.Ernesto, now a tropical storm, made landfall along the coastline of the state of North Carolina near Long Beach in Brunswick County at 11:40 p.m. eastern time.Reports say the storm was near hurricane strength when it made landfall, but officials are welcoming the rain."We need some rain around here - just not all at once," said Jean Evans, a worker for a convienence store in North Carolina's Holden Beach.The threat of flooding is the main concern, said meteorologists."The storm system is moving quite fast, and it's bringing a lot of moisture with it. You always have flash flooding with these types of systems in the mid-Atlantic because of mountainous terrain. People really need to monitor that. You don't want to go through standing water or running water because you don't know how deep it is," said meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, Jennifer Pralgo.Hurricane watches have been activated in from South Santee River in South Carolina to Cape Lookout in North Carolina, but all watches located south of Santee River are no longer in effect.There is no word on any serious damage as of yet.    As the storm moved northward into Virginia, eastern portions of the state received up to as much as a foot rain. Flash flood watches were in effect there, and further up the U.S. coastline, including areas of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and central New York.Tropical Storm Adrian, the first named storm of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season, formed 440 miles (710 km) southwest of Guatemala and El Salvador on Tuesday.  The storm is expected to track northeast towards Central America. The government of El Salvador has upgraded the tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch for all of El Salvador. A tropical storm watch remains in effect for the entire Pacific coast of Guatemala.  The government of Honduras has issued a tropical storm watch for the Pacific coast of Honduras, including the Gulf of Fonseca.As of 11 am Pacific Time on Thursday, it was moving northeast at 9 mph (15 km/h) with maximum sustained wind speeds of 75 mph (120 km/h), with gusts at higher speeds. It is expected to strengthen slightly, possibly becoming a minimal hurricane at landfall.The current location of the center of the storm is 12.6° N, 90.6° W; about 120 miles (195 km) southwest of San Salvador, El Salvador.Additional strengthening is expected over the next 24 hours.  Outer rain-bands containing gusty winds and locally heavy rainfall are already affecting the coastal areas of Guatemala, and should begin affecting El Salvador tonight. Rainfall accumulation of 6 to 10 inches, with isolated higher amounts of up to 20 inches in the mountains, can be expected in association with Adrian. This system also has the potential to produce torrential rainfall over other portions of Central America during the next few days, triggering flash flooding and mudslides. Storm surge flooding of 2 to 4 feet above normal tide level is possible near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.Meteorologists expect the storm to be in the Caribbean by Friday.Tropical Storm Danielle, fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph). Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday. As the storm is far from landfall, it remains difficult to assess potential impact to the United States or Caribbean.The storm formed near the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa, being classified as Tropical Depression Six. It then developed into a more organized cyclone moving eastward. Forecast models show it will stay on an eastward track, later turning to the Northeast. If the models are correct, Danielle will avoid any landfall across the Eastern United States.Meteorologists predict that Danielle will be the first of several storms to form within the next two weeks, as the Atlantic Hurricane season is currently at its peak. "There are signs that the Atlantic is acting like it should in August and September. We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season," said Rick Knabb of the Weather Channel.Even though the 2010 season seems to be one with low activity, emergency officials are still stressing safety and awareness to residents in hurricane-prone areas. "It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage. Hurricane Andrew was a catastrophic Category 5 storm that came during a year when it was a lower-than-average season.Seventeen people in Guatemala have been killed by Tropical Storm Dolly, the fourth storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. This included twelve people from a family from Zacapa, who died when a hill collapsed on their home. The home collapse in Zapaca killed all but three of the people who were in the home at the time of the collapse. Nine children were among those who died.In Huehuetenango, a landslide killed all four people inside a house.Angel Antonio Diaz, another person who died, drowned while attempting to cross the river Punilá.The Guatemalan National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology (INSIVUMEH) said that the storms will continue throughout the rest of today and tomorrow. According to INSIVUMEH, most of Guatemala will continue to experience winds and rain, and the Pacific coast will experience thunderstorms.Just as Hurricane Dennis dissipated over the mid-west United States on Monday, Tropical Storm Emily formed in the mid-Atlantic. Its current location is 11.1° N, 52.8° W, about 475 miles (765 km) east-southeast of Barbados.The storm is currently moving west at a rate of 13mph/20kph. It is expected to make a slight turn to the north-northwest on Tuesday. Maximum sustained winds are currently at 45mph/75kph.Hurricane watches have been issued for Barbados, Grenada, The Grenadines, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia.Tropical Storm Epsilon formed today as the record breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season comes to a close tomorrow. Storms created after this date will still be included in the 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season but it is not officially under the date.  The storm is the 26th storm in a season that has broken many records including number of storms.The storm formed 845 miles (1,360 km) east of Bermuda. According to forecasters, the storm is only a threat to shipping. At 10am EST, the storm had sustained winds of 45 mph. The storm is moving west at 8 mph and is expected to continue that movement for 24 hours.The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season broke many records including number of storms and number of Category 5 hurricanes and number of tropical storms that evolved into hurricanes. Although the season ends tomorrow, forecasters warn that tropical storms can form in December.Tropical Storm Ernesto has weakened over Florida. It is expected to make another landfall on the North Carolina coast as a tropical storm. Ernesto came ashore early this morning in the Florida Keys with less intensity than expected by forecasters.  The storm had weakened to a tropical depression as it moved up the Florida peninsula. It is expected to go to Charleston, South Carolina. Tropical storm watches have been issued for Savannah, Georgia, to Morehead City, North Carolina. At 5 p.m. local time (2100 GMT), Ernesto's sustained winds were about 35 mph (56 kph), as stated by the National Hurricane Center. The center of the system was still over Florida, about 55 miles (90 km) south-southwest of Cape Canaveral.Forecasters say Ernesto could regain tropical storm status with peak winds exceeding 40 miles (64 kilometers) an hour."Ernesto has the potential to regain tropical storm strength on Thursday over the Atlantic," the hurricane center said.Two deaths were reported in separate wrecks in Florida.Snakes and alligators have been forced out onto Florida streets in the United States as Tropical Storm Fay continues to flood the state, breaking the region's two-year drought. The storm has already left over two feet of rain along Florida's central Atlantic coast with more still to come.About 60,000 homes have lost power and schools have been closed. On Thursday President George W. Bush issued a federal disaster declaration that allows for the Department of Homeland Security to use federal funds to pay for 75% of the debris removal costs.Gary Redwine of Merritt Island near Cape Canaveral was so sick of waiting inside he hopped in a kayak to tour around the neighbourhood to inspect the debris. "It's the only dry way to get around. It's not like you can go jogging or anything," the 49-year-old said to Associated Press.At 5 a.m. EDT (UTC-4) Fay was moving west at 6 mph (~10 km/h) and forecast to gradually weaken. Florida Governor Charlie Crist commented, "This storm has been hanging around and hanging around and hanging around, and she's going to be around for a while longer."State climatologist David Zierden told the Los Angeles Times that the reason for the rain is that Fay is a "slow moving system" which has drawn water from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Several thousand homes have been damaged by the flooding. The National Guard helped to evacuate some residents. Aside from the flooding, Tropical Storm Fay has been beneficial for the water table, according to district spokesman Randy Smith.Tropical Storm Fung-wong made landfall in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, at about 7:35 p.m local time (1135 UTC) yesterday, bringing with it reportedly 100kph (60mph) winds and heavy rains.China prepared for the storms by recalling nearly 33,000 ships and boats to port, and the preemptive evacuation of over 250,000 people from vulnerable areas. Fung-Wong was moving inland, northwards and eastwards, and as it did so wind speeds and the possibility of wind damage should diminish however it should continue to present a flooding risk. The storm was expected to hit Shanghai today, and around 100,000 people were placed on standby to deal with possible flooding. Fung-wong should also lead to heavy rain in Japan and South Korea bringing with it the threat of flash floods.Prior to hitting China, Fung-wong had previously landed in Taiwan and the Philippines, leading directly to one death in Taiwan. Philippine officials said flooding and strong winds caused a minimum of ten deaths in the Philippines, with about 200,000 people displaced from their homes.Dante, a tropical storm in Southeast Asia, has killed at least eleven people and displaced tens of thousands in the Philippines.Government authorities reported that nine persons were missing after a mudslide resulting from the storm in the coastal village of Maganelles.Regional disaster official Bernardo Alejandro said that the army and police were using shovels to search for the missing people, who are feared to have been buried in the mudslide. Nine persons, among them two children, have been found. According to Alejandro, the other casualties were a fisherman who drowned off the coast of the Camarines Norte province and a man who attempted to ford a swollen creek and drowned.Meanwhile, 45,000 people were evacuated into school shelters from their residences near the Mayon volcano, following concerns that mudslides may begin in the area.According to a government weather meteorologist, Manny Mendoza, the typhoon was estimated to have sustained maximum winds of 95 kilometres per hour, with gusts of up to 120 kph. At last report, it is predicted to be about 110 kilometres off the northeastern coast of the islands.Typhoons are not rare in the Philippines; an average of 20 storms strike the area every year. This storm, however, was unusual because it hit in the middle of the Philippine summer, while most typhoons appear only after June. Alejandro said that global warming, which may have caused weather patterns to change, could have been the reason for the unusual occurrence.In an advisory issued late Sunday night, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded Tropical Storm Humberto to hurricane status, making it the third hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. Humberto, now officially Hurricane Humberto, is a category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday night had no associated hurricane watches or warning.The NHC's Hurricane Humberto Advisory Number 14, released at 11:00 p.m. EDT on Sunday (0300 UTC Monday morning) placed Humberto 785 miles (1260 kilometers) west of Bermuda. According to data collected by one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's "Hurricane Hunters", Humberto had maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (120 kilometers per hour) and was moving northeast at 3 mph (6 kph).On Saturday, Humberto hovered to the east of Great Abaco Island for a few hours, but once it moved on the Bahamian government withdrew its tropical storm warnings. According to the Miami Herald, Humberto is not expected to make landfall in the United States or in the Bahamas. The NHC, as of Sunday night, had no outstanding hurricane warnings.Tropical Storm Humberto was the eighth named storm of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, and became its third hurricane. Forming in July 2019, Hurricane Barry was the first hurricane of the season, and it was followed by Hurricane Dorian in late August.Tropical storms and hurricanes are both forms of tropical cyclones. On the Saffir–Simpson scale, which is used by the NHC for classifying tropical cyclones, category 1 hurricanes must sustain winds of at least 74 miles per hour. The cut-off for a category 2 hurricane, the next stronger classification, is 119 mph.Tropical Storm Irene, recently downgraded from a hurricane, passed over New York City at about 0900 local time (1300 UTC) today, bringing heavy rain and winds up to 65 miles per hour (96.6 km/h).Flooding has been reported in New York City, where the Hudson River spilled over its banks into Manhattan and the East River briefly flooded. Floods were also reported in Brooklyn. Water was reported to be inside Battery Park and near the New York Mercantile Exchange. The water level of New York Harbor is as much as four feet higher than normal, with a predicted storm surge of up to eight feet.Elsewhere in the northeast, suburbs of Philadelphia also flooded; mayor Michael Nutter described the scene in one area as "couches, furniture, all kinds of stuff floating down the street."Up to eleven people have been reported killed by the storm, five in North Carolina, three in Virginia and one each in Florida, Maryland and Connecticut.  Some three million people evacuated from areas expected to be impacted by the storm, and another three million are reported to be without power.Irene made landfall in North Carolina on Saturday, bringing up to fourteen inches (~36 cm) of rain and a storm surge measuring four feet in the Cheasapeake Bay with it. At about 0530 local time today, the storm made its second landfall as it passed over Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey.According to New Jersey governor Chris Christie, the storm is expected to cause damage "in the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars."Tropical Storm Isaac is creating a swathe of concerns across many gulf states in the US, as it sweeps into the Florida Keys.As of 5:00pm EDT, Miami area winds were measuring at 60 miles per hour. Authorities indicated 5,180 homes across Broward county are without electricity. According to media sources, the governor of Louisiana anticipates giving evacuation orders as early as Monday morning.Hurricane warnings have been issued in the Florida Panhandle, sweeping as far west as Louisiana. Sunday afternoon, Louisiana's Governor Jindal issued a state of emergency for the state. Over 450 flights at Miami International Airport were canceled this weekend, in light of the storm's arrival.Ultimately, the storm's winds could reach as high as 110 mph, according to sources. The mayor of New Orleans told media that many residents there are nervous. The last time a hurricane struck the Gulf coast was in 2008.As of 11:30 a.m. EDT on August 26 (1530 UTC), the center of Hurricane Katrina was located over the Gulf of Mexico about 45 miles (70 km) northwest of Key West, and 75 miles (120 km) south-southwest of Naples, Florida. The storm was reported moving southwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) with maximum sustained winds of approximately 100 mph (160 km/h) with higher gusts.Katrina is expected to strengthen further, likely to at least a Category 3 hurricane and possibly a Category 4 hurricane, as it curves north towards a final landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast.Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 70 miles from the center.The minimum central pressure recently observed by an air force reserve unit reconnaissance aircraft was  981 mb or 28.97 inches.Due to its slow forward speed, Katrina is expected to produce a significant heavy rainfall event over the central and northwest Bahamas as well as south Florida Total rainfall accumulations of 6 to 12 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 15 to 20 inches are possible.Storm surge flooding of 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels, along with large and dangerous battering waves, can be expected near the center in areas of onshore winds in the Bahamas.Vietnamese media reported on Wednesday that at least 90 people have been killed after Tropical Storm Mirinae passed through the country. Another 22 people were reported to be missing.According to Vietnam News, the storm completely destroyed 154 houses, damaged 2,500 others, and flooded 1,800 hectares of farmland. Some dikes in the Phu Yen province were overloaded with water, further exacerbating the damage.Around 2,000 soldiers were dispatched to assist with rescue efforts, and local authorities had asked for food aid from the government.The Vietnamese disaster committee said that "it's the most devastating flooding in more than 30 years in Phu Yen."Two people were also killed by Mirinae in neigbouring Cambodia, and a further 27 in the Philippines.The death toll for Tropical Storm Olga reached 38 on Friday. The rare December tropical storm, which disintegrated into a mass of thunderstorms late on Wednesday, killed two people, a woman and a 3-year-old boy, in Haiti. In the Dominican Republic, 12 Hatians drowned. Olga's torrential rains were also blamed for mudslides that killed a man in Puerto Rico. 4,000 hetchacres of crops and $40 million in revenues have been destroyed. The highest winds recorded were 60 miles per hour. This storm was the fifteenth in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.On December 10, the Tropical Prediction Center issued a gale warning for waters north of the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, in association with the precursor disturbance to Olga. Upon it being classified as a subtropical cyclone, the government of the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Cabo Engaño along the north coast to its border with Haiti; a tropical storm watch was also issued along the southern coastline to near Santo Domingo. Because winds were well to the north of its center, a tropical storm warning was not issued for Puerto Rico. Prior to it moving ashore, the government of Haiti issued a tropical storm warning for its northern coastline, and later a tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands, as well as the southeastern Bahamas.Hurricane Otto has been downgraded to a tropical storm, and is expected to move northeast into the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend. Otto is the seventeenth Atlantic tropical cyclone and fifteenth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed out of a previously subtropical storm after undergoing full tropical cyclogenesis.The National Hurricane Center, which is responsible for tracking and predicting the likely behavior of tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes, has reported that the storm will move away from land, lose its tropical character and decrease its speed, possibly by Sunday evening. It is expected to move across the Azores and toward the coast of Portugal and Eastern Europe. At 5 pm EDT Otto was about 710 miles from Bermuda and moving northeast at a speed of 32 mph. Hurricane winds are extending for approximately 35 miles, tropical winds extending 220 miles. Forecasters have reported no warnings. The NHC said: "Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days. Conventional and microwave satellite imagery indicate Otto is quickly coming unraveled." Channel 6 News reported that at 11 a.m. EDT on Saturday the center of Hurricane Otto was located about 880 km (545 miles) east of the British overseas territory of Bermuda, and the storm was speeding to the northeast near 46 km (29 miles) per hour. Todd Kimberlain, a NHC forecaster, has said Otto is expected to move northeastwards as before during the next 24 to 36 hours in between a large deep-layer trough over the northwest Atlantic and a subtropical ridge to its east.Earlier this year, Colorado State University hurricane expert Dr. Phil Klotzbach told Wikinews that he expected a very active hurricane season. "At this point, we expect this year will be much more active [than] last year. Last year was only characterized by nine named storms, 3 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes. Our most recent prediction is that this year will have 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes," he said. "If a storm does threaten [your area] during the hurricane season, the important thing to do is to listen to local emergency management and follow their advice," he added.Tropical Storm Richard formed in the western Caribbean Thursday and is currently moving slowly westward towards Honduras. A gradual motion to the west is expected later on, and the tropical storm is forecast to impact Honduras and then the Yucatan Peninsula. As a result, several watches and warnings are in effect for Honduras from its border with Nicaragua west to Limón and the Bay islands. Richard currently sustains winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and is expected to strengthen further, possibly into a hurricane by Saturday. Richard has dumped heavy rains over Jamaica and is expected to produce rainfall in Honduras, then trek towards the Yucatan Peninsula and enter the Gulf of Mexico.Richard has already caused widespread flooding across western parishes of Jamaica, which is currently under a flash flood watch. A hurricane watch and tropical storm warning are in effect for the north coast of Honduras from the Nicaragua/Honduras border westward to Limón to the Bay islands. A hurricane watch is in effect for eastern Mexico from Gruesa to Chetumal. There is also a tropical storm watch up for Belize and a tropical storm warning for Honduras from Limón westward to the Guatemala border. Richard is not expected to be a threat to oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.Tropical storm Richard is nearing hurricane strength with winds of 70 mph (115 kph) as it lashes Honduras with heavy rains. Richard is expected to pass just north of Honduras and strike Belize and Mexico late Sunday as a hurricane.Richard is about 85 mi (140 km) east of Isla Guanaja Honduras and is expected to move further westward paralleling the coast of Honduras. Honduras and Belize are currently under a hurricane warning and the Mexican government has begun to evacuate fishermen from the Yucatán Peninsula, which is under a tropical storm warning, as strong winds and rain are expected over the next 24 hours. Honduran officials have evacuated residents and tourists from coastal areas. "[We will] evacuate between 3,000 and 4,000 people that live in coastal zones where there could be a storm surge and heavy winds," a Honduran emergency response official, Randolfo Funez, said. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) released a statement, which said: "A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the northern coast of Honduras and Belize...and 1 to 3 feet in the bay islands. Near the coast...the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves." They also advised that life threatening flash floods and landslides are possible, especially in mountainous areas in the storm's path.Richard is likely to plow through Belize and the Yucatán Peninsula before emerging into the Bay of Campeche as a tropical depression on Tuesday according to the Miami based National Hurricane Center. Some computer module forecasts have Richard affecting Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas rigs.Full Wikinews coverage of the 2010 hurricane seasonThe National Hurricane Center Tropical Prediction Center has upgraded Tropical Depression Twenty to Tropical Storm status.  The storm, now officially Tropical Storm Stan, is the 18th named storm of the 2005 hurricane season.  The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour.  Stan is located 50 miles SSE of Progreso, Mexico, and is currently tracking WNW at 12 miles per hour.The storm is expected to weaken as it crosses the Yucatan Peninsula, then strengthen again when it encounters the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  Current projections show that by 1:00 pm Tuesday, October 4, it may reach Hurricane strength before making landfall on the central portion of the Mexican coast.All individuals who may be impacted by this storm are urged to track its progress as it develops over the next few days.A truck on the Trans-Canada Highway in New Brunswick, Canada, carrying 12 million bees has overturned. The truck was carrying 330 crates of bees when it tipped on a ramp in Saint-Léonard. The bees were used to help pollinate blueberries, and were heading back to Ontario.The accident happened in the morning hours. Bee experts were called in to control the bees, and they were helped by the rain as bees dislike it, with the bees staying close to the truck. However, by midday, the sun came out and the bees became much more agitated. The beekeepers had to douse them with smoke, while firefighters attempted to hose the bees down to try to get them back near the truck. There were no serious injuries from the incident, but some reporters at the scene got stung repeatedly. Anyone with an allergy to bees has been advised to stay at least 200 metres away from the scene.The highway was first reduced to three lanes from four, before being completely closed, to prevent curious onlookers from being endangered by the swarms of bees angered and agitated by the incident.This accident was the first of its kind in New Brunswick.A truck carrying 35,500 pounds (16,100 kg) of explosives used in mining and seismic exploration overturned and exploded on a rural mountain section of U.S. Highway 6 in Utah's Spanish Fork Canyon Thursday afternoon.The wreck occurred shortly after 2 pm, as driver Travis Stewart, 30, of Rexburg, Idaho, was leaving Ensign-Bickford Co., a commercial explosives manufacturing plant at the mouth of the canyon. Company officials said the truck was destined for Oklahoma.  Witnesses said Mr. Stewart appeared to lose control of the truck after entering a curve in the road at a high rate of speed. Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Ken Peay said, "speed was a factor" in the wreck of the truck but refused to speculate on how fast the truck was traveling when it wrecked. Lt. Peay said the posted speed limit on the road is 60 mph, but the advised speed is 40.At least 17 people received minor injuries and the explosion left a 35 foot deep crater in the highway. The driver was transported via helicopter to a hospital, where he was listed in fair condition, and was later released. The co-driver Troy Lysfjord, 37, of Blackfoot, Idaho, was helped from the wreck by passers by and listed in fair condition at Utah Valley Regional Hospital in Provo.The wreck site occurred on a major thoroughfare between Denver and Salt Lake City - about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City - was already under reconstruction by nightfall, as road crews began installing 10 inches of asphalt on the two lane road. Utah Department of Transportation spokesman Tom Hudachko said officials hoped to have the road fully repaired by Friday afternoon, adding that, "When you take a look at that hole that was there 24 hours ago, I think it's amazing the progress that was made." As of press time, the mouth of the canyon was reopened to traffic, while traffic at the accident site was impassible, and rerouted nearby. The explosion consumed all but about 60 pounds of explosives, and loosened some boulders on the north side of the highway, damaged railroad tracks and some fiber optic lines buried along the roadway. Amtrak and Union Pacific reported delays resulting from the wreck. Uinta National Forest spokesman Loyal Clark said forest firefighters were unable to respond to several small fires nearby that were apparently started by flying debris, and that helicopters dropped water to extinguish them. High humidity and lack of fuel from a previous fire delayed the fire's spread.The cost of repairs, while paid immediately by the state, will ultimately be borne by the trucking company's insurance carrier. The truck is registered to R&R Trucking of Duenweg, Missouri. UHP Lt. Peay said the investigation findings will be turned over to Utah County Attorney Kay Bryson whom would make any final decision about what charges, if any, would be pressed.A pickup truck crashed into a traditional Indian wedding procession in Abbotsford, British Columbia on Friday. Six people are dead and at least 17 more were injured.The crash occurred on Lefeuvre Road near King Road where the pedestrians were heading towards the bride's house. Reports indicate the truck driver was traveling northbound when he and his vehicle came up behind the group and collided with many of them. Police have not yet decided whether to lay charges as they continue their investigation. Police interviewed the 71-year-old driver, who was uninjured.A garbage truck in downtown Toronto crashed in a sink hole next to a construction site. The truck sank beneath a roadway Friday morning after the pavement gave way into a large sink hole.The driver is safe, suffering only from a sudden fright. The truck went down so quickly that the driver was forced to jump out about seven feet as the rear end of his vehicle crashed through at an angle."He was very frightened, he was distressed, definitely," said a police officer at the scene shortly after the accident. "He said it sank quite rapidly in the beginning and it is actually continuing to sink."Engineers had to wait more than 12-hours to give approval to tow the truck out. "From what we can tell there isn't a water main at this location," city engineer Maurizio Barbon said.Engineers described a hole similar in size to a small backyard swimming pool.It will take a few more days to find out what caused the sink hole.More than fifteen people were killed near the police station in Yerpedu, Andhra Pradesh, India after a heavily loaded truck lost control on Friday afternoon at about 1:45 P.M. IST (0815 UTC).People, mostly from the village of Munagalapalem, were gathered to protest local illegal sand mining. The truck hit an electric pole, and destroyed nearby shops and vehicles causing a short-circuit and fire. Tirupati Urban Superintendent of Police R Jayalakshmi said the truck crushed some people under its wheels; six people were killed that way according to Renigunta deputy superintendent KS Nanjndappa. Other people died due to the short circuit and the fire. More than fifteen people were injured including the police station's chief inspector and the sub-inspector. Reportedly at least ten were in a critical condition.The driver fled after the accident. Victims were taken to hospitals in Tirupati, and Chennai and Vellore in Tamil Nadu. N Chandrababu Naidu, Andhra's Chief Minister, said via Twitter, "State Cabinet has announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh [0.5 million] to the families of the deceased."The tsunami alert issued for certain areas of Russia and Japan after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck near the north coast of Japan have been lifted. While the tsunami alert has been lifted, Japan's Meteorological Agency's web site is still showing watches in affect for most of the eastern Pacific coast of Hokkaido.A small 40cm (15.7 inches) wave did wash up in some areas of the eastern coast of Japan, but this was nowhere near the 200cm (6.5 feet) wave that had been feared.New figures on the Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster death toll have been released by Indonesia's National Disaster Relief Coordination Agency. It confirms 126,473 dead and 93,943 missing in Indonesia, the worst hit nation by far.The tsunami was the result of an undersea earthquake near the northern tip of Sumatra (in Indonesia) on December 26. The waves struck as far away as Tanzania on Africa's east coast. According to Sri Lanka's Centre for National Operations, it was the second hardest-hit by the disaster with 30,957 dead, with another 5,637 people listed as missing.According to SBS World News today, the total dead and missing for all eleven countries damaged by the tsunami now stands at 282,517. figures from SBS World News March 24, 2005* Aid workers claim this figure to be inflated.Over a thousand Europeans were killed in the disaster. Mostly holiday-makers, of those lost it is estimated that one third were German. Another 1,100 were listed as missing.After a magnitude 8.7 earthquake rocked Sumatra late Monday, local populations were reminded of the devastating tsunamis of December 26, 2004, that killed 273,000 people as they scoured the shores and seaside areas of countries exposed to the Indian Ocean, although three hours later with only one small tsunami observed the threat had passed.Still, according to reports, thousands of coastal residents near the Indian Ocean were evacuating to higher ground for the night in case the experts were wrong. Reports also say Sri Lankan authorities urged islanders near the coast to move at least two kilometres inland."It looks like many people have left the coasts. I don’t know exactly how many people but they are moving away from the sea shores to the interior areas," Dr. Unni Krishnan, coordinator for relief agency Action Aid said in an interview with a reporter from The Scotsman.Minutes after data from the earthquake started coming in, half-way around the world from Sumatra, an emergency response center kicked into action. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued a tsunami alert - advising "immediate action" and evacuation procedures were advised for some coastal areas."Authorities in those regions should be aware of this possibility and take immediate action. This action should include evacuation of coasts within 1,000 kilometers of the epicenter and close monitoring to determine the need for evacuation further away," the PTWC alert said.The PTWC said they did detect a small tsunami that stuck the Cocos Islands south of the quake's epicenter. However the PTWC went on to say that if no tsunami activity was observed within three hours of the 4.10pm UTC quake, there was no further danger. That time has passed.A spokesman for the United States Geological Service in an interview with the AFP said when such a large quake strikes, the U.S. government sends out e-mails, faxes and telephone messages to nearby agencies warning them of possible aftershocks, or likely tsunami activity.The nations hard hit by last year's devastating tsunami are now lending advice to the United States on how to cope with the Katrina crisis. Nopadol Somboonsub, the head of tsunami corpse identification in Thailand noted that the U.S. needs to "...examine the bodies slowly and put all the data into a computer," and added that "It's very important to get it right. You cannot assume that this or that body is the right body simply because a relative identified it." Somboonsub noted that life insurance and identity theft fraud are all matters to consider when dealing with body identification.  Somboonsub speaks from a position of experience, his team having dealt with the identities of 5,395 corpses of various ethnicities in Thailand.In India too, experts have advice for the U.S. For instance, one unnamed Indian official said that nations should not be arrogant when it comes to handling disasters. He also stated that "In India, for all its vastness, we have a very easily operable contingency plan for disasters at the grassroots level. It is not a highly complicated national response system."He emphasized that relief is most important on the local level: "A person at the grassroots level knows that sandbags have to be organized, identifies likely places of breaches, plans clearing debris and setting up relief camps and cooking centers."In Aceh, in Indonesia, Budi Atmadi, head of relief operations, said that humanitarian concerns must come first."In that period, the blame game is rampant because one person will always say the relief has been slow while another says there are so many limitations. The blame game will always be there so your ears need to be thick," Atmadi stated, along with "The important thing is to stay committed and put humanitarian concerns at the top."The United States has so far only accepted help from other countries in the form of monetary aid and oil.Following a magnitude 8.3 earthquake in the Pacific Ocean, Japan's Meteorological Agency has issued a Tsunami warning for the north-eastern coast of Hokkaido and a lesser warning for Honshu. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning centre has issued a warning for Russia, Japan and Markus, Wake, Midway and Marianas islands.A tsunami wave alert for the outer coast of British Columbia has been dropped. It was lifted about three hours after the alert was issued.The alert was issued at 4:10 a.m. PST for B.C. north and central coasts to the northern tip of Vancouver Island and also the west coast of Vancouver Island south to Sombrio Point. It was expected to hit at 9:00 a.m. PST, 12:00 p.m. ET."That's our latest information - that if a wave was generated it would be hardly noticeable," said Cam Filmer, executive director of Provincial Emergency Planning office.No impacts are expected from any tsunami wave that might reach B.C.'s outer coast, Emergency officials in British Columbia say.Recent reports from Japan and Alaska indicate that any wave that might reach coastal B.C. will be very small.Currently, there are blackouts, heavy rain and high winds throughout the area. 8,000 customers in Sechelt, Whistler, Bowen Island and Quadra Island, B.C. have no power. Winds are up to 100 kilometres an hour in some areas and rainfall amounts of 50 to 110 millimetres, Environment Canada reports.Float plane services are cancelled between Vancouver, Victoria and Nanaimo.Ferries are also cancelled on routes linking the mainland to Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands.Six hundred Tube passengers had to be moved to safety in west London tonight after a landslide close to a station on the London Underground. Commuters on board an eastbound Piccadilly Line train at Boston Manor Station were evacuated after around four tonnes of debris landed on the tracks. The train collided with the rubble, but London Underground said the train stayed on the tracks. There are no reports of any injuries.  Due to inspections of damage caused, the Piccadilly Line has been suspended between Northfields and Heathrow. London Underground said all of the train's passengers were led off onto the platform at Boston Manor within 15 minutes. A spokeswoman said: "London Underground is currently assessing the impact of an embankment landslip between Boston Manor and Northfields. Initial indications are that three to four tonnes of debris has ended up on the track. An eastbound Piccadilly Line train came into contact with the debris at Boston Manor station." A replacement bus service is operating between Northfields and Heathrow. Tube tickets can also be used on Heathrow Connect rail services from Ealing Broadway. Staff at London Underground are trying to clear the debris overnight in the hope of resuming service on the line on Friday morning.Investigation of the crash into sea of a Tunisian airplane ATR-72 near Sicily on August 6, 2005 has arrived at an astonishing conclusion.  The wrong type of fuel gauge was installed in the aircraft. The gauge was designed for another type of aircraft, the much smaller ATR-42.The level indicated by the gauge was wrong, causing the pilot to think that the plane needed less fuel that it did.  Then, when fueling at the airport, less fuel than was needed was loaded in the airport of Bari. While in flight the airplane ran out of fuel, although the gauge still showed fuel available.After this conclusion by the Italian National Security Flight Agency (ANSV) the Italian National Agency for Civil Aviation (ENAC) has suspended Tunisian airline Tuninter's authorization to operate commercial flights in Italy.  A warning was also send to European Authority about what has happened asking that all fuel gauges installed on ATR-42 amd ATR-72 be checked.Wake turbulence from a larger aircraft is believed to be the cause of a crash of a Mexican government Learjet 45 into rush-hour traffic in Mexico City earlier this month. All nine on board, including Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino, and five on the ground were killed.As well as Mourino, anti-drug advisor Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos died in the wreck, leading to speculation of murder. There have been rumours the jet may have been sabotaged or bombed, but both of these have been ruled out, as have mechanical failure.To try to prevent conspiracy theories, there has been unusual openness to the press over the accident. The investigation is being led by Mexico, who have been joined by teams from Britain and the United States.Instead, the readout from the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) coupled with the knowledge that the aircraft had come in too close behind another suggest the likely cause to be an encounter with wake turbulence - dangerously unstable air left behind by an aircraft as it passes through an area. The Learjet came within 4.15 nautical miles of a Boeing 767-300 on the same approach towards Mexico City International Airport, whereas for safety there should have been around 5 nautical miles of separation between the two.It has also been revealed that air traffic control instructed the accident aircraft's flight crew to slow down to keep back from the airliner, but that this had not happened. The pilots may have lacked adequate training, as they are reported to have experienced difficulties and unfamiliarity with the plane's controls. The CVR transcript reveals that the pilots were aware they had hit severe turbulence immediately prior to the crash."Wow, check out this turbulence!" pilot Martin Oliva exclaimed to co-pilot Alvaro Sanchez. Apparently panic-stricken, he then asks "Alvaro, what should we do, Alvaro?" and is told "Give it [control of the aircraft] to me, give it to me, give it to me!" Sanchez then says simply "God." It was to be his last word. The plane became uncontrollable and crashed down at a forty-two degree angle, killing all on board.The investigation continues.47 people were injured on Friday after a Boeing 747-400, operated by Northwest Airlines, encountered severe turbulence on the Manila-Tokyo leg of a flight bound for Los Angeles. The aircraft was carrying 408 passengers and 14 crew members.The aeroplane was circling off the coast of Chiba, east of Japan's capital of Tokyo, waiting to land, when turbulence forced it to make a rapid descent.Many of the passengers who were not wearing their seat belts were thrown out of their seats. Most sustained injuries to their heads and necks by colliding with overhead lockers. None of the injuries were life-threatening, although six of the injured are expected to be hospitalised for up to three weeks.The aircraft landed safely at Tokyo's Narita International Airport, whereupon ambulances took the injured to nearby hospitals."I was so scared, I thought I would die," said an unnamed passenger, describing the incident. "My whole body was lifted into the air.""The person in front of me flew up to the ceiling. The person behind me collapsed and looked unconscious," another said."Air turbulence is believed to be the cause. The turbulence occurred 25 to 30 minutes before landing, when the seat belt light was on," said a spokesman for Northwest Airlines, Masashi Takahashi. "During the flight, we received a message from the pilot saying two or three people were injured. But [the pilot] probably assessed that an emergency landing was not necessary," he said to Agence France-Presse.Northwest Airlines has stated that the seat belt sign was turned on during the incident.Saturday afternoon, a commercial aircraft skidded off the runway at Trabzon Airport in Turkey. The airplane, which carried over 160  passengers and crew, had just landed when it left the runway and went down a cliff, where it stopped, perilously close to the Black Sea. The aircraft is a Boeing 737-800 operated by Pegasus Airlines.Provincial governor Yucel Yavuz told the press, everyone was evacuated and no injuries were reported. He announced the airport would be closed until Sunday morning as investigators take a look at the incident. It is unclear why the plane veered off the runway. Photos show the nose of the craft mere meters from the sea on the steep cliff.Passenger Yuksel Gordu told Anadolu Agency: "It's a miracle we escaped. We could have burned, exploded, flown into the sea." Fellow passenger Fatma Gordu said: "We tilted to the side. The front was down while the plane's rear was up. There was panic, people shouting, screaming."On one of the very crowded streets of Istanbul, Turkey, an elderly homeless man died of burns thought to have been caused by a fire he lit to warm himself. The police officers who came to help could not extinguish the fire with the small bottles of water which they had.The man was seen earlier in one of the most crowded streets of Istanbul screaming "I do not have a blanket, someone stole my blanket!". He was offered a cookie and a coat by two passers-by before someone called an ambulance. He was refused admittance to two different hospitals because he lacked identification, and the ambulance eventually left him where he was picked up.Croatia's sea and transport ministry said the UND Adriyatik, a Turkish freight ship caught fire in the Adriatic Sea 13 nautical miles west of the town of Rovinj on the early morning hours of February 6, 2008. An SOS was launched at 4.04 local time. It said that the 193-metre long ship was sailing from Istanbul in Turkey to Trieste in Italy and was carrying 200 trucks and nine tons of dangerous material, in addition to between 100 and 200 tons of ship fuel, causing fears of environmental damage. An official said Croatian fire-fighting planes and ships were trying to extinguish the blaze. As the fire started inside the ship, there was no way of extinguishing it from the outside. The ship's 22 crew members and nine passengers were rescued by the Greek ship Ikarus Palace that was sailing nearby and were on their way to Venice.There were fears of an explosion if the fire was to reach the fuel tanks. Also, the water currents were pushing the ship towards the Croatian coast. However, reports said the fire was diminishing by the end of the day.File:Istinye09.jpgA four-year-old Istanbul toddler was saved from serious injury by a quick-thinking shopkeeper, who caught the boy as he fell the thirteen feet (four meters) from the floor above. CCTV security cameras caught images of both the child riding on the outside of the escalator and Ali Apari's sure-handed catch.Noticing that the child was dangling from the handrail Apari ran below the boy as the four-year old neared the railing at the top of the shopping centre escalator. As the boy fell, Apari positioned himself to catch the toddler as he fell off eight feet above him.Arapi said later, "Children believe the escalators are playgrounds, the families are irresponsible. The families should take better care of their children." Arapi had just had a brain operation a month before this incident, and Arapi could have been badly injured himself, if the child had hit his head instead of his arms.However this is not the first incident of a child falling from riding an escalator at the shopping mall. Four days earlier in imitation of older children, a two-year old had to be rushed to hospital after falling from halfway up the escalator. After these falls the shopping mall has attempted to thwart attempts to ride the outside of the escalators by impeding access with flower pots. In 2006 a sixteen-year old and a three-year old died falling from escalators in Turkey.Pakistani officials have said that a suicide bomber struck a crowded market today in northwest Pakistan, killing an anti-Taliban mayor. At least eleven other people were killed in the blast, and dozens were wounded.Initially, Mayor Abdul Malik was reported to have survived the attack in the Matni area on the outskirts of the city of Peshawar. The market was crowded with shoppers ahead of the Muslim festival of Eid.Officials said that Malik, a former Taliban supporter, had switched sides and raised a militia to fight the Taliban. He had survived several attempts on his life since shifting his allegiance."Malik had survived several attacks on his life in the recent past, since he turned against the militants," said the top Peshawar official, Sahibzada Anis. "But today the militants have finally killed him."At least twelve children have been injured after a swing ride at the Puyallup, Washington Spring Fair toppled over. The ride is called a 'LollySwing', which is located in Kiddyland, where the riders sit in swings while the machine spins them around. It is owned by Funtastic Traveling Shows which has been a ride provider for the fair for over 50 years. The accident happened at around 6:30 p.m. (PDT). Injuries are being described as mostly cuts and bruises, but one child was reported to have been in a neck brace and was taken to a local hospital.  Five other children were also hospitalized.According to one witness, "it just all of a sudden topped over."  The cause is under investigation. The ride has been at the fair for the past five years. Among the seven largest operators of fair rides in Washington, from 2001 to 2007 there were only seven reports of injuries related to mechanical failures.A bomb explosion in Dera Ismail Khan in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan killed at least twelve people today, officials said. Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Iqbal Khan was said to be the target. The bomb, which was planted on a bicycle, killed Khan along with the driver and guard of his convoy.No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. The DSP's car had been badly damaged. Officials stated the bomb was detonated when Khan had been leaving his house situated in the Kutchi Painda Khan region of the town and entering his car. "It was a remote control bomb and was planted in a bicycle," Riaz Khan, a police spokesperson for the province, told the Agence France-Presse news agency.The local DHQ Hospital is treating the injured.  "We have received 12 dead bodies and 10 injured," Nasir Malik Akhtar, who heads the casualty department at Dera Ismail Khan hospital, told the media. "The dead included three policemen, including one officer, and nine civilians," he noted. Hospital authorities added that there were women and children among the dead. A state of emergency has been declared by the hospital.Two suicide bombers in Ramadi, Iraq have killed 20 people, and injured several others.According to police, the attack targeted the governor of the Anbar province of western Iraq. Iraqi police said that the attack commenced when a suicide car bomb detonated a car bomb near provincial governor Qassim Mohammed al-Fahdawi's office.The second bomb exploded when the governor along with other officials arrived to inspect the spot of the first attack. This attack was carried out by a bomber on foot. The deputy police chief died in this incident, while the governor, as well as several others, were injured.Also, an Iraqi judge and his wife were wounded by gunmen late Tuesday in the city of Kirkuk, northern Iraq.Twenty elderly people were killed Sunday when a boat capsized on Lake George in upstate New York.  The Ethan Allen was filled with touring passengers from the Detroit, Michigan area, all of whom were on a pleasure cruise to see fall foliage in the Adirondack Mountains. All the passengers aboard were reported to have not worn life preservers.Investigators speculate that the Ethan Allen capsized when it steered into the wake of another tour boat, causing the former to turn sharply.  The incident occurred at 3:00 PM EDT (2000 UTC) about 150 yards offshore at Cramer Point. Amongst those who survived was the captain, Richard Paris, 74, who was reportedly the only crew member aboard the boat.The boat operator company's license has been temporarily revoked pending a urine analysis test for alcohol consumption 80 hours before the incident.  All other boat licenses owned by the company are also being held.Twenty seven people are dead and 35 injured after the bus in which they were travelling left the road and fell into a gorge in Kashmir, India.The bus fell into a deep gorge near Barmeen, 90 km from the winter capital of Kashmir, Jammu. Twenty seven people died at the scene and another 35 have been transferred to a nearby general hospital.Police are investigating the cause of the accident.Twin blasts, allegedly caused by  improvised explosive devices, rocked two upscale malls in the main financial district in Aguinaldo Street in Iligan City on Thursday. At least three people were killed and forty-seven were wounded when two improvised crude bombs exploded and damaged the Unicity Commercial Center at 1:35 p.m. and the nearby Jerry’s Shoppers Plaza 10 minutes later. The mall blasts occurred a day before President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s scheduled visit to the City, her maternal hometown. Lanao del Norte police Superintendent Dimacuta Sanggacala said he "corrected the earlier report that six people had been killed, saying that some of those whom they thought were dead were seriously hurt." "Forty-five people were injured and being treated at the Sanitarium City Hospital and Dr. Uy City Hospital," he added.The City of Iligan (Cebuano: Dakbayan sa Iligan; Filipino: Lungsod ng Iligan) is a highly urbanized city North of the province of Lanao del Norte, Philippines, and the province's former capital. It is approximately 795 kilometers southeast of Manila with a population of 308,046 people as of 2007.The provincial police said that CCTV video footages from both  malls show two men both wearing scarfs, had placed the explosives inside bags and left at the package or baggage counters of the malls. An L-300 van was also destroyed in the blasts. The local SOCO forces, the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team (bomb experts) and the  bomb-sniffing K9 unit of the 403rd Brigade were immediately dispatched to search the site for more victims. Col. Nicanor Dolojan, commander of the Army’s 403rd said that “our suspect here are the lawless MILF group because of the type of the (improvised explosive device) that were used. That IED manifest their signature, using mortar rounds. Terrorism, which is their real intention, to sow terror in the area.That is our initial findings.” Iligan City Mayor Lawrence Cruz said that his local government received several "threats to bomb establishments - department stores, churches, schools, public places, and markets." Continuous clashes began in August between government troops and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, after the High Court annulled a Memorandum of Agreement on peace. Reuters reported that "five people were wounded in two blasts on December 4 in another part of Mindanao, which army officials blamed on rogue Muslim rebels fighting a long-running insurgency in the south." "There have been at least three bomb attacks on bus terminals in the south since July as violence escalated after Manila and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the country's largest Muslim rebel group, failed to sign a territory deal in August." it added. In November, three people were also injured in the blasts of the Traveler's Inn and the Caprice Lodge in Iligan City.The Abu Sayyaf Group (lang-arجماعة أبو سياف; Jamāʿah Abū Sayyāf, ASG), also known as 'al-Harakat al-Islamiyya' is one of several militant Islamist separatist groups based in and around the southern islands of the Philippines, in Bangsamoro (Jolo, Basilan, and Mindanao) where for almost 30 years various Muslim groups have been engaged in an insurgency for a state, independent of the predominantly Catholic Philippines.The Times of India reported that "the southern Philippines region of Mindanao is the hotbed of a decades-old Muslim separatist insurgency that has, in recent years, been suspected of harbouring Islamic militants with ties to the al-Qaida network of Osama bin Laden."A midair collision has been narrowly averted between two commercial airliners over Indiana, United States. A Midwest Airlines plane carrying 24 people and a United Express aircraft carrying 31 people came within 600 vertical feet and 1.3 horizontal miles apart.The eastbound Midwest Airlines jet was accidentally directed to descend into the direct path of the westbound United Express flight. The mistake was made after an air traffic controller erroneously removed the latter aircraft's identification aircraft tag in preparation to handing off the aircraft to the air traffic control centre for a neighbouring sector of airspace.The Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) installed in the cockpits of both aircraft sounded emergency warnings advising the pilots to take evasive action. The Midwest Airlines plane promptly pulled up out of danger. Had TCAS not activated, it is believed the jets would have struck each other. "If they didn't suddenly climb, there would have been a convergence," said Midwest spokeswoman Carol Skornicka.Had the aircraft struck each other, they would have been traveling at a combined speed of about 700 m.p.h. Airspeed would normally be higher, but congestion around O'Hare International Airport had slowed things down. The incident occurred at the end of a rush period, during a change in shift at the control centre.Jeffrey Richards, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, told reporters that pilots had mentioned three times in the course of the flight how close aircraft were coming, quoting them as saying to air traffic control on one occasion "Center, you really lined us up on that last clearance."Near air misses are classified on a scale of D to A by the Federal Aviation Authority, A being the most serious. The incident was classed as a B, the third incident of such severity in just six weeks caused by mistakes at Chicago Centre. The minimum permitted distance for aircraft traveling at an altitude of 25,000 feet, as these two were, is five horizontal miles and 1,000 vertical feet.Richards said that on the night of the incident controllers at Chicago Centre had been working close to the two hour working limit between rest breaks. "These controllers are fatigued from working such long stints and very few breaks compared to just three years ago," said Richards, who added that this was particularly true of the 26-year-old veteran who made the mistake. "Each of his sessions were right up to the two-hour limit," Richards said, adding that he was nearing the end of his shift and had returned from a break just minutes before the near-collision.Richards said that at the time the building contained a staff of 11 controllers, five trainees and one supervisor, which is one supervisor and one controller lower than usual. He went on to say that before a retirement wave, 17 controllers monitored the airspace. He says this is a part of a larger issue whereby retirements are exhausting the supply of skilled operators, in what he describes as "a systemic problem,".This latest incident raises important safety issues at Chicago Centre, which is currently undergoing a dispute between the controllers union and management over how many controllers are adequate to run the centre. The site is soon to have to handle large quantities of traffic as an annual holiday season starts. However, the FAA says that it currently has no issues with staffing at the facility, although Richards contends that low levels of staff and increasing workloads have long been a worrying factor at the facility.Skornicka said of the incident that it was "part of a bigger debate taking place," and that she felt "this is just one situation that highlights the need for modernization and overhaul of the air traffic control system."A bridge under construction along the Chambal river collapsed in Kota India, trapped more than 40 people under debris, and injured five, on Thursday.Twelve bodies have been recovered from the river, and Rajeev Dasot, the inspector general of police, said that the remaining 30 are most likely dead. Numerous rescuers were on the site, however it could take another three days to finish cleaning the area.

The bombings occurred about 38 kilometres west of Kandahar said Colonel Mike Cessford, deputy commander of Task Force Afghanistan in a late-night briefing.Another three were injured but according to reports they are in stable condition. A Canadian Forces tanker truck was damaged. All the soldiers are from CFB Petawawa in Petawawa, Ontario. A bomb also exploded at around noon but no one sustained injuries.The two road-side bombings took place in the same general area, about a kilometre apart. In the first incident a soldier was injured, while the second road-side bomb, approximately two hours later, killed the two soldiers. The names of the dead soldiers are being withheld until the families are notified. Colonel Cessford provided the details to reporters in Kandahar Thursday morning. "There was a significant separation between the two incidents," said Cessford. "These were two separate vehicles from two separate areas that were in roughly the same area."Six Canadian soldiers that were killed in southern Afghanistan last Sunday were returned to CFB Trenton in Trenton, Ontario today.53 Canadian soldiers have been killed in the war-torn country since 2002.Two bombs have exploded in Algiers, the capital of Algeria, killing at least 67 people. Both explosions were car bombs, at least one of which is being called a suicide bombing.The first explosion took place in the Ben Aknoun district in the center of the city, which is near the constitutional court. The second was near the United Nations offices in the Hydra neighborhood. A UN worker said to the BBC that the building has partially collapsed and people may be trapped inside.Jean Fabre, of the United Nations Development Programme, said that 10 staff members had been killed by the bomb which was outside the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees's offices.Several of the victims in the Ben Aknoun attack were students who were in a passing bus.Officials believe that the attacks were carried out by The al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb, which was previously known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat and sometimes still referred to as such.Algiers suffered a similar attack on April 11 of this year when two suicide car bombers claimed the lives of 33 people. According to Reuters, some people in Algeria have begun to speculate that the attacks on the 11th of the month is an homage to the September 11 against the United States.Anis Rahmani, security expert and editor of a local paper, told Reuters that "al Qaeda wanted to send a strong message that it is still capable despite the lost of several top leaders. Now the key problem is that social conditions are still offering chances for terrorists to hire new rebels."United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attacks while in Indonesia for the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference: "This is just unacceptable. I would like to condemn it in the strongest terms. It cannot be justified in any circumstances." Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, who recently visited Algeria, called the attacks "barbaric, hateful and deeply cowardly acts." "President Sarkozy has just called President Bouteflika to express the French people's solidarity and compassion towards the Algerian people," said presidential spokesperson David Martinon.White House spokesperson Gordon Johndroe said: "The United States stands with the people of Algeria, as well as the United Nations, as they deal with this senseless violence."The Algerian Prime Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem called off a cabinet meeting to allow him to visit the injured in the hospital.Two children were killed in a "suspicious" house fire in Buxton, Derbyshire, England, on Friday evening. Police arrested a 17 year old in the early hours of Saturday morning.During the fire, which occurred in the town of Buxton at approximately 2245 UTC on Friday, 23-year-old Fiona Adams and an eight-month-old baby successfully escaped through a first floor window, jumping down onto a child's trampoline. Both mother and child are currently in a hospital, having suffered from severe burns. The two children killed have been identified as five-year-old Niamh and two-year-old Cayden.Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill stated that police attended the house, following reports of nuisance and noise in the garden. Nothing was found, and the area has now been cordoned off as investigations continue. Cotterill said that incident had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and that "[s]omeone on the estate may well know any particular intelligence that we're after, or information which may assist us in this case. And I would offer for them to come forward to us in full confidence."Flowers and teddy bears have now been placed at the house where the fire occurred, with one tribute reading: "Sleep with the angels little darlings. God bless." Karen Jackson, a resident of one of the nearby houses, spoke out about the family. "They were brilliant, a lovely family," she commented. "Everyone liked them, everyone. They didn't have any enemies. It's heartbreaking, I'm still in shock now. I just feel numb."Tanya Dumstrey-Soos, 32 was killed at the Siberian Magic exotic animal park in Bridge Lake British Columbia, Canada after being attacked by a Bengal Tiger named Gangus."The animal is part of a collection of exotic and domestic animals. It appears that the animal ... reached outside of the cage and grabbed her. Upon arrival police determined that all the animals were in their cages and the woman was found lying on the ground receiving help from family," said Const. Annie Linteau, a spokeswoman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, [RCMP]. Gangus is one of two Bengal Tigers at the park.The owner of the park is Kim Carlton, the boyfriend of Dumstrey-Soos. The entire attack was witnessed by the children of Carlton, his 15 year-old daughter and 12 year-old son who both called for help shortly after the attack.Dumstrey-Soos was standing near the tiger's cage when he grabbed her legs. According to the mayor of nearby Williams Lake, Scott Nelson, all of the injuries inflicted onto Dumstrey-Soos were at her waist and below. She was taken to a hospital in the town of 100 Mile House, where she was pronounced dead.Authorities with the B.C. SPCA are not surprised that the attack happened, claiming that they tried to remove the tigers from the park several times."This is extremely sad, but not unexpected. We've spent thousands of dollars trying to have these animals removed." said B.C. SPCA spokeswoman, Marcie Moriarty who also said that the animals arrived in 2005. Moriarty also said that the tigers lived in small cages made of chain-linked fencing and that the locks were too small.The reason that the tigers were not removed from the park is because, according to Moriarty, the SPCA does not have the facilities to hold the tigers until proper housing can be provided for them."When we went up there, we realized we weren't just dealing with animal cruelty, we were dealing with a public safety issue," added Moriarty.Dumstrey-Soos worked as a receptionist and saleswoman at the 100 Mile House Advisor newspaper.Typhoon Fitow has struck Japan, leaving two people dead and a third missing. The storm moved through Tokyo yesterday.The Japan Meteorological Agency released the information on the storm's effects in the country yesterday. The deceased are a 50-year-old construction worker who died after a landslide at a dam construction site in Fukui Prefecture last night and a 76-year-old man who died after being struck by a falling tree on September 6, shortly after Fitow made landfall.

The two occupants of the vehicle were both teenagers, with one being male and the other being female. Neither have been publicly identified. They were both travelling in a black Škoda Fabia vRS at approximately 0920 BST on Sunday when they attempted to negotiate a corner and ended up colliding with a stone wall and a tree, according to witnesses. One bystander stated that the vehicle also impacted into a street light. According to a report from a person who sighted the collision: "The car destroyed a lamp-post and then demolished a 12 inch thick wall scattering huge chunks of stone and sending one big piece 20 metres down the road. The car then appears to have carried on into the garden and hit a big pine tree."After the emergency services arrived at the scene of the collision, the road was occluded, during which time members of the fire service physically removed the bodies of the teenagers from the remains of the Škoda. They were then transported to Raigmore Hospital. According to a statement from a spokesperson for the Northern Constabulary: "Following a single vehicle road traffic collision at approximately 9.18 on Sunday morning on Islandbank Road, Inverness, one young man and one young female suffered fatal injuries."Two individuals have died as the result of a light aircraft collision on the Isle of Wight in England, United Kingdom. The collision occurred at approximately 1700 BST (1800 UTC) on Saturday between Ryde and Newport, while two aircraft were participating in an organised race. Both of the aircraft were carrying two occupants. The two fatalities were both travelling in the same four-seat touring propeller aircraft. The two occupants of the second, a two-seat sports propeller aircraft, survived the crash, although one was hospitalised after the plane safely landed at Bembridge Airport.Hampshire Constabulary, who later arrived at the location of the accident, have released a statement reading: "Police are at the scene of a fatal light aircraft collision at Havenstreet on the Isle of Wight. Police received the call from a member of the public this evening at 5.08pm to report two light aircraft in collision over the island. One of these aircraft, containing two people, suffered damage and made its way safely to Bembridge airport. The other aircraft, also containing two people, came down in a remote wooded area in the Havenstreet area. Both occupants of this second aircraft have now been confirmed dead." The wing of the second aircraft was sliced off in the collision, and a farmer found it in an inverted nose-up position in woodland known as Rowlands Wood. The body of the second aircraft will be left in the woods overnight, and police closed off a nearby road while they carry out their inquiries. The two aircraft were reportedly participating in the Rolls Royce Merlin Trophy, a race organised by the Royal Aero Club Racing and Rally Association, which has been held on the island since 1981. "There was a mid-air collision just before the finish of the race," confirmed Tim Wassell, the chairman of the association. "Two planes were in collision and both had two men on board. One was a four-seater touring aircraft which, it would appear from witness reports, appears to have broken up mid-air and come down in woodland at Rowlands Woods. The second plane, a sports aircraft, was badly damaged by the collision but limped back to Bembridge Airport. The two occupants from there are safe." The race was first held in 1911, when it was founded by Jaques Schneider, the French Under-Secretary for Air, to encourage progress in civil aviation. "There were 19 planes taking part in the today's race, the Merlin Trophy, which is a precursor to the main Schneider Trophy that was due to take place tomorrow but is now due to be cancelled. Two planes were in collision and both had two men on board. A four-seater touring aircraft was thought to have lost a wing and come down in woodland. The second plane, a sports aircraft, was badly damaged but limped back to Bembridge Airport," Wassell said, telling reporters that the two survivors in the first aircraft were extremely shocked, but had no serious injuries. They were were both taken to hospital as a precaution.The victims of this incident are currently remaining unidentified. "I would also ask that anyone who has recovered parts of the aircraft, which may be spread over a wide area, take them to Newport police station", Inspector Paul Saville requested. An investigation has been launched by the Air Accident Investigation Branch and the police into the cause of crash.Two people were killed in a magnitude 5.9 earthquake in Turkey shortly before midnight local time on Thursday. The epicenter was located in Simav, Kütahya, and was at a depth of 7.6 km. In the hours following the initial earthquake, Kütahya was shaken by several aftershocks.Officials said two people were killed; one was thought to have suffered a heart attack and the other died after jumping from a window in panic. Dozens more were injured. Emergency services dispatched search and rescue crews and gave out blankets, food and water. Officials said a wastewater dam had not been damaged by the earthquake, and it posed "no risk."The earthquake was felt as far away as the Aegean province of İzmir, the northwestern provinces of Bursa and İstanbul, and even the city of Edirne, not far from the Bulgarian and Greek and borders, because the depth was very shallow. More than 18,000 people died following two earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 7.0 in northwestern Turkey in 1999.Two people have died in incidents related to storms that battered the southern coast of England last night while many across the country continue to struggle with flooding, property damage, and closure of road and railway routes.In central London, masonry from a building near Holborn tube station fell on top of a car in the street outside, killing a woman and injuring a man in the car.

The man subsequently died. Other passengers aboard the ship suffered minor injuries.The cruise line operator, Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV), said in a statement: "CMV regrets to advise that earlier today their cruise ship MS Marco Polo, en-route to her home port of Tilbury from the Azores, was hit by a freak wave during adverse sea conditions in the south western approaches of the English Channel. One elderly passenger has died and a further passenger has been airlifted for further shore-side medical assistance. The vessel sailed from Tilbury on January 5 and is carrying 735 mainly British passengers and 349 crew. Our thoughts are very much with these passengers and their families during this difficult time."In addition to the two deaths from yesterday's storms, a 77-year-old man died yesterday from injuries sustained Wednesday in the town of Caernarfon, in Gwynedd, Wales. Bob Thomas was hospitalised after being hit by a falling tree in his garden.The Met Office said that after storms this weekend, weather in the UK should return to "normal winter weather" next week. In contrast to the predictions of the Met Office, the Environment Agency have said that floods could remain in some areas of England until March, and that up to 3,000 homes in the Thames Valley could be flooded over the weekend. On Friday, they raised the number of "danger to life" level flood warnings from 17 to 24.Flooding across England and Wales has led to thousands being without electricity. In North Wales, as of Friday 17,000 people had no electricity supply, while 7,000 homes in Cornwall and Devon had their electricity supply cut off by Friday's storms.Trains operated by Southeastern, Southern, South West Trains, CrossCountry, and First Great Western have been affected. Train services to Staines-upon-Thames and Windsor have been replaced by buses.Trains on the London to Hastings service have been affected by land-slips between Wadhurst and Battle in East Sussex while trains to East Grinstead and Uckfield have been affected by a land-slip at Oxted in Surrey.Services in the south-west have been affected by damage to railway lines in Dawlish. Service is not expected to restart for at least six weeks. In Devon, buses have replaced trains between Exeter and Newton Abbot.The damage to the railway line at Dawlish has been the subject of criticism by passenger group TravelWatch SouthWest who said Network Rail — the company charged with maintaining the British railway network — had been "in complete denial" about the vulnerability of the sea wall. The group pointed to a 2004 report they produced arguing for re-routing of railway services on a disused railway in the area. "Had the recommendation in that 2004 report been heeded, the studies would already have been completed, and a clear preferred diversionary route might now be available", they said.In Wales, there have been delays on the railway between Porth and Pontypridd, and replacement bus services between Hereford and Newport due to flooding in Abergavenny. Trains going between Manchester and Cardiff have also been affected by the floods.Streets have closed in Purley, Oxford, Worcester and Wrexham. Journeys for drivers using the A29, A32, A4113, A54, and A57 roads have all been affected. A 50-foot-hole appeared in the M2 motorway in Kent which led to the closure of a ten mile section of the road.On Saturday, local authorities said a child died and three were being treated after a leisure boat capsized at Bailong Lake in Guangyuan, Sichuan province, China at 14:50 local time (0650 UTC). At about noon on Monday a search and rescue team found the body of a middle-aged male passenger; thirteen other people were still missing.According to officials, strong winds caused the accident. The boat had been running a three-hour tour and the accident happened several minutes before its finish.  Officials on Saturday said the child was taken to hospital and pronounced dead there.On Sunday, a Blue Sky rescue team spokesman said underwater video cameras located the boat at around 65 meters (around 215 feet) depth, with no signs of survivors. The search for the remaining then-fourteen people was ongoing.Five families had been on board, and the boat operator, his wife, and his son.The vessel was prepared for up to forty passengers.Divers have recovered two bodies after a passenger ship accidentally rammed a cargo vessel two miles from the port of Haifa, Israel.The Israeli cargo ship Shelly sank after being struck by Cypriot passenger vessel Salamis Glory where she was anchored two miles from the coast. None of the nearly 700 people on the Salamis Glory were harmed, but two of the Shelly 's thirteen-man crew were unable to escape the sinking vessel. Their bodies were recovered twelve hours after the accident by Israeli divers.Some of the survivors climbed on board a rescue launch lowered by the Salamis Glory, and were subsequently rescued by the navy, whilst the others were picked up by a rescue helicopter. The crew members on the Shelly were all foreign, with one of the deceased being an Ukrainian and the other being an Indonesian. They were the vessel's first mate and the ship's engineer. The survivors refused to be transported to hospital for treatment.The bodies were retrieved after a massive search in the hope that the men had survived, with six naval vessels, several aircraft and countless divers participating. The disaster triggered an oil spill that spread down the Israeli coast, prompting officials to issue a warning against bathing at the nearby Zvulun beach.The Salamis Glory returned to port in Haifa, exhibiting minor damage by to her hull. Her crew will be interviewed by police in order to determine the cause of the accident. Cyprus will also participate in the investigation and is sending a go team to the scene. Cypriot shipping official Sergios Sergiou named one line of inquiry as a possible fault with the vessel's navigation system.Two men died and 83 were arrested at the New Jersey PNC Arts center, Holmdel the scene of this year's New Jersey Ozzfest, an annual travelling hard rock and heavy metal show.

A Police Scotland spokesperson said the sighting, which was reportedly made by divers from the local area, was reported to the force at 10:40 BST (0940 UTC) yesterday.The persons have yet to be formally identified, although it is thought the bodies are of two male divers from the Netherlands, who had been diving on May 28 on the remains of the ship. The failure of the divers to re-emerge above the water and the subsequent alert by the skipper of the divers' boat prompted a large-scale search of the area, which was abandoned after two days as no sighting of the divers had been reported.A Police Scotland dive unit at Aberdeen was alerted to the scene to assist with the retrieval of the bodies from the seabed. The divers' next of kin have been told of the situation.

He also suggested that the United States could be behind the incidents: "Is there an effort against terrorism from the government of the United States, or did they send North Americans to commit terrorism in Bolivia?" Despite the accusations, the United States embassy in La Paz announced its cooperation. However, authorities have not ruled out religious motives, because Lestat is a self-proclaimed "minister of pagan rites".  Police also announced that the Chilean consulate in the Bolivian capital was also a target, to be attacked on Saturday the 25th.Names and ages of the victims of the explosions are: Marlene Patzi Tapia (26), Cristian López (26), Alva Natividad Heredia (44), and Jessica Wilson (24), the last from the United States.

North Yorkshire Police are going to interview the man and try and establish whether he was involved or not.Kyne was due to ride at Haydock on Saturday afternoon, while Wilson was due to ride at Thirsk on the same day, while riding her mother's horse, Imperial Sword — and so both were staying in the apartment as a means of accommodation, as Jamie came from Ireland and Jan was from Forfar, Scotland.  "The family are devastated and Jamie was a star," Kyne's aunt said.  "They [his parents] are so proud of him.  At the moment they are just devastated and shocked."David Barron, Wilson's trainer, paid tribute to her as "a tremendous jockey". He said: “She was just at the start of her career and was only in her first year of riding as an apprentice. She joined me at the end of last year and had ridden three winners for me out of only a handful of rides. She was very good, very capable and had tremendous potential. Everyone in the yard is just devastated.”At least two people have been killed in a landslide at the Playa de los Gigantes beach on the Spanish island of Tenerife. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has confirmed the information today.The victims were both women. One of them was identified as a 34-year-old woman from the southern part of the island. The other was identified as Marion Auril O'Hara, a 57-year-old woman from the United Kingdom. The collapsing of the cliff, which was on a small beach and stretched 130 feet (40 metres), occurred at around 1600 GMT on Sunday.Initially, it was believed that there were six people trapped underneath the cliff. 150 rescue workers dug with picks and shovels, and continued digging for over four hours. However, the search was later scaled down, with the Senior Civil Guard Officer saying that "we now believe that these two women were the only victims."Howard Williams, who was on holiday from the United Kingdom in the area, told Sky News Online that "police were aware the cliff was dangerous for days, but the only thing they put in place was a bit of builder's tape."Another mining accident occurred on Monday, in the city of Copiapó, Chile, where 33 miners had been trapped for 69 days and were rescued on October 13.Two miners, Homero Aguirre Aguirre, 40, and Daniel Lazcano, 24, were killed in the Los Reyes mine in Quebrada de Puquios, located 65 kilometers (40.4 miles) east of Copiapó, according to La Tercera. Both workers began working in the mine on the same day, and were natives of Cabildo, a town in Valparaíso Region. Mauricio Silva, aged 21, was injured in the eye, and was taken to the Regional Hospital of Copiapó.According to authorities, the accident occurred due to mishandling of explosives. It was originally reported that only one miner had been killed.Mining Minister Laurence Golborne told El Mercurio that mining companies "should be careful about the works that are being done in the mines along the country." The Los Reyes copper mine belongs to Sociedad Legal Compañía Minera Del Sur (Del Sur Mining Company, Legal Society). Golborne said that the mine was not authorized to utilize explosives by Sernageomín (National Service of Geology and Mining).Two people have been killed and 47 people have been injured as the result of a coach crash in Cornwall, England. The vehicle, which was carrying 48 passengers as well as the driver, were travelling back from a journey to the village of Mousehole to see Christmas lights. The accident occurred at 2215 GMT yesterday in the village of Townshend, not far from the town of Hayle. Road conditions at the time were icy, which may explain why the accident occurred. The first police car that arrived at the scene lost control on the icy road and crashed into the already overturned coach. The two officers in the car were uninjured, however the earlier crash had caused the deaths of two women. One of them died at the scene of the accident and the other was later killed as a result of the injuries suffered. 47 people were injured, five of them seriously.The sequence of events that is believed to have happened, according to Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, is that the coach went off the road, collided with a tree, going through a hedge before finally overturning, causing the vehicle to end up on its side. 60-year-old Ann Ellis, who comes from the village of Illogan in Cornwall, was physically involved in the crash. Desribing her experience of this incident, she said: "All I can remember is a big bang and we just went over. I got trapped under somebody else and there was someone on top of me. It was difficult to breathe but two gentlemen dragged me out. I was shaken, really shaken. I think we all were. It was horrific." Derek Smith, lives near where the accident occurred. He said that "[w]e were just going to bed when we heard a knock on the kitchen door. She was covered in mud and had no shoes or socks on and was shaking as she stood there. I could hear this commotion going on. She said to ring the police and ambulance as their coach had turned over and there were 50 people in it and some of them were injured. My wife rang 999 and the lady was in a real panic. We gave her some socks and boots straightaway because she was freezing as she had nothing on her feet."75-year-old Charles Parker, who is living in St. Agnes in the county, was also injured in the accident, suffering injuries to his leg and his head. "The roads were so icy," he explained. "I heard a cracking noise and all of a sudden we had turned over. I remember later being helped out of the coach through a window. We were close to a house and they took most of the people in there. Then helicopters turned up. It was very frightening."Inspector Matthew Shaw, who comes from Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, explained "[i]t seems from initial investigations that the coach has slipped on ice. The road is covered in a sheet of ice, it's treacherous, it's difficult to even walk down there." The amount of time taken to transport the injured passengers to a hospital was four hours.On what was the hottest start of the summer ever since measurements have been recorded in Vienna, two people were killed, several injured and a not yet estimated amount of property damaged as a strong storm hit the capital of Austria.Two have been killed and one seriously injured in a road traffic accident in Lancashire, England. The crash involved a driver in a green Rover mounting the pavement of a street in Accrington at 1500 GMT yesterday. Two pedestrians were hit by the Rover, travelling at approximately 30 miles per hour.All three involved were taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital by ambulance. There, the currently unidentified 89-year-old male driver died. The accident also seriously injured 30-year-old mother Jackie Bloomer. Her eighteen-month-old son Jayden, who was in a stroller that she was pushing at the time of the crash, died in hospital. Bloomer was later transferred to the Royal Preston Hospital, where she is currently being treated for serious injuries.Lancashire Constabulary are currently appealing for anyone who was a witness to the crash to come forward, stated that they suspect the elderly driver had a heart attack and collapsed while driving. Sergeant Pete Sculpher, from the Accrington Road Policing Unit, said, "[t]his is a tragic incident and our thoughts go out to both families involved. The collision happened on one of the busiest roads in Accrington at a time when many people would be picking children up from school so I would ask anyone that saw anything to come forward and speak to police."Two people were killed and two others were seriously injured yesterday when a boulder collapsed onto a house in the German town of Stein an der Traun, south-east of Munich. A family of four were said to have been watching television together in the lounge when a large lump of rock, about 50 tons, broke off from a 50 foot cliff above the house.The boulder fell from about 15 metres above the residence and landed on top of the house, crushing it. The cause of the rock fall is unknown, but police have said that there had been no prior signs that the cliff was unstable.The accident, which happened at approximately 1940 local time, killed a 45-year-old father and his 18-year-old daughter. A 40-year-old mother and her 16-year-old son were seriously injured and were taken to hospital for treatment, after a rescue operation that lasted into the early hours of the following morning.  The task involved up to 250 rescue personnel, some with sniffer dogs.An official from the international humanitarian movement the Red Cross said "[w]e made contact with them early on and kept talking with them through the night as we pulled away at the debris." Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian Interior Minister, spoke of his thoughts about the incident. "I have never seen anything like this," he was quoted as saying. "This is an extremely sad and terrible day."Two large earthquakes have shaken areas of Japan and Russia within 11 hours.Before dawn on Thursday, at 0:26 local time, a strong earthquake jolted eastern Japan. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that its moment magnitude was at 6.8 and that its epicenter was 30 km (20 miles) east-northeast of  Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, 485 km (300 miles) north-northeast of Tokyo, also where its tremor was observed. Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency announced that as of Friday noon, 158 were confirmed injured, no one dead or missing, and 63 houses were confirmed partly destroyed. Government officials are en route to the area to assess further damage. According to Japan Meteorological Agency, this quake arose 108 km (65 miles) under the ground in the Pacific side of Iwate Prefecture. The focus must be inside the Pacific Plate which subducts the land plate. There was no fear of tsunami, and no major aftershock was observed by Thursday noon. In Russia's Kuril Islands, which also felt the Japan's quake, there occurred another large earthquake on Thursday afternoon, at 14:43 local time. The USGS estimated its moment magnitude was at 6.4 and its epicenter was 240 km (150 miles) south-southwest of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. ITAR-TASS reported that there were no casualties or destruction or tsunami threat by Thursday evening.Two people are believed to have been killed when two light aircraft collided in mid-air, near East Midlands Airport in Leicestershire, United Kingdom.  One of the aircraft crashed while making an emergency landing at the airport after suffering damage to its landing gear.  The second has crashed near Blithfield Reservoir in Staffordshire, approximately 25 miles west of the airport.An eyewitness at the airport saw a plane crash and roll onto its side while making an emergency landing with two or three wheels missing, but all aboard that plane are believed to have survived without serious injury.  The pilot of the plane later reported that he hit something, but didn't know what, and that he saw burning debris below him.Leicestershire police say that they believe that there are fatalities at the second site.  Emergency services say there were two people on board, and that they fear that they will not have survived the accident.  Farmer Michael Sargeant, who owns the farm where the second plane crashed said that he saw that the plane was already "almost burned out" when he arrived at the scene.The airport was closed, with all flights to the airport being diverted to Birmingham, and Manchester.  The airport has subsequently re-opened.The airport have asked passengers with enquiries to contact the airport on 0871 919 9000 (from within the UK) or their tour operator.Two Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line trains have collided in Newton. Both trains consisted of two cars, one of which rear-ended the other causing major damage on both trains, multiple injuries and trapped the female operator of one of the two trains, 24 year-old Terrese Edmonds, who subsequently died. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board is underway.The crash happened yesterday around 6 p.m. EDT between the Waban and Woodland Green Line stations on the Green Line's D Branch. One train was stopped at a red signal waiting to enter to Woodland when it was struck from behind by the second train. According to MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo, "The first one was stopped at a red signal and was ready to proceed to the station when it was struck."The Green Line, which is the most heavily used light rail line in the United States, is made up of four branches. The D Branch runs along a dedicated right of way and the stations are more spaced out as opposed to the other branches which run on the street. This is one of several accidents the MBTA has experienced recently. Exactly two weeks ago, a trolley on the B Branch derailed and caught fire, and Tuesday, a fire broke out between Park Street and Downtown Crossing on the MBTA's Red Line. The MBTA's Commuter Rail division has also experienced accidents including the death of a 5-year old in Revere who was stuck by a commuter train in the middle of a grade crossing this Tuesday and a MBTA commuter train that was rear-ended by a runaway boxcar belonging to CSX back in late March. Quick thinking on behalf of the engineer on that train is believed to have averted a larger accident.Two men have been charged with starting the Zaca Fire, the second-largest wildfire in the history of California.The fire is continuing to burn through the Los Padres National Forest, and has consumed a total of 240,000 acres, having started on July 4. However, the fire is now under control, and is expected to be contained by September 4.Jose Jesus Cabrera of Santa Ynez, 38, Santiago Iniguez Cervantes of Santa Maria, 46, and the company of Rancho La Laguna, whom they worked for, have all been charged with six counts of felony in relation to starting the fire.Three of the charges are for "recklessly causing a fire that caused great bodily injury". Two counts of this stem from the crash of a helicopter that was fighting the fires, and the other from a separate incident when a third firefighter was seriously wounded while battling the flames.The other three counts are for recklessly causing a structure or forest fire, carelessness with a flaming substance and for not having the required permit to operate equipment capable of starting a fire. The fire started when equipment being used on a blocked water line sparked.58 firefighters were injured in total by the blaze, although no life-threatening injuries were sustained. Currently, 1,800 people are involved in firefighting efforts, which have cost a total of $114 million.A lawyer for the men said he felt the charges were excessive considering the circumstances. "We have a couple of hard working guys who go out to take care of a water pipe or some cattle on a very hot day on the Fourth of July and they took precautions and despite the precautions an accident happened and a fire started," said Attorney Robert Sanger.If convicted, the men could face up to nine years imprisonment. There is also the possibility of fines and action to recover the costs of the fire.Two men have been fined for their failure to prevent the 2006 Lathen maglev train accident in Germany, which caused 23 deaths and 11 injuries on September 22, 2006. The maglev train involved slammed into a maintenance vehicle at high speed on a test track after what was described as a "chain of human error" Maglevs float above the rails, kept up and propelled by magnetism. This particular Transrapid sat 1 cm above the rails and featured a rail-hugging design that reduced the risk of derailments.The state court in Osnabrück fined then track manager Guenter Steinmetz 24,000 euro and his successor Joerg Metzner 20,000 euro. Both men were convicted of 23 counts of manslaughter and 11 counts of causing negligent injury. Prosecutors had sought jail sentences but the men were spared this as the court ruled they had not acted with criminal intent. The men intend to appeal.The men had failed to install automatic brakes that would have stopped the train while there was a maintenance vehicle on the tracks and of not adhering to the "two-people-on-duty" guideline.The third defendant, traffic superintendent Guenther Mueller, was unable to face trial due to suicide fears. His prosecution will occur at a later date. He is said to be the most important person facing charges, as he cleared the train to proceed when, in fact, the line was blocked.At least two storm sewer workers in St. Paul, Minnesota went missing when a severe thunderstorm hit the city on Thursday causing a 150 foot deep storm sewer to flood. At least seven other workers made it out of the sewer."Nine went down and seven came out," said the fire chief of St. Paul, Mark Mueller.The workers were part of Lametti and Sons, a private agency employed to repair the city's storm drains. At approximately 3:00 p.m. (central time), they were ordered to evacuate the drains. The flooding began as the last of the men were climbing to the surface, but when the seventh man turned around, the other two were gone.A search was conducted, but nothing was found and another search will take place on Friday when authorities will begin to search areas of the Mississippi River.The names of the men are not known.Two new schools have opened in the North Ossetian town of Beslan to replace School Number One that was destroyed in the Beslan school siege.The mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, attended the opening ceremony and symbolically handed over the keys to the buildings to the school directors. He said the construction of the schools is part of a general plan to help rebuild Beslan and hoped that "children go to school with a feeling that will help them in life in the future".The construction was financed by the Russian government. The two schools, totalling 36,000 square meters, will house 600 pupils each. The first day of school in the new buildings will be on September 5th, 2005.Beslan's School Number One was seized by terrorists in September 2004. The 3-day standoff claimed the lifes of 344 people, 172 of them children.Two children living in a bach (a small holiday home) in Motueka, New Zealand died in a fire on Saturday night. The two children who perished in the 10.25 p.m. fire were an 11-year-old girl, Charna Maria Baileys Edwards and a 12-year-old boy, Whetumarama James Edwards.The New Zealand Police say that the cause of the fire was ashes taken from a log fire and then placed in a plastic bucket. The ashes then reignited.Also injured in the fire was the children's grandmother, 54-year-old, legal guardian to the two children, and an uncle, 34. A firefighter also received minor injuries. They are all being treated in Nelson Hospital and are in a stable condition.Grief counsellors have been sent to Lower Moutere School where the two children went to school. Eric Davies, principal of Lower Moutere School, told National Radio "The families of the classes that the children were in have been contacted and asked if they could discuss it with their kids."Kevin Whitlow, a witness to the fire, told The Press "It was horrendous knowing there were two children stuck in there and there was nothing you could do because it was already too late. The woman just kept saying, `Save my grandchildren, my grandchildren are in there'."Four people are dead after two news helicopters crashed in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States. The helicopters were covering a high-speed chase within the city, when, at the same time as the suspect left his car in order to carjack another car, the two choppers inadvertently crashed into each other. Wikinews has learned that the two helicopters belong to independent TV station KTVK (Channel 3), and ABC affiliate KNXV (Channel 15).There is still no word on an exact cause of the collision, however, the FAA is reviewing tapes to see if the helicopter pilots were communicating with air traffic controllers at the time.On a tape of radio transmissions from the Channel 15 helicopter, pilot Craig Smith (of KNXV-TV) can be heard asking, "Where's 3? Like how far? Oh jeez", followed by "3, I'm right over you. 15's right over you."  Moments later, the sound of the crash was heard over the air on Channel 15's signal, which then went to static.On July 7 and again on July 23, there were accidental leaks at the Tricastin Nuclear Power Center in France, which  is a collection of sites in four different communes: Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux and Pierrelatte in Drôme, and Bollène and Lapalud in Vaucluse.Along with two other minor incidents on July 18, it has prompted the Commission for Independent Research and Information on Radioactivity (Criirad) to order a review of security and safety. Already last week, Environment Minister Jean-Louis Borloo said the ground water near all reactors should be tested and the state of waste storage sites assessed.In the latest incident, a hundred workers were exposed to radiation. They all work for Électricité de France (EDF), which runs the Tricastin facilities with Areva. This marks the largest number of workers to be collectively contaminated in French nuclear history.The leak was at reactor number four, which was shut for refuelling. Workers were exposed to Cobalt 58 dust which escaped while maintenance work was being carried out. Sensors noticed a rise in the level of radiation and the workers were then evacuated."Seventy of them show low traces of radioelements, below one fortieth of the authorized limit," EDF said. A spokesperson later raised the number to 97 people. Criirad warned, however, that the limit was "not the level from which risk begins but the maximum acceptable level.""We have an alarm system which is meant to protect the staff from contamination via the atmosphere,” said Tricastin director Alain Peckre. "If a problem is detected, the alarms go off, our security procedures swing into place and everyone is evacuated from the building."A union representative from Confédération générale du travail (CGT) alleged that EDF was reducing maintenance and increasingly using sub-contractors, putting workers at risk in exchange for profitability."We spend 1.5 billion euros a year on ensuring our plants are in optimum condition," countered an EDF spokesperson. "Safety is our top priority over and above providing electricity to the network. Since our power stations were set up, 80 per cent of maintenance operations on reactors that have been temporarily turned off are carried out by external contractors. They are the most competent to maintain and repair specific parts of the reactor, some of which they have taken part in building."The previous incident, on July 8, involved a 74kg spill of liquid containing unenriched uranium. Thirty cubic metres of water overflowed while a tank was being emptied. Subsequent test showed that contamination may have occurred for years.Local wine growers Coteaux du Tricastin AOC have already become concerned about the negative association with "Tricastin" and have begun considering changing the name of their Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC)."It's only a question of image as nuclear and food don't mix very well in consumers' minds," said the AOC's president, Henri Bour, to The Daily Telegraph. Nuclear authorities "didn't understand our move, doubtless not wanting to admit that the nuclear industry's image is perhaps not perfect," he added."Nuclear was progress and we wanted that. We thought people were competent. Now we ask, were there previous incidents we weren't told about?" said local resident Roger Eymard to The Guardian.Autorité de sûreté nucléaire (ASN), a nuclear safety authority, has already criticised Areva for its handling of the first incident. ASN complained of poor communication with authorities and unsatisfactory security measures and operational procedures.The leaks have occurred just as President Nicolas Sarkozy has been promoting the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) as a solution to rising energy costs and global warming.France has the second largest nuclear power network in the world and generates over 80% of its electricity through nuclear power.The Nuclear ballistic missile submarines Triomphant, from France, and HMS Vanguard, of the British Royal Navy, collided deep under the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in the middle of the night between February 3 and 4, despite both vessels being equipped with sonar. The collision caused damage to both vessels but it did not release any radioactive material, a Ministry of Defence (MOD) official confirmed Monday.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said nuclear security had not been breached. "It is MOD policy not to comment on submarine operational matters, but we can confirm that the U.K.’s deterrent capability was unaffected at all times and there has been no compromise to nuclear safety. Triomphant had struck 'a submerged object (probably a container)' during a return from a patrol, damaging the sonar dome on the front of the submarine," he said.A French navy spokesman said that "the collision did not result in injuries among the crew and did not jeopardise nuclear security at any moment." Lack of communication between France and other members of NATO over the location of their SLBM deterrents is believed to be another reason for the crash. According to Daily Mail, the vessels collided 1,000ft underwater in the Bay of Biscay (Golfe de Gascogne; Golfo de Vizcaya  and Mar Cantábrico), a gulf of the North Atlantic Ocean. It lies along the western coast of France from Brest south to the Spanish border, and the northern coast of Spain west to Punta de Estaca de Bares, and is named for the Spanish province of Biscay, with average depth of 5,723 feet (1,744 m) and maximum depth is 9,151 feet (2,789 m).Each submarine is laden with missiles powerful enough for 1,248 Hiroshima bombings, The Independent said.It is unlikely either vessel was operating its active sonar at the time of the collision, because the submarines are designed to "hide" while on patrol and the use of active sonar would immediately reveal the boat's location. Both submarines' hulls are covered with anechoic tile to reduce detection by sonar, so the boats' navigational passive sonar would not have detected the presence of the other.Lee Willett of London's Royal United Services Institute said "the NATO allies would be very reluctant to share information on nuclear submarines. These are the strategic crown jewels of the nation. The whole purpose of a sea-based nuclear deterrent is to hide somewhere far out of sight. They are the ultimate tools of national survival in the event of war. Therefore, it's the very last thing you would share with anybody."First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathon Band GCB, ADC of the United Kingdom, the most senior serving officer in the Royal Navy, said that "...the submarines came into contact at very low speed. Both submarines remained safe. No injuries occurred. We can confirm the capability remains unaffected and there was no compromise to nuclear safety.""Both navies want quiet areas, deep areas, roughly the same distance from their home ports. So you find these station grounds have got quite a few submarines, not only French and Royal Navy but also from Russia and the United States. Navies often used the same nesting grounds," said John H. Large, an independent nuclear engineer and analyst primarily known for his work in assessing and reporting upon nuclear safety and nuclear related accidents and incidents.President of the Royal Naval Association John McAnally said that the incident was a "one in a million chance". "It would be very unusual on deterrent patrol to use active sonar because that would expose the submarine to detection. They are, of course, designed to be very difficult to detect and one of the priorities for both the captain and the deterrent patrol is to avoid detection by anything," he said.The development of stealth technology, making the submarines less visible to other vessels has properly explained that a submarine does not seem to have been able to pick out another submarine nearly the length of two football pitches and the height of a three-story building. "The modus operandi of most submarines, particularly ballistic-missile submarines, is to operate stealthily and to proceed undetected. This means operating passively, by not transmitting on sonar, and making as little noise as possible. A great deal of technical effort has gone into making submarines quiet by reduction of machinery noise. And much effort has gone into improving the capability of sonars to detect other submarines; detection was clearly made too late or not at all in this case," explained Stephen Saunders, the editor of Jane's Fighting Ships, an annual reference book  (also published online, on CD and microfiche) of information on all the world's warships arranged by nation, including information on ship's names, dimensions, armaments, silhouettes and photographs, etc.According to Bob Ayres, a former CIA and US army officer, and former associate fellow at Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, however, the submarines were not undetectable, despite their "stealth" technology. "When such submarines came across similar vessels from other navies, they sought to get as close as possible without being detected, as part of routine training. They were playing games with each other – stalking each other under the sea. They were practising being able to kill the other guy's submarine before he could launch a missile.Because of the sound of their nuclear reactors' water pumps, they were still noisier than old diesel-electric craft, which ran on batteries while submerged. The greatest danger in a collision was the hull being punctured and the vessel sinking, rather than a nuclear explosion," Ayres explained.Submarine collisions are uncommon, but not unheard of: in 1992, the USS Baton Rouge, a submarine belonging to the United States, under command of Gordon Kremer, collided with the Russian Sierra-class attack submarine K-276 that was surfacing in the Barents Sea.In 2001, the US submarine USS Greeneville surfaced and collided with Japanese fishing training ship Ehime Maru (えひめ丸), off the coast of Hawaii. The Navy determined the commanding officer of Greeneville to be in "dereliction of duty."The tenth HMS Vanguard (S28) of the British Royal Navy is the lead boat of her class of Trident ballistic missile-capable submarines and is based at HMNB Clyde, Faslane. The 150m long, V-class submarine under the Trident programme, has a crew of 135, weighs nearly 16,000 tonnes and is armed with 16 Trident 2 D5 ballistic missiles carrying three warheads each.It is now believed to have been towed Monday to its naval base Faslane in the Firth of Clyde, with dents and scrapes to its hull. Faslane lies on the eastern shore of Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, to the north of the Firth of Clyde and 25 miles west of the city of Glasgow. Vanguard is one of the deadliest vessels on the planet. It was built at Barrow-in-Furness by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd (now BAE Systems Submarine Solutions), was launched on 4 March, 1992, and commissioned on 14 August, 1993. The submarine's first captain was Captain David Russell. In February 2002, Vanguard began a two-year refit at HMNB Devonport. The refit was completed in June 2004 and in October 2005 Vanguard completed her return to service trials (Demonstration and Shakedown Operations) with the firing of an unarmed Trident missile."The Vanguard has two periscopes, a CK51 search model and a CH91 attack model, both of which have a TV camera and thermal imager as well as conventional optics," said John E. Pike, director and a national security analyst for http://www.globalsecurity.org/, an easily accessible pundit, and active in opposing the SDI, and ITAR, and consulting on  NEO's.File:Triomphant img 0394.jpg"But the periscopes are useless at that depth. It's pitch black after a couple of hundred feet. In the movies like 'Hunt for Red October,' you can see the subs in the water, but in reality it's blindman's bluff down there. The crash could have been a coincidence — some people win the lottery — but it's much more possible that one vessel was chasing the other, trying to figure out what it was," Pike explained.Captain of HMS Vanguard, Commander Richard Lindsey said his men would not be there if they couldn't go through with it. “I'm sure that if somebody was on board who did not want to be here, they would have followed a process of leaving the submarine service or finding something else to do in the Navy,” he noted. The Triomphant is a strategic nuclear submarine, lead ship of her class (SNLE-NG). It was laid down on June 9, 1989, launched on March 26, 1994 and commissioned on March 21, 1997 with homeport at Île Longue. Equipped with 16 M45 ballistic missiles with six warheads each, it has 130 crew on board. It was completing a 70-day tour of duty at the time of the underwater crash. Its fibreglass sonar dome was damaged requiring three or four months in Drydock repair. "It has returned to its base on L'Ile Longue in Brittany on Saturday under its own power, escorted as usual by a frigate," the ministry said.A Ballistic missile submarine is a submarine equipped to launch ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Ballistic missile submarines are larger than any other type of submarine, in order to accommodate SLBMs such as the Russian R-29 or the American Trident.The Triomphant class of strategic missile submarines of the French Navy are currently being introduced into service to provide the sea based component (the Force Océanique Stratégique) of the French nuclear deterrent or Force de frappe, with the M45 SLBM. They are replacing the Redoutable-class boats. In French, they are called Sous-Marin Nucléaire Lanceur d'Engins de Nouvelle Génération ("SNLE-NG, literally "Device-launching nuclear submarine of the new generation"). They are roughly one thousand times quieter than the Redoutable-class vessels, and ten times more sensitive in detecting other submarines [1]. They are designed to carry the M51 nuclear missile, which should enter active service around 2010.Repairs for both heavily scraped and dented, missile-laden vessels were "conservatively" estimated to cost as much as €55m, with intricate missile guidance systems and navigation controls having to be replaced, and would be met by the French and British taxpayer, the Irish Independent reported.Many observers are shocked by the deep sea disaster, as well as the amount of time it took for the news to reach the public. ”Two US and five Soviet submarine accidents in the past prove that the reactor protection system makes an explosion avoidable. But if the collision had been more powerful the submarines could have sunk very quickly and the fate of the 250 crew members would have been very serious indeed,” said Andrey Frolov, from Moscow's Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.“I think this accident will force countries that possess nuclear submarines to sit down at the negotiating table and devise safety precautions that might avert such accidents in the future… But because submarines must be concealed and invisible, safety and navigation laws are hard to define,” Frolov said, noting further that there are no safety standards for submarines.The unthinkable disaster – in the Atlantic's 41 million square miles – has raised concern among nuclear activists. "This is a nuclear nightmare of the highest order. The collision of two submarines, both with nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons onboard, could have released vast amounts of radiation and scattered scores of nuclear warheads across the seabed," said Kate Hudson, chair of Britain's Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. "This is the most severe incident involving a nuclear submarine since the Russian submarine RFS Kursk K-141 explosion and sinking in 2000 and the first time since the Cold War that two nuclear-armed subs are known to have collided. Gordon Brown should seize this opportunity to end continuous patrols," Hudson added. Despite a rescue attempt by British and Norwegian teams, all 118 sailors and officers aboard Kursk died."This reminds us that we could have a new catastrophe with a nuclear submarine at any moment. It is a risk that exists during missions but also in port. These are mobile nuclear reactors," said Stephane Lhomme, a spokesman for the French anti-nuclear group Sortir du Nucleaire.Nicholas Barton "Nick" Harvey, British Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for North Devon has called for an immediate internal probe. "While the British nuclear fleet has a good safety record, if there were ever to be a bang it would be a mighty big one. Now that this incident is public knowledge, the people of Britain, France and the rest of the world need to be reassured this can never happen again and that lessons are being learned," he said.SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson MP for Moray has demanded for a government statement. "The Ministry of Defence needs to explain how it is possible for a submarine carrying weapons of mass destruction to collide with another submarine carrying weapons of mass destruction in the middle of the world's second-largest ocean," he said.Michael Thomas Hancock, CBE, a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Portsmouth South and a City councillor for Fratton ward, and who sits on the Commons defence committee, has called on the Ministry of Defence Secretary of State John Hutton to make a statement when parliament sits next week."While I appreciate there are sensitive issues involved here, it is important that this is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It's fairly unbelievable that this has happened in the first place but we now need to know that lessons have been learnt. We need to know for everyone's sakes that everything possible is now done to ensure that there is not a repeat of the incident. There are serious issues as to how some of the most sophisticated naval vessels in the seas today can collide in this way," Mr. Hancock said.Tory defence spokesman Liam Fox, a British Conservative politician, currently Shadow Defence Secretary and Member of Parliament for Woodspring, said: “For two submarines to collide while apparently unaware of each other’s presence is extremely worrying.”Meanwhile, Hervé Morin, the French Minister of Defence, has denied allegations the nuclear submarines, which are hard to detect, had been shadowing each other deliberately when they collided, saying their mission was to sit at the bottom of the sea and act as a nuclear deterrent."There's no story to this -- the British aren't hunting French submarines, and the French submarines don't hunt British submarines. We face an extremely simple technological problem, which is that these submarines are not detectable. They make less noise than a shrimp. Between France and Britain, there are things we can do together....one of the solutions would be to think about the patrol zones," Morin noted, and further denying any attempt at a cover-up.France's Atlantic coast is known as a submarine graveyard because of the number of German U-boats and underwater craft sunk there during the Second World War.Earlier today in Massachusetts, two explosions went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon that left two people confirmed dead according to local police.  A third explosion went off at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library located 8 miles (12.8 kilometres) from the race finish.  No deaths were reported at the site of the library explosion.The explosions went off at approximately 2:30pm Boston local time.   A third explosion at the Boston Marathon site went off at approximately 4:00pm Boston local time, with the Boston police aware of the bomb before it went off.  The Associated Press is reporting that two other devices were found and the police were working to defuse them.Police and paramedics are still on scene of the bombing. Area universities were being evacuated as a precaution.A British couple have died after their car collided with a bus carrying a group of children. The crash took part on the A64 at Staxton near Scarborough, North Yorkshire on Sunday morning. The bus continued on through a hedge line and hit an unoccupied camper van. Six passengers on the bus were treated for minor injuries.Detective Inspector Geoff Carey of the North Yorkshire Police said that "The coach was carrying a group of young people as well as adults and they are very shocked. They have slight injuries but a great deal of shock." He also commented on the after crash saying that "Had the Winnebago not been there the bus could have gone into the house."The bus was traveling from Pelsall to Primrose Valley holiday park in North Yorkshire to attend marching band competition when the accident happened.The North Yorkshire police were unable to give any more details. The A64 was closed in both directions at Staxton at the junction with the B1249. Motorists were advised to avoid the area, which has become congested, according to police.Two people have been killed and tens more wounded after the powerful Typhoon Melor struck the Japanese island of Honshu on Thursday. Melor is the first tropical cyclone to strike Japan in two years.The typhoon, with winds of up to 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph) made landfall early on Tuesday. Some train services and airplane flights had to be cancelled due to inclement weather.Electricity was cut off to 40,000 or so homes and 11,000 people were evacuated to emergency shelters, the national Fire and Disaster Management Agency reported. Both confirmed casualties from the storm were hit by debris by trees uprooted by heavy winds.Melor weakened somewhat as it continued northward up Japan's central island. It is expected to move off the country's eastern coast by nightfall on Thursday.A light aircraft crashed in the remote village of Tangley near Andover in the county of Hampshire in England on Sunday, killing two people on board. The plane crashed at roughly 1300 BST in a field in Tangley and subsequently caught fire. An air ambulance, a rapid response doctor, police officers and fire officers were scrambled to the scene shortly after the crash. Officials from the Air Accident Investigation Branch were also urgently called to the area. Initially, the emergency services were prevented from approaching the aircraft due the torrent of flames that was tearing through it. A probe to investigate the crash is now going to be carried out.A spokesperson for Hampshire Constabulary stated: "A call was received at 12.40pm today after the plane was seen to come down. Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service are on scene working to put out the blaze and members of the South Central Ambulance Service are also at the sight. Two people who were on board have been confirmed deceased, although it is not yet known how many people were on the aircraft. We haven't been able to get anywhere near to find out how many people are dead because of the fire. We have to be sure that the fuel has been isolated and it is safe." The spokesperson also stated that any other passengers that were on the plane were most likely to be dead.Neither the itinerary or the take-off point of the aircraft are currently known. It is also unknown exactly how many passengers were on the plane, although the police have stated that it may be a four-seater or a six-seater aircraft. A person speaking on behalf of the members of the South Central Ambulance Service said: "We were called at 12.36 this afternoon to Tangley to reports of a patient who had been injured following a light aircraft crash. However, we believe one patient passed away at the scene."Two people have been killed in a fire in Greater Manchester, England. The couple were thought to be in their 50s. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service were called to a house fire in Farnworth, Bolton on Friday at around 1715 BST. The woman's death occurred at the scene of the blaze. The man was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital, but later died from his injuries. A witness had said that the man did not want to be helped from his burning home and that he had said to the fire brigade: "I'm sick of it all."Greater Manchester Police have said that the pair had injuries "inconsistent with fire-related deaths." The man's injuries included multiple stab wounds to the stomach and chest. The woman suffered from a slash wound in her stomach. A police spokesperson has stated, "The deaths are being treated as suspicious at this stage and a team of detectives are currently working to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident."Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Shenton said about the case, "A more detailed examination to establish the cause of the injuries will take place over the weekend. We are also continuing to seek the extended families of those who we believe to be the occupants of the house." A joint investigation between the police and the fire service has now been launched. The police are treating the incident as "suspicious," but have yet to arrest or name any suspects. The police are appealing for information from any member of the public who witnessed the incident or know any information about it.Two pieces of suspected plane debris found washed ashore  islands in the Maldives have been taken back to Malaysia for further analysis, Malaysia announced on Sunday. The pieces were found last Friday. Investigators are trying to determine if they're connected to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370)."The first thing we have to do is to determine if it is actually of plane material", said Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia's transport minister, during a press conference on Sunday. "The objects have been brought back and the investigation team will determine soon if they are debris of the MH370 plane [...] Our team here will confirm if they belong to a plane and if a confirmation is made, the pieces will be sent to the international investigation team to determine if they are from MH370," he added.The surface of one of the pieces is flat while the other is constructed of "honeycomb material." During the press conference, Liow described one the pieces as being "very small, about the size of your hand".The debris was reportedly found while authorities were searching Maldives islands for other possible debris. Pieces of debris that resemble a honeycomb material were found on a beach owned by the Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru resort, located in the Maldives island chain Kaafu Atoll. Those pieces are reported to have washed ashore onto the resort island around May 31. The investigation into the Maldives debris began as a result of photos of it being uploaded to the social networking website Facebook. The photos show at least two pieces of debris, both appear to be flat, but at least one is made of a honeycomb material. Initially the debris was disposed of as trash and was reportedly sent to the garbage island Thilafushi, where trash is sorted, exported for recycling, or burned. Reports say at the time the debris was collected, no one suspected it could be from MH370.Investigators examined several other pieces of debris that washed ashore onto other Maldives locations, the Baa Atoll and the islands of Fehendhoo and Fulhahdhoo, and found none of it was related to an aircraft. "My team has witnessed the debris and most of them are negative. They are not related to MH370 and not even plane material," said Liow on Friday. Around August 10, Abdulla Rasheed, a captain of a cargo boat which recently capsized in the waters off the Maldives, stated of debris then recently discovered, "From the pictures of the debris found on most of the islands, I can almost certainly say that they are from the cargo we were carrying." In late July, a piece of a wing known as a flaperon was found washed ashore on Réunion Island. The Malaysian government stated it's from MH370, but according to Chinese officials, the piece has yet to be confirmed to be from the aircraft.MH370, while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, China, vanished without a trace on March 8, 2014. All 239 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. On the day the plane went missing, residents on the small Maldive island of Kudahuvadhoo claimed to have seen a very "low flying jumbo jet" crash into the Indian Ocean. Some also noted the colors appeared to resemble that of a Malaysia Airlines plane. "I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly", one resident was quoted as saying to the newspaper Haveeru Daily. Some claim the plane appeared to he headed in the direction of Diego Garcia, but Malaysian authorities have discounted those claims."Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of Flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country [Maldives]. Furthermore, the data of radars at Maldives airports have also been analysed and shows no indication of the said flight," said Malaysia's transport ministry at the time of the report.A plane, carrying blood donations, crashed in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada on Thursday night. The plane, a twin engine PA-31 Piper Navajo departed from Victoria, when it nosedived into a parking lot during its final approach to Vancouver International Airport shortly after 10:00 p.m. PDT (UTC-7). Witnesses report the plane flying unusually low prior to it crashing and bursting into flames by Bridgeport Road, behind a large Ikea store."The plane engine sounded real low, it came almost straight down," according to The Vancouver Sun who asked witness Darren Van Leeuwen. "The flames shot up 100 feet or more."Both of the pilots on-board were killed, it not yet known if there were any other passengers. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner Peter German stated that it was very lucky that nobody on the ground was killed.The cause of the crash is under federal investigation.Two pilots were killed Saturday, September 1st, 2007, in an accident at the Radom Air Show in Poland. The accident occurred on the first day of the two-day show, which had begun that morning.Four Zlin Z-50s from the Zelazny air team were performing aerobatic maneuvers in front of a crowd consisting of thousands of spectators when two of them collided head on in mid-air. Both planes were traveling at 300km/h when they collided, and disintegrated on impact.The pilots, both of whom came from Zielona Góra in western Poland, were killed in the accident. One pilot, Lech Marchlewski, 62, had been intending to retire immediately after the flight, which was supposed to be his last air show performance. The other pilot was 24.An investigation has been launched into the cause of the crash. All further activities at this year's Radam Air Show are canceled, and the Radom city mayor declared three days of mourning as a result of the crash.Two planes were involved in a collision Monday night at London's Heathrow airport. Fire and rescue officials reported no injuries. The two planes, a British Airways Boeing 747, and a Sri Lankan Airlines Airbus A340 were reported to have clipped each other's wingtips while taxiing on an airport runway. The passengers on both jets are currently being taken back to the terminal while engineers inspect both aircraft.Two out of three prisoners fell unconscious while being transported in a prison van from Wellington District Court to Upper Hutt, New Zealand's Rimutaka prison, the third remained conscious for the entire duration. It was said by the third prisoner that there was a strong gas leak that was entering their van.An investigation has been launched by the New Zealand Department of Corrections in regards to where the leak originated from. The van has been removed from service until the cause has been determined.The third prisoner said: "Shortly after the van left Wellington gas started seeping into the back of the van." Once the prisoner became aware of the leak he tried to grab the attention of the staff to stop the van by banging on the walls. The van did not stop. The staff followed correct procedure during the transport.Dave East, Department of Corrections regional manager for Wellington, last night, said: "Two prisoners were found unconscious on their arrival at Rimutaka Prison... The prisoners quickly regained consciousness."All three were checked by both a prison medical team and then later hospital staff as a precaution. It has not yet been determined why the prisoners were overcome and what by. They have been returned to prison.According to Afghan officials, fourteen civilians have been killed in two bomb blasts in southern Afghanistan, as militants step up attacks ahead of next week's presidential elections.An official said the first explosion blew up a vehicle in the Gereshk district of the Helmand Province on Wednesday, killing eleven members of one family. Only one girl survived, he said.The second bomb killed three young boys, in the neighbouring Kandahar province, after a roadside bomb detonated while they were playing."All the three children are boys between six and 11 years of age," provincial police chief Mohammad Shah Khan said to the Agence France-Presse news agency.Both attacks have been blamed on the Taliban, who have pledged to disrupt the presidential elections, which are to be held on August 20.Two Santa Clara, Utah teenagers were critically injured today after being struck by lightning. Two seventeen-year-old boys were hit at about 3 p.m. when they were caught outside of the Snow Canyon High School during a sudden lightning storm. They were standing beneath a tree in view of other students at the time.School employees took the boys inside and began administering CPR straight away; an ambulance carried them to the Dixie Regional Medical Center. According to the St. Georgia police, a helicopter forwarded them to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where they have been admitted to the burns unit.The Washington County School District has identified the teens as Alex Lambsen and Christopher Dane Zdunich. According to Zdunich's mother Leslie, doctors have observed signs of both boys improving. The boys's classmates and friends turned out yesterday to support the pair. Fellow debate team member Madi Leavitt described the boys as intelligent and humorous.A United States fighter jet crash on Saturday has claimed the lives of the two American pilots onboard in eastern Afghanistan, and a NATO fighter crash at Kandahar Airfield has injured two more pilots today.The latest crash is the fifth in the space of a week. On Tuesday a helicopter was shot down, killing seven civilians. Yesterday a NATO-chartered helicopter crashed at Kandahar Airfield, killing sixteen, and another helicopter landed heavily elsewhere, injuring several people. Only Tuesday's accident involved hostile fire.Saturday's accident involved a U.S. Air Force (USAF) F-15, which crashed at 3:15 a.m. Kabul time in Nawur, Ghazni. Both of those on the two-man fighter were killed. A spokseman for Ghazni's governor stated that "The crash site was sealed off by coalition forces. Afghan police were not allowed to have access to this area."A board of officers will investigate the accident. "We mourn the loss of these two airmen and our thoughts are with their families, loved ones and their unit," said a USAF statement.Initially NATO did not identify the nationality of the pilots involved in today's accident or the nationality or model of the aircraft involved. However the MOD of the United Kingdom later confirmed that the aircraft was an RAF Tornado GR4 which crashed on take-off. The crash occurred at 7:20 a.m. local time and the wreckage burned for five hours. Both pilots ejected safely but sustained minor injuries, they are currently being treated and assessed in hospital.Reports indicate two people have been shot at Southampton Eastern Docks, England.According to initial reports, a firearms incident has occurred on or close to HMS Astute, a submarine which was berthed in the docks. The incident is thought to have occurred a short time before 1212 BST when police were called to the docks.  "Hampshire police were called by their Ministry of Defense colleagues at 12.12 pm (1112 GMT) today... and are currently liaising with them to establish the exact circumstances of the incident," said a Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson in a statement to the Reuters news agency, "[i]t is believed two people have sustained injuries as a result of gun shots being discharged on the vessel."An eyewitness at the scene told BBC News: "I saw at least six people carry a stretcher off the gangway into a waiting ambulance."  An area around the docks has been sealed off.  Although serious, Hampshire Constabulary and the Ministry of Defence have stated that the incident is not terrorist related and that there is no public safety risk. Both organisations are continuing to investigate the incident.Hampshire Constabulary later confirmed that one of the injured has died, and that one arrest has been made. It is believed that the arrested man is service personnel, and is currently being held in custody by the police.At least three people are dead after two small planes collided in a remote area of Wyoming in the United States.The collision occurred between a Cirrus SR22 and a Cessna 172 near Rock Springs just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. The Cirrus was carrying two people, both of whom died, and was traveling from Polson, Montana to Rock Springs. The Cessna had one person on board who also died, but its destination is not yet known. One deployed parachute is reported to have been seen near the wreckage, but reports state it does not appear to have been deployed by a survivor.FOX News quotes KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah as saying that debris from the collision was scattered over five acres in an area that made it difficult for emergency officials to get to. The names of the deceased have not been released, pending the notification of family members.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), at least two strong earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.7 and 6.8 rocked the west coast of Honshu, Japan killing 8 people and injuring hundreds. A two hour fire was reported at the Kashiwazaki Nuclear Power Plant number 6 reactor transformer, which is the biggest nuclear power facility in the world, causing radioactive water to leak into the sea. Officials at the plant state that the water will cause no damage to the surrounding environment.The epicenter of the first quake was located 65 km (40 miles) southwest of Niigata city, a major city on the west coast of Honshu, of 55.4 km (34.4 miles). The second quake, a 6.8, was recorded almost 12 hours later approximately 140 km (90 miles) northwest of Fukui Island, Honshu, Japan and had a depth of 350.7 km (217.9 miles)."Many people told me they want to return to their normal lives as quickly as possible. The government will make every effort to help with recovery," said Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says that no major tsunamis are expected, but small waves could impact areas locally close to the epicenter.Small, 50 centimeter tsunamis "were reported on coastal areas close to epicenter," said a statement on the USGS website which also added that in Kashiwazaki, "buildings collapsed, roads and bridges were damaged." The USGS says that damage is "moderate to heavy.""A strong earthquake has occurred, but a tsunami is not expected along the California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, or Alaska coast. No tsunami warning or watch is in effect for these areas," added the NOAA statement.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) at least two earthquakes with a magnitude 7.2 and 5.1 have rocked the island of Vanuatu.The first 7.2 quake was recorded at 4:08 a.m., Thursday morning local time (UTC+11), 55 kilometers (35 miles) east, southeast of Luganville, Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu with a depth of 144.8 km (90.0 miles). The second 5.1 quake was recorded at 47 km (29 miles) east, northeast of Santo (Luganville), Vanuatu with a depth of 149.3 km (92.8 miles) and it struck nearly one hour later at 5:07 a.m.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a tsunami bulletin for the first quake saying that "based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami not expected," but that small waves could be expected locally near the quake's epicenter.So far there are no reports of injuries, deaths or damage, but the USGS reports that damage could be "moderate to heavy.""No reports of damage or casualties have been received at this time; however, this earthquake may have caused damage due to its location and size," said a statement by the USGS on its website.Monsoonal rains in Queensland, Australia have caused massive flooding over two thirds of the state, and led Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts to declare the town of Emerald a disaster zone.The floods, which first hit the north part of the state a week ago, have since spread as far south as Charleville, where they have been compared to the floods which struck the town in 1990 and 1997, and stand in stark comparison to the drought that has plagued the area since 2003. Authorities believe that temporary floodbanks, erected near the town, will hold back the waters.More than 2,000 people have evacuated from Emerald, and more than 200 homes are on standby to evacuate. According to Acting Mayor Kerry Hayes, "[t]he shopping centres are basically short of bottled water, bread and milk obviously and a lot of baby necessities", which will be brought in by rail as the town is currently cut off by road.The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who visited Charleville, has pledged federal support during the disaster. Damage from the floods is predicted to be as high as $A1 billion.Two tornadoes touched down around the same time yesterday afternoon near the small town of Wellington, Utah in the Mill Creek Subdivision area. Initial reports are that both tornadoes rated somewhere between F0 and F1, on the lower end of the Fujita scale. Several trees were reported to have toppled over, a mobile home was severely damaged, and a travel trailer was reported to have been thrown over 50 yards. Other homes had minor damage.It is exceedingly rare for a tornado to touch down in settled areas of Utah, and even more rare for two to touch down at the same time. The last tornado to touch down in Utah was the Salt Lake City tornado in 1999.Wellington is about 130 miles (200 km) by road south-east of Salt Lake City, the capital of the US state of Utah.Two trains collided in Shandong, China 4:41am local time on Monday killing at least 71 people and injuring over 400, including four French citizens. It is still not known exactly how many people were on either of the trains.The collision occurred in Zibo when one of the trains traveling from Beijing to Qingdao jumped tracks and collided head on with a train traveling in the opposite direction from Yantai to Xuzhou. Both of the trains are reported to have been traveling at their maximum speeds when they collided."It toppled 90 degrees to one side and then all the way to the other side. When it finally went off the tracks, many people fell on me and hot water poured out of their thermos flasks," said Zhang, a passenger, to Xinhua.The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but reports say that the tracks were broken under the train traveling from Beijing. The tracks are said to have been built in 1897.Jinan Railway Bureau officials Chen Gong and  Chai Tiemin  have been fired after the accident.  The two top officials who were the former director and former Communist Party chief, respectively, will face an investigation by the Ministry of Railways. Four Frenchmen were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities named them as Pascal Boisson, 54, his son Pierre Emmanuel Boisson, 14, his daughter Joanne Boisson, 22, and his girlfriend Robin Naurence, 42. No foreigners were killed in the accident, officials said.A train, traveling at a high rate of speed, was carrying over 850 passengers when it rammed into an empty train near Rio de Janeiro. The empty train was in the process of being moved between sets of tracks.Officials are currently putting the death toll at eight, and at least 70 others are seriously hurt. There are no more survivors trapped within the wreckage. "We have to use blowtorches to open the sides of the train cars to reach the people," said Pedro Machado, commander general of the Rio de Janeiro Fire Department. "Our priority is to give support to the survivors, the passengers trapped in the wreckage, and reduce the number of fatal victims," said Col. Souza Filho, the head of Rio de Janeiro's Civil Defense Department in an interview with the Globo TV network. "They had fractures in their arms, their faces, everywhere," said Marcos de Souza, director of the Posse Hospital in a televised interview. He said the hospital does have a large emergency ward but they are bringing in extra personnel to treat collision victims.Two trains have collided at Roccasecca, 120km south of Rome in the Frosinone province of Italy.Initial reports claimed 30 injured, with people trapped in the wreckage.  A BBC report however suggested there could be at least 40 injured.  Two people have been reported missing since the collision occurred, possibly being the two drivers of the trains.  One person was reported killed.The incident is already under investigation by the Italian authorities and the Italian state Railway Operator, Trenitalia. As yet the reasons for the collison are unclear.Relief efforts are being made difficult by the dark and cold weather.The two trains were travelling on the same line, in the same direction, with different destinations. The first one (regional train number 3361) departed from the Roma Termini station, in Rome at 13:47 and was a local service to Cassino, stopping at the major stations along the route.  The scheduled time of arrival was 15:38. The second train (inter-regional 2361) also left from the Rome terminus, at 14:15, and was heading in the same direction, with a final destination of Campobasso.  The scheduled time of arrival was 17:27, and the first stop first stop was at Cassino, scheduled at 15:42.Around 15:00 the first train had stopped at the station of Roccasecca, and was just to restart its journey, when the second train came at high speed on the same rail, slamming into the back of it. The locomotive of the second train was pushed over the first train and landed on the last carriage of that train.  The injured were taken to local hospitals for treatment.A similar incident recently happened in Southern Poland.The train service has been suspended over the line. Long distance trains are reroutered on an alternative line (the one which pass through  Formia, Villa Literna e CasertaIt has been alleged that the second train passed a red signal. However no evidence about that has been collected to support this at present. An operator of the railway stated that the signal should have been red, but what he has said came from what he saw on the control panel inside the station, he did not see the colour of the signals. The two train drivers of the second train said that they did not see red signals, but only green signals. It was alleged that the train has been misrouted. Actually if the second train had to pass the station without stopping and overtaking the first train it seems resonable that it would pass on a different track. Hovewer the railway authority has confirmed that there has been no error in this sense, because both trains were scheduled on the platform 2.Several union representatives of the railways employed claim the security system on most of the Italian railways is not updated.The line was not serviced by an advanced security system to automatically help the driver. Works to implement a more modern security system were just made on the line and the new system would be ready in just some days. Nevertheless even if the line were equipped by a modern security system, it would be of no help in this case. The locomotive of the second train was a very old locomotive, a diesel locomotive of type 668, with no equipment to dialog with modern security system.The inauguration of the new "high speed" line between Rome and Naples was in program just for the day after the crash. The inauguration have been delayed.According to the United States Navy Fifth Fleet, two vessels registered to the US Navy collided on Friday in the Strait of Hormuz, located near Iran. Fifteen sailors were reported to have been slightly injured.The two craft involved in the incident were the USS New Orleans, a transporter and the USS Hartford, a nuclear-powered submarine. The New Orleans' fuel tank ruptured upon impact, leaking 90 to 95 thousand litres of diesel fuel."New Orleans suffered a ruptured fuel tank, which resulted in an oil spill of approximately 25,000 gallons of diesel fuel marine," the navy said in a statement. "Both the submarine and the ship are currently on regularly scheduled deployments to the U.S. Navy Central Command area of responsibility conducting Maritime Security Operations."A spokesman for the Fifth Fleet, Lieutenant Nathan Christensen, said that "there is no disruption to shipping traffic in the strait," and "both ships are operating under their own power and have passed through the strait.""It was a night-time event and the submarine was submerged at the time," Christensen replied when asked about how the accident happened.The Strait of Hormuz separates Oman from Iran, and is the entrance into the Gulf. An estimate by the International Energy Agency said that over 15 million barrels of crude oil passed through the strait every day in tankers. It is less than a hundred kilometres broad at its widest point.The United States military in Iraq has said that two US helicopter pilots were killed in a crash in the Salah ad Din province in north-central Iraq today.The military described the crash as a "hard landing" in a statement; however, few other details were provided.According to the statement, the cause of the incident is under investigation, although there was no immediate indication that the crash could have been caused by an enemy attack. The identities of the pilots are being withheld until their families are notified.With these deaths, as well as that of a US Marine killed today in an accident, the number of US troops killed in Iraq since the invasion in March of 2003 has increased to 4,362.A two-minute silence at noon BST (UTC+1) has been marked by millions across the United Kingdom and the European Union to remember those who died last Thursday in the London attacks.In London, all buses and cabs came to halt, and all people in their offices stood outside. Trains were not stopped but the two-minute silence was announced and marked through the underground and overground services. Aeroplanes delayed their takeoff to respect the two-minute silence.At the bombing sites, wreaths were laid in respect, with hundreds gathering at the sites to mark the silence.At Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth II stood on the forecourt in silence, accompanied by Foot Guards. Prime Minister Tony Blair marked the silence in the garden of 10 Downing Street, and Mayor of London Ken Livingstone paid his respects at Trafalgar Square. At The Open Championship taking place at St Andrews, golfers also paid their respects. Yesterday, Anfield stadium fell in silence during the Liverpool F.C. vs TNS UEFA Champios League football match.In Paris, France, President Jacques Chirac stood in silence at the Elysee Palace before taking part in the Bastille Day parade. The European Parliament marked the silence along with European Commission offices across the EU. A vigil will be held in Trafalgar Square, London at 18:00 (6 p.m.) BST (+1 UTC).Four people were killed on Saturday when two small planes collided in midair over the Florida Everglades.Broward County Sheriff's Office is reporting that the dead include Bryan Sax, 37, of Aspen, Colorado, Andrew Marc Rossignol, 21, of Stuart, Florida, Stuart Brown, 25, of Pembroke Pines, Florida, and Edson Jefferson, 30, of Miramar, Florida.The accident happened Saturday afternoon 2.7 miles southwest of Everglades Holiday Park, according to Broward Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright. Both planes took off from their respective airports at 3:30 PM Eastern Time (20:30 UTC).  Rossignol and Sax were flying in a 1979 twin-engine Piper PA-44 Seminole, from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, which was headed to a practice area near Opa-locka Airport, when they collided with Brown and Jefferson, who were flying a 1997 single-engine Cessna 172R that had departed from North Perry Airport.Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, has stated that neither pilot filed a flight plan, which was not required, because the planes were flying under visual flight rules, meaning that pilots were responsible to watch for other planes.The owners of the two planes reported them missing early Sunday after they failed to return.  Florida state officials were made aware of the accident, and the search began. A Coast Guard Dolphin search-and-rescue helicopter discovered three separate debris fields at 8:00 AM, according to Coleman-Wright. Following this discovery, the Sheriff's Office deployed air boats into the area due to accessibility issues.The bodies were recovered and identified by Monday morning, much to the relief of some relatives. Rohan Brown, cousin of Stuart Brown commented that "the whole family is thankful for that."Both Brown and Jefferson were originally from Jamaica, and Brown aspired to fly for his country's airline.Sax, taking advanced flight training, was the passenger in the Piper.Piloting the Piper was Rossignol, who grew up in Biddeford, Maine, and was following in the family profession as his father, Richard Rossignol, is a commercial airline pilot for Continental Airlines.His brother Matt Rossignol said that "he loved flying because my father's a pilot. He wanted to become a commercial airline pilot and sit next to my dad, as co-pilot."A two-story building caught fire yesterday afternoon on Boston Street in Lynn, Massachusetts. The fire engulfed the entire second floor and left nothing of the Essex County building.According to a witness, the fire started while children were cooking french fries in an apartment on the second floor. The fire took its toll on the firefighters, many were suffering from heat exhaustion. However, a tent was set up by a rehab truck, offering firefighters a chance to recover. The fire was finally put out, however, some portions of the structure did reignite with small flames. Firefighters climbed onto the roof and began tearing it open in order to find the source of the ignition. A ladder truck also sprayed down the roof.According to a witness, the roof was a tarred double roof, which may have been a factor that caused the fire to be so troublesome.The first floor consisted of storefronts for a convenience store and a video store. The second floor held apartments.Austin Hatch, 20, a survivor of two separate plane crashes, scored his first basket in college basketball on Monday night, for the University of Michigan.The shot was his second of two free throw attempts. Media photos showed University of Michigan coach John Beilen congratulating Hatch.Hatch survived a plane crash and eight-week coma in 2011, an accident that killed his father and step mother. Hatch had previously survived a separate crash in 2003, that killed his mother, brother and sister. Hatch's father was the pilot in both of those accidents. Hatch, raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, moved in 2013 to his uncle's home in California. He committed verbally to play sports with the university in 2011, and formally signed an agreement in November 2013. Of the tragedies, Hatch told reporters, "Obviously, it's a big part of my life, but I'm about moving forward and making the most of my experience here."Radioactive water has been leaking from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant following damage caused by Typhoon Etau. The plant's drainage system has been inundated by a surge of sea water brought in by the typhoon, which reached Japan on Wednesday. A spokesperson for TEPCO, the company that runs the plant, yesterday said they were investigating the leaked water but it did not present a significant danger.This comes after authorities in eastern Japan ordered over 100,000 people to leave the area as a precautionary measure as the typhoon proceeded to flood the town of Joso. Up to 25 people are still missing and at least three are dead as a consequence of the flooding. Hundreds of thousands more people in the region have been encouraged to evacuate as well. Rescue efforts are being hampered by the floods, with some people being plucked from roofs and cars by teams in helicopters.The Fukushima nuclear plant was damaged after a huge earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. As recently as April this year there were concerns about leakages as a result of electrical problems with water pumps that caused contaminated water to escape into the Pacific Ocean. A large volume of water used as part of the cooling mechanism before the reactors were damaged has since been stored in numerous steel drums.The Philippines has appealed for international assistance following the worst flooding in more than 40 years. At least 140 people have been killed and another 32 are missing as a result of the heavy rains, and the death toll from the disaster continues to rise.The Philippine government has been attempting to provide shelter, food and basic supplies for hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the floods.Typhoon Ketsana brought torrential rains to the northern Philippines on Saturday, inundating most of the capital Manila and surrounding provinces. Surging water washed away buildings and cars. Scores of people were killed and many are still missing.President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo called the disaster an "extreme event" that has strained the government's capabilities to the limit. She said rescue efforts will continue until all residents are accounted for.Two days after the flooding, rescue and relief operations continue to be hampered by the lack of rubber boats and helicopters. Many victims are demanding answers from local authorities for the lack of advance warning and the slow response to the emergency. Victims said they were stranded on their rooftops for hours before help arrived."We are concentrating on massive relief operations. [But] the system is overwhelmed, local government units are overwhelmed," said National Disaster Coordinating Council deputy administrator Anthony Golez to reporters Monday.Flood waters in some areas subsided on Monday, but thousands of homes are still reported to be without power.The government has appealed for international humanitarian assistance. Vilma Cabrera, assistant secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development of the Philippines, said Monday her agency needs donations of basic necessities."Right now we need mats, blankets, mosquito nets, cooking utensils. We need hygiene kits and we need flashlights and lighting equipment," said Cabrera."We are appealing for international humanitarian assistance," said the Secretary of National Defense of the Philippines, Gilberto Teodoro. "The potential for a more serious situation is there and we cannot wait for that to happen."The United States donated about US$100,000 to the Philippines after the disaster, as well as deploying twenty US soldiers on five rubber boats and a helicopter. China and Japan gave $140,000 and $220,000 respectively for humanitarian disaster assistance to victims. Australia provided A$1 million and Thailand is providing medical staff and supplies. The World Food Programme and the UNICEF have both donated food and other materials.People have been warned about the danger of water-borne diseases. Philippine schools have been closed until Tuesday, and many offices remained closed .Storms lash the Philippines every year. Typhoon Ketsana, although not one of the strongest, brought very large amounts of rain. In Manila Saturday, a month's worth of rain fell in just 12 hours.Typhoon Ketsana, the storm that recently wreaked havoc on the Philippines and Vietnam, reached Cambodia on Wednesday, killing at least 11 people and injuring a further 29 in the country, according to officials.The National Committee for Disaster Management said that nine of the casualties were reported in the Kampong Thom province, located 130 kilometres north of Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh.Officials had launched search and rescue teams to find more victims, and sent medical supplies, food, and other necessities to affected regions of the countries.Typhoon Ketsana had earlier flooded the Philippines, causing the deaths of 246 people and displacing almost 2.3 million whose homes were flooded. 38 people were also killed in Vietnam.Two people are dead and thousands of others lost their homes in southern China after Typhoon Chanthu. The Typhoon made landfall in the Guangdong province with winds that reached 126 kilometers per hour (78 miles per hour). The storm caused approximatively 2.2 billion yuan (US$325 million, €251 million) worth of damages.Chanthu caused downpours in China's southern provinces, with central and western provinces expected to flood as well. The Typhoon prompted President Hu Jintao to call for increased flood control measures. Chanthu is the latest in a string of recent violent storms followed by massive floods. So far this year 701 people have been killed by flooding, the highest since 1998. Along with that 347 people are missing and presumed dead. Storms have also destroyed 27,160 houses and 101,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of farmland.Typhoon Koppu, known additionally as Lando, made landfall in the northern Philippines on Sunday, killing at least two and displacing at least 16,000 people. The deadly storm caused a concrete wall in a home in Subic, Zambales to topple over, killing a 62-year-old woman and injuring her husband. A 14-year-old teenager was killed after being fatally pinned down in Manila by a tree which got knocked over. The same fallen tree injured four others, including a three-year-old. The tree additionally damaged three nearby houses. The injured people were sent to the East Avenue Medical Centre for treatment.The typhoon made landfall in the town of Casiguran, a town with a population of 25,000 in the province of Aurora. Subsequently it ripped roofs off of houses, uprooted trees, and knocked down power lines. Nine provinces were left without electricity. Flash floods and landslides heavily damaged roads, and as a result 25 roads were made impassable. The army attempted to clear routes leading to Casiguran, according to the state-owned Philippines News Agency. Nigel Lontoc, an employee of the Office of Civil Defense said that some residents were trapped on rooftops in the province of Nueva Ecija. Troops were sent to that location as a part of a rescue operation.The typhoon weakened as it moved over land, and weather improved in some regions. Officials urged residents to be cautious since Koppu may still cause landslides and flash floods. Alexander Pama, Executive Director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, said that they were asking their countrymen "not to become complacent." The typhoon is expected to move slowly over the Philippines, causing large amounts of rainfall.This year, Koppu is the twelfth typhoon to hit the Philippines, where around 20 typhoons make landfall per year. Bob Henson, weather blogger from Weather Underground, said that the Philippines is considered to be "the most vulnerable large nation on earth for tropical cyclones."After devastating the Philippines, Typhoon Megi is heading towards Mainland China and is expected to make landfall on Saturday. The typhoon regained its Super Typhoon status and is expected to make landfall east of Hong Kong and currently has winds of 185 kph (115 mph) with wind gusts up to 235 kph (145 mph).Hong Kong hoisted the lowest typhoon alert level and winds in the area are expected to gradually strengthen in the coming days. The China oceanic administration has advised that wave heights of 5–7 meters (16–23 feet) are possible. The ministry of civil affairs and the state disaster relief commission have issued a national disaster warning. Officials in the resort island of Hainan have suspended train services in and out of the island and brought 2500 fishing boats back to the harbor. Billboards in Sanya are being removed so that there is a lesser threat of danger to pedestrians. In the eastern South China sea oil platforms were evacuated and Asia's largest oil refiner, Sinopec Corp, has suspended some oil shipments to Hong Kong.Typhoon Megi passed by Taiwan devastating the island, killing seven and trapping 400 in automobiles. Megi is currently heading northwards and is expected to make landfall in Mainland China by 0600 UTC today. Megi currently has winds of 150 kph (95 mph) with gusts of 185 kph (115 mph).According to Taiwan's Central News Agency at least 23 people were missing including nineteen passengers of a tour bus. Rescuers were searching for the missing persons, while distributing aid to stranded tourists in the mountainous northwestern region of the country.China's Xinhua news agency reported that helicopter were able to evacuate 70 people from the country, it was reported that the driver and a passenger from a second tour bus were also listed as missing. According to a spokesman from Taiwan's National Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission, Cai Min, soldiers were deployed to rescue 200 stranded Chinese tourists, more than 24 tourists had been rescued as of Friday. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center has advised that Megi could make landfall in South China as early as 0600 UTC today. Although Megi is expected to make landfall quite a distance from Hong Kong, local officials are reminding residents to remain alert. The government has deployed teams to Hong Kong to mount sandbags, clear drains and trim trees, temporary shelters have also been opened.Domestic and international flights in Southern China have been cancelled as strong gales are moving in ahead of Megi. About 130,000 fishing boats in the Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan provinces have been called back to port and about 150,000 in Fujian have fled to safety. The highest warning level has been issued for coastal ares China in anticipation of Megi. The warning gives officials the power to evacuate areas six hours before impact, close schools, airports and recall vessels in danger back to port. Full Wikinews coverage of the 2010 hurricane seasonThe Philippines is bracing for yet another storm as Typhoon Mirinae heads towards the area. The country is still reeling from catastrophic flooding as a result of a number of other cyclones, including Ketsana and Parma. So far, over 1,100 have been killed during the Philippines' typhoon season. A Category 2 storm, Mirinae is packing 1-minute sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h), or 90 mph (150 km/h) 10-minute, and is forecast to strike the eastern portion of Luzon before moving westward, potentially over the city of Manila. Torrential rainfall, in addition to destructive winds, are expected to impact the region starting late Friday. As a result, numerous landslides are likely. "Considering our land is already saturated with water, it may cause flooding in some areas. It is hard to tell if there will be floods but we are preparing for the worst," said a civil defence office spokesman. Residents have been advised to take precautionary measures. Evacuations have also been declared in some areas, and ferries have been canceled.  The storm might re-intensify once it moves over open waters of the South China Sea.Typhoon Parma was threatening to strike the Philippines capital of Manila, devastated from Typhoon Ketsana just one week earlier, but has taken a more northerly path, largely sparing the city."It’s a big help, we weren’t ready for another catastrophe," said Marides Fernando, mayor of the Marikina municipality. "Prayers worked; everyone was praying. We can go back to our homes."Forecasters say the storm changed course before striking the Cagayan province in the northern part of the country. Most of the region is expected to avoid major disaster. However, Parma, still packing sustained 10-minute winds of 110 miles per hour, has knocked down trees and powerlines, and is forecast to drop heavy precipitation. The most significant impacts may come in the form of mudslides.Tuguegarao Mayor Randolph Ting said, "Many houses have been destroyed and trees and electricity poles uprooted. The province hasn’t been hit this hard in 10 years. It will probably take 10 to 15 days for power to be restored". In advance of the storm, President Gloria Arroyo issued a "state of calamity" and tens of thousands residents were advised to leave their homes. Trevor Taylor, a resort owner in Santa Ana, Cagayan, reported that "The town is locking down; you don’t want to be on the road at this time. We have moved everything that is loose, boarded every window and put extra material on the roof so it doesn’t get blown off. A lot of people here have homes made of flimsy material, and these are likely to suffer a lot of damage."All interests in the areas potentially in the path of Typhoon Parma are urged to monitor its progress over the next few days.The Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan issued a typhoon warning on Sunday, as Typhoon Parma entered the Bashish Channel between the Philippines and Taiwan.According to the bureau, the storm's winds reached 119 kilometres per hour (kph) and had gusts of up to 155 kph, and was expected to bring torrential rains. As of 06.00 UTC, Parma was centered 310 kilometres south of Taiwan's southernmost point, Oluanpi.The storm's speed had slowed upon reaching the Bashish Channel, the bureau added, from 7 kph to 5 kph.1800 people have been evacuated, some of them forcibly, from remote rural mountainous areas, after the weather bureau made its warning.An official with the bureau told the Agence France-Presse news agency that "the typhoon is forecast to move along the (northern) track until Monday night and then turn southwest. In the next two to three days, the typhoon may move slowly and hover around the Bashi Channel, and after that, how it moves needs further observation."Earlier this week, Typhoon Parma had passed over the Philippines, killing fifteen people and flooding northern parts of the country.Chinese officials ordered the evacuations of one million residents, following the arrival of Typhoon Morakot on the coastline south of Shanghai on Sunday. The move comes a day after the typhoon pounded the neighbouring island of Taiwan with torrential rains that caused the heaviest flooding in the country for half a century. According to the Taiwanese Central Weather Bureau, the storm's winds reached 110 kilometres per hour.As of the night of August 9, the eye of Morakot was about seventy kilometres away from the Chinese province of Fujian. The typhoon is estimated to be moving toward China at eleven kph.480,000 people in Fujian were evacuated, and a further 490,000 were forced to leave their homes from the Zhejiang province. 48,000 boats were called back to their harbours by officials. The Chinese official news agency Xinhua reports that the city of Wenzhou|Wenzhou cancelled 39 departing flights.Super Typhoon Saomai made landfall in the eastern province Zhejiang in China around 5:30 p.m. Thursday afternoon. By Friday evening Saomai had left a path of destruction in Zhejiang and neighboring province Fujian. Over 100 people have been reported dead with even more missing. An estimated 3.5 million people were affected by the storm, some 1.6 million of whom were evacuated.Reports from the civil affairs bureau tell of large-scale material destruction. In Zhejiang, 18,000 houses were destroyed and in Fujian, 32,000. Hundreds of thousands of buildings have been damaged. Phone and power lines were knocked down and outages were wide-spread.With wind speeds of 216 km/h (135 mph) at the time of landfall it is the strongest typhoon to hit China since August 1, 1956, when a storm with wind speeds of 244 km/h killed 4,900 people.Emergency plans have been implemented and supplies are being sent in from other provinces. The central government has allocated 166 million yuan to assist the affected region.The Pentagon made a public statement on Tuesday saying that four ICBM detonation fuses were accidentally delivered to Taiwan by the United States military back in 2006.According to the Pentagon's official statement, the Taiwanese government had purchased helicopter batteries from the U.S, but instead received four nose cone fuses by accident in the autumn of 2006. The U.S. government was notified of the mistake by Taiwanese officials earlier in 2008, and the full extent of the mistake was finally realized last week.On Tuesday, the fuses were returned to the United States, and an investigation was launched to determine the cause of the accidental shipment. A U.S. government official cited an error in labeling as a possible cause of the incident.Taiwan has disputed parts of the Pentagon's claim. While the Pentagon stated that Taiwan only alerted the U.S. of the error recently, a spokesperson for the Taiwanese military argued that the United States military was notified by Taiwanese officials immediately after the delivery of the fuses. The U.S. responded by saying it was informed of the mistake, but was not told that Taiwan received the nose cone fuses and was therefore not aware of the full extent of the situation.China has issued a statement in response to the incident, criticizing the U.S. for its negligence and demanding for the cessation of arms sales to Taiwan.The accidentally-delivered nose cone fuses are designed to be employed in the LGM-30 Minuteman, an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.An investigation by the United States Coast Guard has concluded the largest oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry was partly the result of a "poor safety culture" aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. The April 2010 explosion aboard the rig, which is located in the Gulf of Mexico, triggered a disaster that led to widespread environmental damage.The report squarely blames Transocean, which managed the Deepwater Horizon, for being largely responsible for the explosion that claimed eleven lives. The rig had "serious safety management system failures and a poor safety culture," the report says. Transocean fiercely rejected allegations that crews aboard the rig were badly trained and equipment was poorly maintained.A slapdash safety environment on Deepwater Horizon would mean equipment was not mended or replaced if it meant losing valuable hours of drilling, the Coast Guard found. Electrical equipment believed to have caused a spark that ignited flammable gas was described as being in "bad condition" and "seriously corroded." The report found that other deficiencies—improperly assembled gas detectors and emergency equipment; audible alarms switched off because of nuisance false warnings; complacency with fire drills; and poor preparation for dealing with a well blowout—all contributed to the disaster.Transocean attacked the report's conclusions and suggested the Coast Guard may have played a role in the disaster. A spokesperson for the company said Deepwater Horizon had been inspected by Coast Guard officials only months before the explosion, officials who said it complied with safety standards. "We strongly disagree with—and documentary evidence in the Coast Guard's possession refutes—key findings in this report," the company said.This week, Deepwater Horizon owner BP launched legal action against Transocean. It also filed a lawsuit against Halliburton, the company that cemented the well, and Cameron, which manufactured the rig's failed blowout preventer. BP is reportedly seeking to claim US$40 billion in damages, and alleges it has taken a massive financial hit and loss of reputation. In a statement, BP said it filed the lawsuits "to ensure that all parties ... are appropriately held accountable for their roles in contributing to the Deepwater Horizon accident".In the lawsuit against Transocean, BP claims the company missed signs that a disaster was imminent and that it "materially breached its contractual duties in its actions and inactions leading to the loss of well control, the explosion and the loss of life and injuries onboard the Deepwater Horizon, as well as the resulting oil spill." Halliburton, BP alleges, was riddled with "improper conduct, errors and omissions, including fraud and concealment" which led to the disaster, and continues to refuse to cooperate with investigators. Transocean dismissed the lawsuit as "desperate" and "unconscionable," and announced a countersuit against BP, which it claims was responsible for the disaster "through a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk, in some cases severely." Halliburton and Cameron, which is also countersuing, announced they would defend themselves against BP's allegations.U.S. President Barack Obama marked the anniversary of the explosion by conceding that although "progress" has been made to ensure the safety of deep water drilling rigs, "the job isn't done." Obama's comments came less than a week after leading experts raised serious questions over the security of deep water drilling as the U.S. government approves more exploration without improving safety measures. Charles Perrow, a professor at Yale University, said the oil industry "is ill prepared at the least" to deal with another oil spill, despite repeated assurances from the industry and the government, which insists lessons have been learned from the Deepwater Horizon disaster. "I have seen no evidence that they have marshaled containment efforts that are sufficient to deal with another major spill," he said. "Even if everybody tries very hard, there is going to be an accident caused by cost-cutting and pressure on workers. These are moneymaking machines and they make money by pushing things to the limit."However, politicians have insisted they are doing all they can to help clean the coast of oil. "Cleanup efforts in some places are still ongoing, and the full scale of the damage done to our state has yet to be calculated, but the good news is that most all of our fishing waters are back open again," said Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal at a press conference. "All of us here today want the entire nation to get the message that Louisiana is making another historic comeback."Gulf Coast residents, activists and relatives of the crewmen who were killed in the explosion paused this week for the anniversary of the oil spill's beginning. A helicopter took the victims' families from New Orleans to over the site where the rig stood, where it circled. "It was just a little emotional, seeing where they were," said one victim's mother. Remembrance services and candlelight vigils were held in the Gulf Coast region, which continues to suffer from the fallout of the catastrophe. The families have expressed anger at BP, who they say is being unfair and slow in paying out compensation from a $20 billion fund. The area is still heavily affected by the disaster and reconstruction of the seafood industry that once thrived is slow. While tourists are beginning to return to the region, many are angry at BP and the Obama administration over how they handled the disaster. All the fishing waters in the area have now opened again, but people who live in the area remain dissatisfied. "I don't see any daylight at the end of this tunnel," one fisherwoman said. "I don't see any hope at all. We thought we'd see hope after a year, but there's nothing."Regular commuter Dan Ruefly detonated a half-mile (800 m) section of the old Woodrow Wilson Bridge just after 12:30 a.m. local time (0530 UTC) on Tuesday 29 August 2006. The detonation brought down over 2,600 tons of steel. The bridge, which carried the Capital Beltway across the Potomac River, was scheduled for destruction as part of a $2.4 billion project to replace the span. The bridge has caused traffic delays nearly every day since its opening in 1961. Mr. Ruefly had won the honour of pushing the plunger in a contest to find the worst commuting experience; after a motoring accident he became stuck in a traffic jam. Mr. Ruefly (who leaves home at 5:00 a.m. every day to beat the traffic) had crashed into a stationary tractor-trailer on the bridge, leaving him with severely crushed hips. The ambulance sent to transport him to hospital was unable to make it through rush hour traffic and, as a result, Mr. Ruefly almost died.The detonation of the six-lane drawbridge was originally planned to occur at 11:59 p.m. however it was delayed by over half an hour when spectators broke through security fences to get a better view, the bridge was finally brought down at around 12:35 a.m. There was a 20 second delay between the time of initiation and the actual detonation. It was reported that the plunger was not actually wired to the charges, and was only a ceremonial prop to signal the actual detonation by the engineering crews.The demolition is part of a complete replacement of the former six-lane bridge with a twelve lane version comprised of two side-by-side drawbridges. Work started on the project as early as 1999 and the new north-bound bridge was opened on June 10 2006. This demolition is the first step in the next stage of the project; to replace the existing bridge with the southbound 'twin'.Boat traffic on the Potomac River and vehicle traffic on the new Wilson Bridge were halted during the detonation. Airspace was also briefly closed for a short duration.A U.S. F-15 fighter aircraft crashed into the ocean early Tuesday approximately 45 miles off the coast of Ikeijima island, part of the Okinawa chain. The aircraft was stationed at the Kadena air base.The pilot, whose name was not released, ejected safely and was rescued.The cause of the crash is under investigation.On behalf of the FDA, U.S. Federal marshals have begun seizing beds which have killed at least seven patients out of about 30 who had become trapped by the products. Three versions of the bed were found to be "dangerous to health" by the FDA, with the specific danger of, "placing patients at an increased risk of entrapment and asphyxiation."The model numbers of the faulty beds include the Vail 500, 1000, and 2000 Enclosed Bed Systems. The beds are made by Toledo, Ohio-based Vail Products, Inc.In a government press release, the FDA pointed out that Vail had failed to heed two previous warnings issued by the agency, asking the company to comply with regulations regarding proper labeling and usage directions. The FDA also said that Vail had failed to supply required documentation to the agency to comply with the Medical Device Reporting and Reports of Corrections and Removals regulations.At the time this story was filed, the Vail web site made no mention of today's FDA announcement. Toledo's WTOL News 11 reported that, "Company officials say their beds aren't dangerous if used properly." The Vail corporate web site claims that the beds allow, "the patient to move about freely within a safe, padded environment" and "control wandering."The FDA is the U.S. agency responsible for regulating food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics.A United States F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jet has crashed in Libya the U.S. military said. The U.S. Air Force jet, flying in support of the no-fly zone over Libya as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn, crashed somewhere outside of Benghazi last night around 10:30pm CET (9:30pm UTC), according to the Daily Telegraph. Telegraph reporter Rob Crilly found the wreckage, saying on his Twitter feed: "[J]ust found a crashed US warplane in a field. believe a mechanical failure brought it down[.]"The crew members - the pilot and his weapons officer - both ejected safely. A U.S. rescue helicopter found the pilot, while the weapons officer was found and cared for by Libyan rebels until U.S. forces retrieved him. Both crew members suffered only minor injuries, the military said. The pilots' identities will be released after the next of kin are notified.A spokesman for the U.S. Africa Command said it was believed the crash was caused by mechanical failure and was not shot down by hostile forces. However, an investigation into the cause of the incident is underway, according to the military. The aircraft, based out of RAF Lakenheath, England, flew out of Aviano Air Base in Italy.Record-high temperatures are being reported across parts of the Midwest and Southern United States. However, the extreme heat has turned deadly for many. Over 50 deaths are being blamed on the heat, with the latest deaths coming from Alabama and Missouri.In Kentucky, a fire broke out at an electricity substation, forcing the Tennessee Valley Authority to request major electrical consumers to reduce their power use. In Nashville, yesterday's high temperature reached 102ºF. Nashville has seen 13 days this month where the high temperature reached above 100ºF.The extreme heat wave is now expected to move into Ohio, a state where very heavy rainfall caused evacuations and considerable structural damage. The National Weather Service predicts heat indexes to soar as high as 104 degrees.Investigators with the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are examining a damaged section removed from a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-300 that blew out in-flight on Monday, July 13.The passenger jet was flying between Nashville, Tennessee and Baltimore, Maryland when the hole, which measured seventeen inches by eight, opened up in the jet's roof. A safe emergency landing was performed and the 126 passengers were evacuated from the aircraft without injury.The damaged section arrived in Washington, D.C. yesterday for examination by the NTSB. They have reported that there is no corrosion or obvious pre-existing mechanical damage to the segment.As a result of the incident Southwest have inspected all 180 of their Boeing 737-300s, without result, within 24 hours of the incident. Continental Airlines have done likewise to their own examples of the type.In 2008, Southwest was fined after it was found to have operated 47 jets that were overdue for inspections. In the light of Monday's incident, former NTSB member and maintenance specialist John Goglia criticized the airline's maintenance practices and governmental oversight. "Where's the maintenance programs with this airline? Where's the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)? Where's the oversight? I mean, the list goes on and on. These people on this airplane really don't know how lucky they were."Southwest released a statement the day after the mishap in defense of their maintenance. "Southwest Airlines has an exemplary safety record that always is our focus. We are actively engaged with the NTSB in finding the cause of this incident and assuring that it does not happen again. We applaud our pilots and flight attendants for their expert handling of this situation and our customers for their cooperation."The inspections Southwest failed to perform in 2008 concerned examining the top of their aircraft for structural damage after a weight reducing modification was discovered which could reduce the strength of the design. NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said that "It looks like that (Airworthiness Directive (AD))  would apply [to Monday's incident]. We are going to look at the maintenance records and the maintenance practices, and we are going to want to know if all of these (ADs) were followed."However, the FAA said that the inspections did not apply to the section that failed and, in any event, Boeing and Southwest ultimately came up with an improved design that was up to standard.A spokesperson for the United States military has tonight categorically denied reports of a U.S. helicopter opening fire on Libyan civilians during a rescue mission of two fighter pilots who crashed near the eastern city of Benghazi.Conflicting reports have emerged of the mission to rescue the two U.S. fighter pilots who ejected from their aircraft. The F-15E Strike Eagle that they were flying reportedly suffered a mechanical failure on Monday night and crashed. Soon after the accident, a U.S. military helicopter landed in the area to extract the airmen and reportedly opened fire on civilians, wounding six of them.Unconfirmed reports indicate the six civilians were taken to a hospital in the area after being fired upon by the helicopter, a V-22 Osprey. One of the wounded, a young boy, was shot in the leg, which will likely now require amputation. Another of those reported injured said the shooting caused "great panic." Wikinews understands the Pentagon is to open an investigation into the rescue mission.However, a U.S. military spokesperson denied the reports "one hundred percent", and said the incident "didn't happen". He said the aircraft which rescued the two airman was not fitted with weapons. "The Osprey is not armed and the Marines barely came off the aircraft," he said.The pilot of the fighter aircraft was extracted during the rescue mission, while the weapons officer was found and cared for by Libyan rebels before later being retrieved by American forces. Both crew members suffered only minor injuries, the military said. The fighter aircraft was deployed over Libya in support of the no-fly zone approved by the United Nations Security Council over Libya as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn.The United States Navy was forced to withdraw from its Cyclone Nargis relief efforts in Burma/Myanmar today due to the continued refusal of the ruling State Peace and Development Council government to allow the delivery of aid. Four U.S. naval ships were ordered to depart from the area on Thursday. After 15 failed attempts to convince the ruling military junta to allow U.S. helicopters to deliver much needed supplies to areas such as the Irrawaddy Delta, Admiral Timothy J. Keating, the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, indicated that they were left with no choice but to leave."I am both saddened and frustrated to know that we have been in a position to help ease the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people ... but have been unable to do so because of the unrelenting positions of the Burma military junta," Keating said via his headquarters. He said that the U.S. would still be willing to offer help if the junta simply allowed them in.The British and French navies have also been forced to withdraw due to the junta's unwillingness to allow them to provide assistance to cyclone victims. United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had been previously assured by the ruling Burmese generals that relief workers would be allowed to help, but reports indicate this has still not happened on the ground. The UN, in its latest report on the situation, noted that Burma was faced with a "serious lack of sustained humanitarian assistance for the affected populations."Foreign aid agencies already in place and trying to help victims have reported that they continue to face problems in delivering large volumes of relief supplies in the affected regions. The U.S. naval ships had 22 heavy-lift helicopters that would have been ideally suited to the task. "Important heavy-lifting capability in the delta would have been a standard operating procedure for relief agencies in the response," said Paul Risley of the United Nations World Food Program. The UN group has been trying to get ten civilian helicopters to fill the role in the interim, but the Burmese authorities have still not allowed nine of the civilian aircraft to be used in the relief efforts.To date, the Burmese military has allowed 106 airlifts of foreign supplies to occur, but only into Rangoon, the largest city in the nation. Those delivered supplies are slated to be forwarded to the areas devastated by the cyclone. However, the ruling junta has refused to allow inland flights of foreign military helicopters to deliver relief aid. The junta believes they have sufficient abilities to deliver the resources but foreign analysts believe that the group does not wish to demonstrate to the Burmese people that it needs outside help. Doctors Without Borders has said that the relief efforts to date are not enough, and that many remote areas have received no assistance.The UN determined that Burma may need relief efforts for a year. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has found that 495,000 acres of rice production areas have been damaged out of a total of 2.5 million acres. The areas are either still under too much water to sustain crops, or have been contaminated by seawater during Cyclone Nargis. According to Risley, the year-long importing of rice would be required as the damage was done just before the normal planting season. "This year's crop will not meet requirements," Risley said. "The losses to the production of rice are very deep. It would be typical for the WFP to provide food rations through the next harvest, which could be a year away."Access by foreigners to Burma has been generally restricted since the cyclone. Visas and travel permission to affected areas have been limited by the government. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement reported that "the small number of visas and the short duration of travel permits for access" into the areas in need of aid "continue to impose serious constraints on the effectiveness of overall operations." The World Health Organization has said that, as of yet, there appears to be no "second wave" of deaths in the wake of the blocked relief efforts, which may be a sign of hope.78,000 people were killed by the cyclone. To date, another 56,000 remain unaccounted for, according to Burma's government.A U.S. nuclear-powered submarine collided with a Japanese oil-tanker in the Strait of Hormuz late last night. Only minor damage to the tanker and no serious injuries were reported. The USS Newport News submarine collided with the stern of the Japanese oil-tanker, causing minor damage to the tanker. No personnel on either vessel were seriously injured, US Navy and Japanese government officials said. The straits of Hormuz connect the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and is a major waterway for oil tankers. Immediately after the incident the tanker was able to continue to nearby port in the United Arab Emirates. The tanker is owned by Japanese shipping company Kawasaki Kisen Ltd. The Japanese government was informed of the incident soon after by the Navy and the U.S Embassy in Tokyo. They have requested that the U.S investigate the cause of the incident. The recent incident is a stark reminder of the February 2001 incident when a U.S. Submarine rammed into a Japanese fishing vessel in waters off Hawaii, killing nine people.The United States is preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Sandy. The hurricane, which is expected to hit late Sunday into Monday, could affect up to sixty million people. The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that all subway, bus and train services in New York City would be suspended from 19:00 EST on Sunday evening. The hurricane has already caused damage and fatalities in several Caribbean countries this week. Meteorologists are concerned that it will turn into a "Frankenstorm" as it amalgamates with a winter storm in the run up to Halloween. It has now been downgraded to a post-tropical storm by the National Hurricane Center.  It has sustained winds of 85 mph. Authorities warned that a full moon could trigger high tides with storm surges of up to 3 metres which would cause sea water to surge through Lower Manhattan.It is also expected to cause serious flooding in several areas on the Mid-Atlantic coast, including Long Island Sound and New York Harbour.New York mayor Michael Bloomberg urged people to take action now to keep themselves safe. "I don't want anybody to go to bed tonight thinking that they can spend the day worrying about the night after," Mr Bloomberg said. "If you don't evacuate, you are not only endangering your life, you are also endangering the lives of the first responders who are going in to rescue you," he said.It is expected that the hurricane will affect flights. Air France announced that it will cancel all flights to New York and Washington today. British Airways has cancelled all flights to and from the east coast of the U.S. today.The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, has announced that several bridges are to close from 19:00 EDT — George Washington, Verrazano-Narrows, Throgs Neck, Whitestone, Henry Hudson, Cross Bay Veterans, and from 16:00 EDT the Tappan Zee. He also said the worst of the storm has not yet reached the city.The New York Stock Exchange trading floor is closed today and is to remain closed tomorrow but electronic transactions are still able to take place. Spokesman Rich Adamonis told Reuters "We continue to monitor the situation and to communicate with government officials, regulators, and markets participants,". The United Nations headquarters in New York have also been shut down. Several states have announced states of emergency- Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington DC and also a coastal county in North Carolina.Public schools are to remain closed tomorrow in New York, Washington and Philadelphia. The Washington metro is also to be closed tomorrow because of the hurricane. The state of Delaware has announced a mandatory evacuation order for 50,000 people from coastal areas and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie urged people not to take risks. "We have to be prepared for the worst here. I can be as cynical as any of you but when the storm comes, if it's as bad as they're predicting it will be, you're gonna wish you weren't as cynical as you might otherwise have been." he said.CNN have reported that about 1.5 million people are now being affected by power cuts.The hurricane has also affected the election campaigning plans of the two main presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. Romney announced that he had cancelled a planned campaign rally yesterday evening in Virginia Beach and Vice-President Joe Biden cancelled a visit there on Saturday.Evacuees from New Orleans arrived on Sunday and have continued to come to Utah, utilizing the facilities at Camp Williams, the training facility for the Utah National Guard, to house the incoming people.  Flights from New Orleans to Salt Lake City International Airport provided by JetBlue Airways under a contract from FEMA have been shuttling people from New Orleans to many destinations throughout the United States, including Utah.  In addition, Utah Air National Guard relief missions transporting food and other supplies to New Orleans relief efforts have also been returning with people in the cargo areas of the airplanes on return flights.   "In keeping with our mission to assist in the security and safety of our homeland, we stand trained, ready, and able to respond to the call to assist our fellow citizens in Louisiana, Mississippi and elsewhere," said Maj. Gen. Brian Tarbet, Utah National Guard Adjutant General.The people on board the airplanes had no idea where they were going.  In one case the airplane was headed to San Antonio and at the last minute while still airborne the destination was changed to Utah.   Peter Coroon, Salt Lake County Mayor: "Some of the people look dazed. Some of them are just happy to be out of where they were. Some of them are eager to find their loves ones they've been separated. Some of them weren't sure where they were going when they left New Orleans." Governor John Huntsman, Jr. utilized surplus state funds by declaring a state of emergency to begin efforts housing and clothing people coming to Utah, however some of this will likely be reimbursed by the Federal Government at a later date.  He announced that Utah was willing to take up to 1,000 people at shelters in Utah, and that amount was later increased to over 2,000.  On Monday, President Bush signed an executive order granting the emergency declaration in Utah to provide Federal assistance for the evacuees in Utah.After arriving in Utah, one evacuee said "I want to thank the people of Utah for their hospitality and for restoring my faith in America."  Another evacuee said "it seems like heaven, looking at the mountains and getting a breath of fresh air and saying, 'Thank God we made it.'"Not all evacuees were pleased with the move to Utah.  "I knew where Utah was, but nobody told me that's where we were going. Nothing personal. It's nice. But I don't know anybody here," said Bergeron, among the first batch of 152 evacuees to arrive at the Camp Williams Utah Army National Guard training site.The Utah chapter of the American Red Cross has been training volunteers over the Labor Day weekend, and according to one official they have been overwhelmed with community support to help the evacuees.  The line of volunteers to receive the training helping those at Camp Williams was litterally out of the door at the Red Cross offices today.  One volunteer, Kayelynn Wright said, "The last couple of days we’d talked about it and said, 'What can we do?' So when I saw it (a call for volunteers) last night, I called (my neighbor) this morning and said, 'We gotta go!'" The Red Cross has asked that you contact the local office if you plan on volunteering or donating any new clothing and other items to help the evacuees.Volunteers from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Saturday gathered at the LDS Humanitarian Center in Salt Lake to assemble more than 50,000 hygiene kits for hurricane victims.  Plastic bags were stuffed with toothbrushes and toothpaste, combs, soap, washcloths and hand towels. The supplies will be shipped to a church-owned storehouse Georgia for distribution. Transportation requests are also being honored by the Utah state government, and evacuees are having transportation to anywhere in the United States paid for at state expense.  In addition, a small amount of extra money is being donated directly to each family to help with immediate expenses.  The Utah Transit Authority has already established a regular municipal bus service between Camp William and downtown Salt Lake City, which will begin formal service starting tomorrow morning.On Monday, the United States ride-sharing company Uber announced suspension of its experimental self-driving car program after one of the cars fatally struck a 49-year-old woman pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona on Sunday night.The company characterized the suspension of the program — in the Phoenix area and also in Pittsburgh; San Francisco; and Toronto, Canada — as a standard response in the wake of the accident. Uber released a statement that "Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident." According to a spokeswoman, the company is also conducting its own investigation. It was reportedly the first time someone died in an incident involving a self-driving car.Elaine Herzberg was hit at about 10 pm local time (UTC -7) on Sunday when she walked into the street with her bicycle about 100 yards or less from a crosswalk. She died later in hospital. The Volvo car was operating autonomously. Sylvia Moir, chief of police in Tempe, told the San Francisco Chronicle that according to the human operator in the vehicle — Rafaela Vasquez, 44 — "it was like a flash", there was no time to override the computer to take evasive action, the first indication was the sound of impact. The police stated the car was three miles per hour (mph) over a speed limit of 35 mph. According to Moir, recordings from the car's video cameras indicated it would have been "difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode". Moir told the San Francisco Chronicle that while she "[wouldn't] rule out the potential to file charges" against Vasquez, "preliminarily it appears that the Uber would likely not be at fault in this accident".Uber started its Arizona self-driving test program in February 2017, using vehicles that had been banned in California due to safety concerns. The next month one was involved in a collision while in self-driving mode after another car failed to yield the right of way; the Uber SUV rolled on its side.A United States Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed Monday  (before 3:00 pm CST) after takeoff at Duncan Field at  Campus of Texas A&M University, during a routine mission flight shuttling cadets from the university to Camp Swift. Two active-duty soldiers were killed in the crash, and four Army National Guard soldiers were injured.Second Lt. Zachary Cook, 22, a native of Lufkin, Texas and a December 2008 graduate of Texas A&M University, was killed in the incident. Cook was a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps cadre at Texas A&M University and also graduated from Lufkin High School. U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards on Wednesday paid tribute to Cook on the floor of the U.S. Congress. “His loss brings a great sadness to his family and friends, the extended Texas A&M family, and the Army, all of us deprived of this patriotic citizen who was dedicated to serving our great nation in uniform,” he said. Edwards is a Democratic Party member of the United States House of Representatives from the 17th District of Texas, based about Waco.The crash also killed Sgt. Charles C. Mitts, 42, of Spring, Texas. He died about 9 p.m. Wednesday night at Memorial Hermann Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Ann Brimberry. Mitts was the oldest of five men on board the ill-fated helicopter. He was assigned to Iraq from September 2006 to September 2007 with Company C of the 1st Battalion, 108th Aviation Regiment, based in Topeka, Kansas. Mitts was posthumously promoted from his present rank, Chief Master Sgt. Gonda Moncada announced.The three others on board the UH-60 Black Hawk were injured in the accident. The pilot, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Matthew J. Smith, 41, of Leander, and 1st Lt. Ellis W. Taylor, 31, of Buda, were in stable condition Thursday at Brooke Army Medical Center. Sgt. Richard D. Ravenscraft, 24, of Austin, also was initially listed as critical but upgraded to stable in College Station.The accident is under investigation by the Combat Readiness/Safety Center in Fort Rucker, Alabama, home of the U.S. Army Aviation Center. "They have a reputation for extreme thoroughness and quickness," said Texas Guard Capt. Adam Collett. The probe team will review the wrecked helicopter and debris scattered on Duncan Field next to Duncan Dining Hall, near the Corps of Cadets field on the school's College Station campus, about 100 miles northwest of Houston, Texas. "Every piece the way it landed is still in place," said Texas Army National Guard Chief Master Sgt. Gonda Moncada, adding that investigators began the expert examination of evidence Wednesday morning.As part of a five-ship training exercise, the Blackhawk helicopter was performing a training demonstration for about 190 Corps of Cadets in the ROTC Rudder’s Rangers Annual Winter Field Training Exercises. It was also used to transfer the students to Duncan Field just off George Bush Drive. When the helicopter was attempting to take off, a rudder reportedly malfunctioned. "At first, it looked like he was hot-dogging and then very quickly it was obvious he was in trouble and not messing around. All of a sudden he dropped straight back down into the ground," Scott Walker Walker, publications manager for the A&M Association of Former Students said. "There was a bunch of people on Duncan Field and everyone went running and diving for cover," he added. The aircraft entered a rotational spin upon take off and plummeted down on its tail boom, with its cabin section largely intact.The chopper will be transferred to the Austin Aviation Support Facility, where it is was based. Some parts of the Blackhawk will also be sent to the Corpus Christi Army Depot for testing, Officials with Texas Military Forces officials said."Our thoughts and prayers go to the crew members involved in this tragedy, and especially to the family and friends of the crew member who reportedly died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash," A&M President Elsa Murano stated. The UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine, medium-lift utility helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft. It is a utility tactical transport helicopter that replaces the UH-1 "Huey" and has been in use since 1979.It was based at the Austin Army Aviation Support Facility at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. The aircraft's soldiers came from Austin and San Antonio. They were part of the 36th Combat Aviation Brigade, at Austin's Camp Mabry.The Campus of Texas A&M University, also known as 'Aggieland', is located in College Station, Texas, USA. College Station is a city in Brazos County, Texas, situated in Central Texas. It is located in the heart of the Brazos Valley. Aggieland is centrally located within of three of the 10 largest cities in the United States and 75% of the Texas and Louisiana populations. Southside of the campus contains halls both for the Corps of Cadets members and "non-regs". Facilities for the Corps of Cadets are located in the Quadrangle, or "The Quad", an area consisting of dormitories, Duncan Dining Hall, and the Corps training fields.A car crash in the British region of Leicestershire has resulted in the deaths of six people: three men and three women. The incident, involving a lorry and a Ford Mondeo, occurred at around 01:00 UTC today (02:00 local time) on the A607 road.Simon Adkin of the local police said that, "the black Mondeo was travelling towards Leicester and the lorry was travelling in the opposite direction." He announced that the police "are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and saw either of these vehicles beforehand to get in touch."The driver of the Ford, who was killed in the incident, was a 23-year-old male. An 18-year-old man, 19-year-old woman and 18-year-old woman were also killed in the incident. The ages of the other two people are not yet known.As a result of the crash, the A607 is expected to remain closed for most of today.The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom yesterday issued an update detailing progress on its response to the August 2015 crash at Shoreham Airshow that killed eleven.The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is expected to release a final report within months. It has issued a total of 21 recommendations to the CAA, which yesterday confirmed it has accepted all of them. Pilot Andy Hill, who survived but was seriously injured, faces a manslaughter investigation.The CAA says it has already implemented more than half the recommendations in addition to publishing its own review of airshow safety in April. In April, it accepted measures including an increase in the distance between spectators and aircraft at shows. The latest recommendations include changes to aircraft maintenance and the process of receiving permits.A CAA spokesperson said "We have been working on them as and when the recommendations came in and reviewing them in detail. We are continuing to work to implement the changes." They said the plan is "to have as many in place as possible before the start of the air show season." Hill was performing a large loop when his 1950s Hawker Hunter jet crashed into the A27 road near the town of Shoreham in West Sussex, England. Cars were caught up in the impact. He was an experienced pilot with a career with British Airways and the Royal Air Force followed by years of display flights. His military experience included flying Harrier jump-jets.Both Hill and the aircraft were well known amongst airshow enthusiasts. The plane was sold by the military when it was decommissioned in 1996. Fellow pilot David Wildridge, who also participated in the Shoreham show, said at the time Hill was "well-known and well-loved", "very professional", and "the best of the best."All eleven killed were men. An inquest is presently scheduled for March. It was one of three deadly European airshow crashes in four days, with fatal collisions in Switzerland and Slovakia.A driver for the UK coach firm National Express has been jailed for five years after causing a crash last year that killed three people. Philip Rooney, 49, was in a double-decker coach near London's Heathrow Airport which rolled on January 3 last year.The vehicle landed on its side after Rooney attempted to take a 40mph turnoff at 55mph on the M4/M25 slip road near Heathrow. He was described at Oxford Crown Court today as driving like one 'possessed', possibly in a bid to make up for lost time after a luggage issue had delayed the London-Aberdeen service's departure.Rooney had been delayed after summoning a taxi to transport one family's luggage due to a lack of room on the crowded coach. This delayed departure by an hour and a half.The coach, with 69 passengers on board, skidded along on its side after overturning whilst Rooney made a safety announcement over the vehicle's PA system. 76-year-old Christina Toner from Dundee and 30-year-old Chinese citizen Yi Di Lin were killed, while 78-year-old John Carruthers from Chertsey, Surrey succumbed to his injuries six months later.Another 65 people sustained injuries, including four who had amputations as a result of their injuries and 19 who suffered fractures. "After Heathrow the driver drove like he was possessed. He kept overtaking everything and going like the clappers," said one passenger. Fire and rescue crews had to cut several victims from the wreck.Rooney had been convicted on five previous occasions of speeding in public service vehicles during his career of fifteen years with large passenger vehicles. He was also disciplined in 2004 by National Express after he was caught tampering with a speed limiter to allow him to drive his coach faster.Defending, Mohammed Khamisa QC said of Rooney "The events [of the day in question] have crushed him and continue to haunt him," and that he offers his "heartfelt apologies" to all victims and relatives.Rooney pled guilty to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He was jailed for five years, banned from driving for three and ordered to take an extended driving test.Since the August 20 release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, who was convicted of planting a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103, there has been growing controversy surrounding the events which led to his release. Pan Am Flight 103 exploded in-flight in 1988 as the aircraft flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and eleven more on the ground. Al Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted of the bombing.In recent years, the British government has negotiated oil development deals with Libya. As part of the negotiations, at least three UK ministers traveled to Libya in the months leading up to Al Megrahi's release.Leaked letters from UK Justice Secretary Jack Straw to his Scottish counterpart, Kenny MacAskill, stated that it was in the "overwhelming national interests" of the UK to include Al Megrahi in prisoner transfer agreements which were part of the oil trade deals. These letters have lead to widespread speculation that the British government influenced the Scottish decision to release Al Megrahi.Al Megrahi was released on compassionate grounds as he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. However, this diagnosis was called into question as The Times revealed that the health director of the Scottish Prison Service, Dr. Andrew Fraser, relied on the advice of a general practitioner instead of an oncologist, when issuing his recommendation for release. When Al Megrahi returned to Libyan soil, Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi thanked Gordon Brown and Queen Elizabeth for his release.Saif al-Islam Muammar al-Gaddafi, the son of Muammar al-Gaddafi, has stated that during the prisoner transfer agreement (PTA) phase the trade negotiations, the Al Megrahi case was not specifically named, yet it was implied."The fight to get the [prisoner transfer] agreement lasted a long time and was very political, but I want to make clear that we didn't mention Mr Megrahi. At all times we talked about the PTA. It was obvious we were talking about him. We all knew that was what we were talking about," he said.In Scotland, the release of Al Megrahi has caused significant debate. A poll conducted for the BBC by ICM Research found that 60% of Scots thought the Scottish Government was wrong to allow the release. 68% believe the decision was made fore reasons that did not pertain to Al Megrahi's health."No one I think seriously believes we made any other decision except for the right reasons," First Minister Alex Salmond said on Wednesday. "I think it was the right decision. I also absolutely know it was for the right reasons.""We didn't think that the Lockerbie decision should be linked to trade or oil decisions by anyone who looked at the coincidence that the prisoner transfer agreement was being negotiated at the same time as commercial contracts," Salmon also stated.The UK Prime Minister's office stated Monday that, "There was no deal over [the] release of al-Megrahi nor could there ever be, since all decisions were for the Scottish, not U.K. government.""The central assertion in this story is completely untrue and deeply misleading," Downing Street added.Correspondence released on Tuesday by the UK government shows that Abdulati Alobidi, the Libyan minister to Europe warned of "catastrophic effects for the relationship between Libya and the UK," if Al Megrahi were to die in prison in Scotland.When Salmond asked Straw what the national interests of the UK were, Jack Straw replied, "Having sponsored terrorist attacks in the past, it [Libya] is now an important partner in the fight against terrorism." Libya approved a large oil exploration contract to BP within days of the letter.Libyan officials have said that since al-Megrahi's return to Libya, his health has deteriorated. He was not part of the 40th anniversary celebrations for Gaddafi's coup d'état held on Tuesday.A documentary broadcast on Sunday on the UK's Channel 4 claims the RMS Titanic was weakened by a three-week fire before its infamous 1912 sinking.More than 1,500 people died when the vessel sank partway between Southampton, England and New York, United States. The disaster has long been thought down to a collision with an iceberg.Titanic: The New Evidence focuses upon research by Irish journalist Senan Molony, who spent 30 years investigating the accident. Based on photographs of RMS Titanic at the shipyard that built it in Belfast, Ireland, he suggested fire by spotting large black streaks in the region struck by the iceberg.The documentary claims expert analysis confirmed these streaks likely signify a large fire in a fuel store. Alleging temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Celsius, Molony said metallurgists had opined "when you get that level of temperature against steel it makes it brittle, and reduces its strength by up to 75 per cent."Molony claims "This isn't a simple story of colliding with an iceberg and sinking. It's a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice and criminal negligence[....] The fire was known about, but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea." He said J Bruce Ismay, President of the firm behind construction of RMS Titanic, ordered the twelve men tasked to attempting to control the fire to avoid informing passengers. Molony also claims the ship backed into its Southampton berth in a bid to hide fire damage.A 1912 report to the UK Parliament mentioned, but dismissed as a cause, the on-board fire. Ray Boston suggested in 2008 fire may have broken out ten days prior to departure. Boston investigated the disaster for twenty years. Richard De Kerbrech, who wrote several books documenting the accident, said Molony's proposal the fire severely weakened the ship's structure is believable.Molony said "Nobody has investigated these marks before or dwelled upon them." The photographs, taken by engineers on the ship, only recently came to light when they were sold at auction.Fire  fighters  in the United Kingdom used a hand grinder to remove a metal ring from a man's penis 2 days ago. They had been summoned after doctors at the Royal Wigan Infirmary in Greater Manchester became worried that the man may have required amputation of the penis as the ring was cutting off the blood flow.The man had been taken to the infirmary's Accident and Emergency department, where attempts were made to cut through the ring. However, this failed as hospital cutting equipment was not strong enough to sever the hard metal the ring was made of.Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service responded to the call made at around 12.10 GMT Thursday, after the penis started swelling up. Two fire fighters spent twenty minutes cutting the ring off the then anaesthetised man, who is in his 40s. The mini hand grinder used for the job is more regularly used for tasks such as cutting through padlocks.A thin sheet of metal was placed around the man's penis to protect it during the operation. It is thought that the ring had originally been cut off the end of a pipe.The families of two members of the crew of a United Kingdom RAF Hawker Siddeley Nimrod which crashed almost exactly two years ago during a mission in Afghanistan are suing their government. None of the twelve crew and two other officers on board Royal Air Force Nimrod XV230 survived the midair explosion.According to a report last year by Assistant Deputy Coroner for Oxford Andrew Walker "The aircraft was in my judgment never airworthy from the first release to service in 1969." The coroner recommended grounding the entire Nimrod fleet, but this was never done, with the government saying that the aircraft were safe after modifications carried out after the crash.The final report on the accident blamed the crash on a fuel leak into a dry bay, which ignited after contacting an air pipe that was hot. The jet had undergone midair refueling just minutes previously. The plane was one of a fleet of fifteen that were intended for retirement last decade but still operate, despite having suffered various mechanical problems, including fuel leaks.A writ was today served on UK Defence Secretary Des Browne by the families of Sergeant Ben Knight, 25, and Flight Lieutenant Steven Swarbrick, 28. The writ accuses the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of failing to minimise risks, negligence and denial of the right to life. This last charge makes it the first time the MoD has faced a legal challenge under the European Convention of Human Rights.Graham Knight, Ben's father, claimed that "Nobody has been held accountable for the actual crash. The Government has stood up and said we are sorry. The coroner has said the aircraft was never airworthy but nobody in the RAF or MoD has ever been held accountable for it." He went on to say he was 'disappointed' in the RAF and that My son was proud to be in the RAF and I thought it was full of honourable men. But no one would stand up and take responsibility or resign."September 2 will mark the second anniversary of the accident, the biggest loss of UK military lives in a single incident since the war in the Falklands in 1982. It is the last chance for compensation to be sought, as this must be done within two years of the event.On Thursday, ten of those on board British Airways Flight 38 launched a case against Boeing over the accident before a court in Illinois. They are suing over an alleged flawed design that allowed an ice buildup to bring the 777 jet down at London's Heathrow Airport. Scottish advocate Peter Macdonald spoke to Wikinews, commenting on the case and explaining the surrounding legislation. He has experience of litigating aviation accidents.Although investigations are ongoing, the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has issued interim reports indicating ice buildup on an engine component.  As the jet passed over Siberia on its journey from Beijing, China it encountered significantly reduced temperatures.  The AAIB has determined that the fuel was at a temperature below 0°C for an unusually long duration.  This is believed to have caused water in the fuel — which met all relevant international standards — to have frozen into crystals. A build-up of ice developed on a component called the fuel/oil heat exchanger.  This restricted the flow of fuel to the engine, resulting in an "uncommanded engine rollback" — a loss of power — on approach for landing.  Investigators initially struggled to produce enough ice under test conditions but later discovered that at high concentration, fuel can form ice at very low temperatures in enough quantity to seriously restrict fuel flow.  This does not occur when fuel demand is lower, as the hot oil then becomes sufficient to entirely melt the ice.  It was only when extra fuel was pumped in from the tanks for the landing that the crystals became a problem.  The fuel/oil heat exchanger is a dual purpose part designed to simultaneously melt fuel ice and cool down engine oil by passing oil pipes through the fuel flow.The crew of the aircraft were praised for their handling of the emergency, avoiding the airport's perimeter fence and nearby houses to crash land short of the runway. None of the 136 passengers and 16 crew were killed but some of those suffered serious injuries, including broken bones and facial injuries. Some were left unable to fly and there were cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).The crash was triggered by highly unusual circumstances; the first AAIB report noted that cold fuel behaving in this manner was an "apparently hitherto unknown phenomenon."  As part of the investigation, data of 141,000 flights of 777s equipped with the engine model involved — the Rolls-Royce Trent 800 — was reviewed without finding any relevant circumstance similar to the accident flight, although there was later a similar incident in the United States in which the aircraft continued safely after repowering one engine; the second did not lose power.Given the circumstances surrounding the case, Wikinews asked Peter Macdonald if the plaintiffs intended to prove that Boeing knew or should have known the Rolls-Royce powerplant was dangerously defective by design. "I rather suspect that there may be product liability legislation in place in whichever US jurisdiction is being used," Macdonald explained. "Such statutes normally do not require proof of fault, nor do they require proof of knowledge. All that you have to show is that there was a defect in the product which caused the losses concerned... If I am correct that it is a product liability suit, then the fact that this is the first such accident matters not."Macdonald went on to discuss the international legislation and how it interacts to the plaintiffs and the three companies involved — Boeing, British Airways and Rolls-Royce. Only Boeing is currently named in an action over the case.  "There are several reasons why the plaintiffs will wish to sue Boeing in the States," he said.  "Were the plaintiffs to seek redress in a court in the United Kingdom, it is unlikely that the relevant part of Boeing would be subject to jurisdiction here."  He also pointed out that "US damages are generally higher than English damages.""As to whether Boeing should settle, that all depends upon the basis of the action. If it is a fault [negligence] based action, they will be able to defend it. If fault is not needed, that is why they would want the action dismissed, forcing litigation in the UK." In the UK, a product liability suit "would ordinarily be directed against the importers, i.e. British Airways... It would be a simple matter to sue BA here [the UK] for the physical injuries and their financial consequences," said Macdonald. "That leaves RR [Rolls-Royce]. I assume that the engine was made in the UK. They would be liable for a defect in terms of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, Part I." This piece of UK-wide legislation states that "where any damage is caused wholly or partly by a defect in a product [the manufacturer] shall be liable for the damage." Damage includes injuries.US courts decide international jurisdictional issues under the Jones Act, passed as a result of Bhopal litigation, "which makes it much more difficult for a foreigner to sue in the US if the accident did not happen there... My restricted understanding of that is that it is likely that it would be difficult to remove an action from a US court where the aircraft was made in the US." He further pointed out that the court would require there to be an alternative court with jurisdiction over the issue. "It may well be that the relevant part of the Boeing group is not subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts... I have seen cases where it was made a condition of the grant of an order under the Jones Act that the defendants would submit to the jurisdiction of a court in Scotland and that they would not take a plea of time bar in the even that an action was raised within three months of the court order."He then addressed the international law with regards to what could be claimed for against air carriers such as BA. In a previous case against the same airline, Abnett v British Airways, the House of Lords ruled in 1997 "that the only remedy for an injured passenger on an international flight is to sue under the Warsaw Convention, Article 17, incorporated into our law by the Carriage by Air Act, 1961." The Warsaw Convention governs liability for international commercial airlines. At the time, the House of Lords was the highest court of appeal in the UK, although it was recently replaced by the Supreme Court. The Abnett case referred to British Airways Flight 149, in which Iraq captured the aircraft and occupants when it landed in Kuwait hours after Iraq invaded in 1990. Peter Macdonald represented Abnett in this case.The Convention "provides a remedy for "bodily injury". Interestingly, the term only appeared in the final draft of the Warsaw Convention. There is no mention of the term in the minutes of the many sessions which lead up to the final draft. It was produced overnight and signed later that day." This term creates difficulties in claiming for mental problems such as the fear of flying or PTSD, although Macdonald points out that "there is a large amount of medical literature which details physical and chemical changes in the brains of people who are suffering from PTSD."In King v Bristow Helicopters, heard before the House of Lords in 2002 "held that PTSD was not a "bodily injury", but expressly left the door open for someone to try to prove that what is known as PTSD is the manifestation of physical changes in the brain which have been brought about by the trauma. Such a litigation is pending in Scotland." Macdonald is acting in this case.Actions against Boeing are not bound in this way, as the Warsaw Convention only applies to airlines, making the States an attractive place to sue due to the issues with demonstrating jurisdiction against the relevant part of the Boeing group in the UK. Another reason why the plaintiffs would prefer to sue in America is that in the UK "there would be liability [for BA], and that would be subject to a damages cap. An action in the US [against any defendant] would probably have the same cap, but is likely to award damages more generously in the event that the cap is not reached."The Ministry of Defence has made the announcement of the death of a soldier in Afghanistan. The soldier came from A Company 4 Rifles.The man, whose service was as a part of 3 Rifles Battle Group, has currently not been identified as his next of kin have requested waiting for a time period of 24 hours before releasing any more information. He was on foot patrol near the town of Sangin in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan when he was killed as the result of an explosion in the area on the afternoon of January 22. The total number of military personnel that has been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 has now increased to 250.Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield, who is the spokesperson for Task Force Helmand, said: "It is my sad duty to inform you that a British soldier from A Company 4 Rifles, serving as part of 3 Rifles Battle Group, was killed by an explosion near Sangin in Helmand Province earlier. He was on a foot patrol, part of a larger operation to provide security for the local population in Sangin, when the explosion happened. His courage and the sacrifice he has made will not be forgotten."A fell running event, the Original Mountain Marathon, has been abandoned under appalling weather conditions,which left a number of competitors stranded.The event's abandonment was confirmed (according to web reports) at midday by race director Jen Longbottom.The disruption of the event that occurred at the top of one of the highest mountains in the Borrowdale Valley(a region of the UK's Lake District) left hundreds of runners stranded due to flooding.The runners were taking part in the Original Mountain Marathon (OMM), until flooding and heavy rain forced them to stop. Around three hundred people were forced to take shelter at the nearby Honister Slate Mine."The weather is absolutely horrendous and it's a scene of chaos up here," stated Mark Weir, the owner of the slate mine. "I believe there were up to about two thousand people who entered this race and I advised the organizers not to go ahead with the event.""The mountain rescue teams are still trying to account for everyone," added Weir. "We have had people coming in throughout the day in pretty bad states. They are dripping wet through and very cold. Our staff are helping to transport them off the mountain pass and down to Cockermouth where the emergency services are taking over. But we need more help and more buses as there are still plenty of people up here."12 people have suffered from hypothermia, and one of them has been taken to the nearby Cumberland Infirmary Hospital for treatment.This afternoon the RAF launched an operation to rescue nineteen sailors from a Spanish trawler in difficulties in a North Atlantic storm.Radio contact with the FV Cibeles was lost yesterday evening at 2030 UTC when the crew reported to the ship's owners that they were in trouble. Last night, UK Coastguard picked up a satellite emergency beacon signal as winds reached speeds of over 70 mph.This morning a RAF Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft located the ship adrift 180 miles off the Scottish Western Isles. A nearby tanker, the Aegean Spirit, diverted with the intention of taking the trawler in tow and arrived at 1500 UTC. However, the tanker was unable to take the trawler on tow, and with no other vessels capable of towing the ship nearby, the Coastguard Rescue Seeking helicopter "Mike Uniform" was launched from Stornoway to extract the crew. The tanker remained on scene to offer some protection from the weather, currently reported as gale force winds and rough seas.David Cameron, the leader of the main UK opposition party, the Conservative Party,  has said that aid to Burma should be dispatched by air if the Burmese government does not improve access to the country for aid workers.David Cameron said this in a statement, which was released today. Below is part of the statement:However David Miliband, British Foreign Secretary and Labour Party member, told the BBC's Politics Show yesterday that air delivery is "not a very effective way of delivering aid" and that "humanitarian experts and aid workers who make all the difference on the ground are clear that that is very much the third, fourth, fifth or even sixth best solution."Nick Clegg, leader of Britain's second largest opposition party, the Liberal Democrats, took Cameron's side however, saying that the international community ought to support direct aid-dropping "to show that we mean business".22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis, with the majority of the casualties having taken place in Burma. Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of the country.The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.Gordon Brown, the UK Prime Minister, has asserted that the UK will provide Myanmar with aid after the recent cyclone."I believe nearly a million people are now in need of food aid and we will have to help the families of those where people have died," he said.He continued by saying that the UK will cooperate with other countries. "I want to pledge on behalf of the British Government that we will work with the whole international community to make sure that food aid is available to the people of Burma."Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from the cyclone, which is called Cyclone Nargis.As rescue workers reach the most hard hit areas of the storm, they only began to realize the damage it caused. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of Myanmar.Hundreds of thousands are homeless and another three thousand have been injured by the storm. Drinking water is contaminated and food is becoming scarce as the United Nations (U.N.) and other organizations try to get supplies to the region.Police in the United Kingdom have arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of being a serial killer. The man is being questioned over the death of one prostitute and the disappearances of two others in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England.The man was arrested on Monday after 36-year-old Suzanne Blamires vanished on Sunday. Body parts believed to be hers were found floating in a river yesterday afternoon, and police today announced they were questioning a man on suspicion of her murder and that of two missing prostitutes.The man, who lives in Bradford's red-light district, is facing questioning over the April 26 disappearance of Shelley Armitage, 31, and the June 2009 disappearance of Susan Rushworth, 43. This morning a magistrate granted West Yorkshire Police extra time to question the man, which will expire tomorrow evening.Rushworth was last seen on a double-decker bus heading to Thornton Road. She had three children, was addicted to heroin and suffered from epilepsy. Armitage was last seen on CCTV in the red-light district. She lived just three streets from Blamires and the two knew each other. Blamire's suspected remains were found in the River Aire in nearby Shipley by a member of public at 2:00 p.m. The area is being examined by forensics experts, crime officers and police divers. West Yorksire Police's homicide and major enquiries team is conducting the investigation. Police dogs have been used to search a drainage culvert and undergrowth on Thornton Road, and black bags from skips behind nearby halls of residence have been examined. Members of the police underwater search unit were also at work. Previously, separate searches have been held for Rushworth and Armitage.Assistant Chief Constable Jawaid Akhtar said the remains from the river are of a single unidentified woman. He said that all three women's families are being assisted by family liaison officers. Speaking at an on-scene press conference at the junction between Dockfield Road and Otley Road in Shipley, he described the investigation as "a very thorough and painstaking inquiry into three missing women, all of them sex workers, with all the necessary resources and expertise devoted to it."Some British media has compared the case to the serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, often referred to as the Yorkshire Ripper. Sutcliffe lived in Bradford and killed three of his thirteen victims there; he also attempted to murder seven more people before his 1981 conviction. Most of his victims were prostitutes.Police are in the process of evacuating Birmingham City Centre and part of the Ladywood residential district after having received intelligence regarding a possible threat. An estimated 20,000 people are being moved. Nightlife sites are being closed and people are being told to go home. The evacuation was begun at about 8.15 p.m. (1915 UTC) after the police issued a "Public Warning". Cars are being prohibited from entry inside the Inner Ring Road, and New Street railway station, the hub of the British passenger railway system has been closed. A police spokeswoman said that the investigation was 'proportional' to the threat, but refused to comment on details of the threat. "West Midlands police are now closing down the Broad Street entertainment zone and asking people to leave Birmingham town centre and go home," said the spokesman.BBC Radio Five Live and Sky News have unconfirmed reports of controlled explosions in the city's Chinatown district.A BBC News 24 correspondent reports that the Police have prevented motorists from returning to their cars and hundreds of city revellers are filing their way on foot along Bristol Road to converge on the Edgbaston Cricket Ground.In a press conference, West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Hyde said that the intelligence they received is not believed to be connected to Thursday's terrorist bombings in London.Earlier in the evening a controlled explosion on "a suspect package" had been carried out on a bus in Corporation Street, but they "no longer believe it was suspicious device".It appears that this was a hoax, unconfirmed reports on Australian Teleivision have reported. The evacuation order was lifted at about 6 a.m.Broad Street is the City's best-known entertainment area and is home to hundreds of bars and clubs.A policeman from the United Kingdom was killed today while taking part in a training exercise with his police force, in the city of Manchester.The policeman died as a result of a shot to the chest. The incident occurred at approximately 10:30 UTC (11:30 local time) this morning.Greater Manchester Police released a statement regarding the incident, saying that the officer was shot at Thorpe Road, which is found in the Newton Heath area of the city.HMS Superb, a navy submarine from the United Kingdom, crashed into rocks in the northern half of the Red Sea on May 26. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) released a statement saying, "there were no casualties and the submarine remains watertight, is safe on the surface and able to operate under its own power."The MoD also said that "the submarine's nuclear reactor is completely unaffected, and there is no environmental impact."BBC News has reported that an investigation will be launched to discover the cause of the incident.According to the MoD, "no other vessel, military or civil, was involved in the incident." The MoD has stated that the process of informing the relatives of the crew is underway.A train driver from the United Kingdom has had his conviction for manslaughter over a head-on rail collision in 1989 quashed. A train operated by Robert Morgan, 64, passed a red signal at Purley and struck an oncoming service on March 4, 1989, killing five and injuring 80 more.Morgan's train had been destined for London Victoria having left Littlehampton, but after passing through the red light struck a Horsham-to-Victoria train at 60mph.Morgan, of Ferring, West Sussex, was ultimately convicted of two counts of manslaughter over the accident to which he had earlier pled guilty, and was jailed in September 1990 for 18 months, of which 12 were suspended. A subsequent appeal reduced this sentence to four months. 47 years old at the time, Morgan had never had any previous problems during his 23 years driving trains.However, after his conviction it emerged that in the five years preceding the crash there had been four separate Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) incidents involving the same signal, signal T168. The last of these had itself almost resulted in an accident.The court was also told that had Morgan, who was unable to fully remember the collision due to his injuries, been aware of the previous problems at the time he would not have pled guilty to manslaughter.Lord Justice Latham said on Wednesday in the court of appeal that "The history of signal 168... would have been a significant factor in any jury's evaluation of the extent to which the appellant's fault could have been said to have gone from being negligent — breach of duty — to being the sort of breach of duty which justified the imposition of criminal sanctions." He went on to describe the information that had not been available at the original 1990 trial as of "considerable significance".He added that a further SPAD incident that occurred two years after the crash at the site, despite improvements designed to prevent a recurrence of the crash, showed that "something about the infrastructure of this particular junction was causing mistakes to be made. Had a jury known that, it is at the very least impossible for us to conclude that the jury would inevitably have nonetheless convicted the appellant of manslaughter. These facts would have all been matters which the jury would have taken into account when assessing the level of fault of Mr Morgan. There is no way that we can say accordingly that these convictions are safe. The position is that we allow the appeal against convictions."Latham acknowledged that Morgan had indeed made a mistake when he passed the signal at danger, but described the area surrounding signal T168 as "an accident waiting to happen".Morgan's legal team issued a statement from him describing him as "both delighted and relieved" that Lord Justice Latham and the two other judges had ruled his conviction unsafe.Solicitor Gary Rubin said: "It is unfortunate that at the time when this tragic accident occurred, the significance of this particular signal being passed at danger on four previous occasions was not properly understood. Due to this lack of understanding at the time, Mr Morgan was placed in a position where he had no alternative other than to plead guilty. The impact of the better understanding has been material to the [appeal] court taking the rare step of quashing a conviction where there had been an original guilty plea so long ago."Morgan told reporters outside the court "I am pleased that my conviction is squashed and my name is finally cleared. My thoughts will always remain with those who lost their loved ones."On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the calls by United Kingdom officials asking the United States to waive diplomatic immunity for Anne Sacoolas. Sacoolas, who has immunity as a diplomat's wife, was involved in a traffic collision which killed motorcyclist Harry Dunn on August 27. She subsequently left the UK and returned to the US.Prime Minister Johnson was questioned about the case while speaking to the press at a hospital in Watford. He said, "I think everybody's sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss. I must answer you directly, I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose."Johnson continued, "And I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. That's a point that we've raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly. And to anticipate a question you might want to raise, if we can't resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House." The White House refers to the United States president's office.Harry Dunn, a 19-year-old motorcyclist was struck by a Volvo XC90 driving on the wrong side of the road in Northamptonshire according to traffic camera footage. The crash happened around 8:30 p.m. BST (1930 UTC) on August 27. He died from his injuries at John Radcliffe Hospital a short time later. The wreck occurred near RAF Croughton which is a intelligence base used by both the Royal Air Force and the US Air Force.Northamptonshire police were able to determine the Volvo had come from RAF Croughton and spoke with Anne Sacoolas as a suspect. She informed police she had diplomatic immunity, but "that she had no plans to leave the country in the near future". Normally, only embassy workers — and their spouses — in London have diplomatic immunity, but in a 1994 agreement it was extended to all US workers at RAF Croughton.Despite the assurances, she and her husband Jonathan Socoolas left the country, police revealed on Saturday. Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley wrote to the US Embassy in London asking to waive her diplomatic immunity. Both he and the county's Police and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold, urged the immunity be waived. The embassy declined the request and said the Socoolas family left per advice from the United States Department of State.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the embassy to reconsider and spoke with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the case. The State Department gave its "deepest sympathies" and said immunity cases were afforded "intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry".Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said on TV, "She didn't purposely drive on the other side of the road... if she'd have stayed and faced us as a family we could have found that forgiveness... but forgiving her for leaving, I'm nowhere near." Charles told the Daily Mail, "All we need to do is ask her to come back. It’s not much to ask. She’s left a family in complete ruin. We’re broken."A passenger plane broke apart and caught fire after an emergency landing yesterday at Donetsk International Airport in eastern Ukraine, causing at least five fatalities. Twelve were also injured in the incident, although "most of the survivors were able to walk off the plane by themselves" according to Svytlana Borodyna, an emergency ministry spokesperson.Russia-based news service RT said an early report indicated 45 people on the plane, which is an Antonov An-24 turboprop. However, Borodyna said there were 44 people on the 44-seater aircraft.The aircraft reportedly came to rest in a field, approximately 700 metres off the runway. Its undercarriage broke, and it overturned and split in three. Multiple ambulances were sent to the scene.The state emergency service said because the bodies of the deceased "sustained severe burns", they have not been identified. "There are a lot of injured," the statement added. Andrey Shishatsky, the governor of the Donetsk region, said "one man can be seen in the rubble but we do not know whether he is alive or not." One other person, a flight attendant, may have been in the back end of the plane when it crash landed and is unaccounted for. 39 people have been rescued, according to the state emergency service, and subsequently transported to an airport terminal building.The cause of the crash landing is unclear thus far. However, thick fog conditions were reported in Donetsk at the time. Whether the aircraft overshot the runway or skidded is also uncertain.During 2011, Dmitry Medvedev — at that time the President of Russia — requested a halt to the use of Antonov An-24s, which are considered non-compliant with Ukraine's current aircraft requirements; they lack an aerial object radar alert system.The available information about the phosphorous cloud following the railway accident in the Ukraine last Monday is becoming more and more cryptic.The political involvement of most media and other factors are causing contradictions among official sources that are making press work extremely hard. Moreover, no one is permitted to enter the accident location. The site of the accident was closed to visitors following the injury of three TV journalists who got too close.An explosion in a coal mine has killed at least 80 people in the city of Donetsk, Ukraine, while 20 people are reported missing.According to reports transmitted by the local press and the Emergency Situations Department, 360 miners managed to get to the surface safely; 28 others are currently hospitalized, some with severe burns.The Zasyadko mine is nearly 1,000 meters deep, and 457 people were in the mine when the explosion occurred at 3:11 am.The cause of the explosion is still unknown. Initial reports suggest that the explosion was caused by methane mixing with the air in the mine.During the afternoon, more than thirty rescue teams were found at the scene, wearing hard hats and oxygen tanks as they prepared to enter the mine.Relatives of the victims gathered around the entrance to the mine, awaiting news of their loved ones. Officials read the names of those confirmed as dead.The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, responded to the scene; the president of the country, Viktor Yushchenko, will visit the area this Monday.  "I am grieving with all of Ukraine", declared the Ukrainian head of state. He also criticized the government, saying that the mining industry has been a victim of "insufficient efforts".With obsolete installations and poor construction, Ukraine has been a victim of various mining accidents in the past. According to union estimations, between 2006 and 2007 nearly 250 miners died in accidents.An alarm for heavy chemical pollution has been issued in the Lviv region, Ukraine, where yesterday evening a railway disaster led to a fire involving 15 containers of liquid yellow phosphorus. Extinguishing the fire proved extremely difficult because water cannot be used: in contact with phosphorus, water creates poisonous gas. It took six hours before the flames were extinguished. Gas was generated nonetheless, and at the moment the poisoned area extends about 90 sq. km. The casualties count is already heavy: 20 people are reported injured, 13 of them in critical condition. They have been carried to the Lviv hospital. Podrobnosti reports that the fire started when one of the containers started to leak and the phosphor caught fire.The poisoned area includes 14 villages. From the five villages that are closer to the disaster area some 800 people have already been evacuated. Half of the evacuees had to manage on their own as there was not enough public transport for all.At the moment there is no available data about the wind direction or next expected movements of the phosphorus cloud. Special firemen units remain on place to control the possibility of a new fire, while the administration of the Lviv Oblast tries to forecast the possible short- and mid-term evolution of the situation. The Ukrainian Railways have officially excluded the possibility of a terrorist act as a cause for the disaster.Podrobnosti reports the deadly dose of yellow phosphor at  0.1 g. According to that source, when poisoning living beings, phosphor causes liver necrosis and attacks the bones and spinal cord.A United Nations (UN) aid plane in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has crashed, killing all seventeen passengers on board. According to a spokesperson for the organisation "The plane was found 15 kilometres (eight miles) northwest of Bukavu airport. There were 15 passengers and two crew on board."Air Serv International, the operator of the aircraft, said that it did not believe there to be any survivors.  They also said in the statement that "the staff of Air Serv International express their condolences and deepest sympathy to the families of the passengers and crew."The UN has identified the victims as a Canadian member of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), an Indian who worked for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid, two members of Medecins Sans Frontiers, one from France and one from the Republic of Congo.The other thirteen were citizens of the DRC. Two were employees of Air Serv and were the crew. Four were with the UNDP and another four were civil servants, while the last three worked for Handicap International. The UN spokesperson also said that "the helicopter landed far away [from the wreckage] and the search and rescue team headed to the site on foot."The plane was on a journey from Kinshasa to Goma, with stops at Mbandaka, Kisangani and Bukavu.Air crashes are common in the DRC and, as a result, Congolese airliners are banned from flying in the airspace of countries in the European Union.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) called on the international community to increase aid and assistance to the two countries shouldering the bulk of displaced Iraqis. Syria and Jordan have received the largest number of Iraqi refugees and are having difficulty coping with the numbers. The appeal was made by UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond at a press conference on Friday at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. He criticized governments for earlier expressing concern and pledging support for the refugees but not following through on promises. "Syria and Jordan have still received next to nothing in bilateral help from the world community," said Redmond.There are an estimated 2 million Iraqi refugees total in Syria and Jordan with the numbers increasing daily. Each day, Syria receives approximately 2,000 Iraqis and, of those, about 1,000 will stay for an extended time. There are a further 2 million displaced Iraqis who move and settle in safer areas within Iraq.The large numbers of refugees is putting pressure on the infrastructure of the host countries, resulting in difficult living conditions for the inhabitants. Ron Redmond acknowledges that some US$70 million in donations have been received by the UNHCR, and a further $10 million promised since the Iraq displacement conference in April, 2007. He points out, however, that much more is required. "We stressed then and we say it again, donors must provide direct bilateral support to these host countries whose schools, hospitals, public services and infrastructure are seriously overstretched because of the presence of millions of Iraqis they have so generously welcomed," said Redmond.Schools are particularly difficult to set up and staff in a refugee situation. Syria has currently hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugee children, but only has resources for 32,000 students. Syria offers free access to public schools for refugees, but doesn't have the infrastructure to cope. Some 14,000 Iraqi refugee children in Jordan attend school, out of the possible 250,000. The refugee children in Jordan don't have access to public schools and instead go to private schools. UNHCR is partnering with UNICEF to provide 150,000 classroom spots in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, but the coordination of the required resources, such as buildings, teachers, and school supplies is proving difficult.Health issues for the refugees is also a concern. UNHCR has set up three primary care medical facilities in Syria, with two more in the works. But approximately 10,000 Iraqis per month require a doctor's attention, 3,000 of which require serious medical treatment."It is unconscionable that generous host countries be left on their own to deal with such a huge crisis," said Ron Redmond at the press conference. "We strongly urge governments to step forward now to support them in dealing with this situation and renew our call for international solidarity and burden sharing."The president of Refugees International, Ken Bacon, agrees that a more comprehensive approach to the situation is required and believes that it would be good investment for the United States to increase its aid to the region. "The United States ought to be pumping money into Jordan and Syria," Bacon suggests. He feels that the sheer numbers of refugees can have a destabilizing influence in the Middle East. However, the complicated diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Syria has resulted in slow progress, according to Bacon, as bilateral discussions have not taken place and the UN is forced to mediate.After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief. Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments. In the meantime, some relief is delayed, and people die. Money that does eventually come may not be in proportion to the need. For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 tsunami generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now 75% underfunded. To help solve these problems, the United Nations this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters."We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters," said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on March 9.Jan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. "We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much," he said. "Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."The biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway. The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands.After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief.

For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 tsunami generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now 75% underfunded.To help solve these problems, the United Nations this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters."We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters," said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on March 9.Jan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. "We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much," he said. "Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."The biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway. The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands.A suspected suicide bomb blast hit the offices of the United Nations' World Food Program in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, on Monday, killing three people, including at least one foreigner. Several people were also wounded.Security officials blocked off the building in a high security zone in Islamabad, as teams with sniffer dogs entered the complex to check for more explosives. Pakistani authorities said that they strengthened security in the capital following the attack.Speaking to the Voice of America news agency by telephone shortly after the blast, World Food Program spokesman for Pakistan Amjed Jamal said, "what I can confirm is that there was a blast, there was something planted already in the office, which [blew] up, and that my colleagues are injured."  Police say the dead include two Pakistani women and an Iraqi national.Jamal said that despite the violence, his organization would continue to help those in need in Pakistan. "I can confidently say such acts cannot hamper humanitarian work in Pakistan."No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but militants have targeted UN offices in the past. In June, a senior Pakistani officer with the UN's refugee agency was killed in an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt near Peshawar.Since his death, UNHCR has suspended the voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees living in camps in Pakistan.The WFP offices are located on a street that already has high security due to other nearby United Nations offices. Also, across the main road is Pakistani President Asif Ali Zadari's civilian residence, which is a hub for political activity in the capital.A plane belonging to the United Nations has crashed in Haiti, reports said. The UN says that all on board the plane have been killed.The plane, a CASA C-212 Aviocar, crashed on Friday afternoon about 45 kilometres from the country's capital of Port-au-Prince, near the border with the Dominican Republic."The aircraft was on a regular reconnaissance flight," said UN spokeswoman Michele Montas in a statement.All bodies were found at the crash site, the UN said, and the victims were military personnel from Uruguay and Jordan.The plane belonged to the Uruguayan contingent of MINUSTAH, a 9,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti. It has been in the country since 2004.An investigation into the cause of the incident has been launched by the UN.The UN has proposed the formation of the International Early Warning Programme (IEWP), with the suggestion that it would have greatly limited the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunamis.The system would analyse data from all over the world and rapidly transmit warnings. It would also feature a population training element, to make sure people know what to do upon hearing warnings or to teach them to recognize danger signs.“This new programme will help bring safety, security and peace of mind,” stated the Director of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), Sálvano Briceno, at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Japan.The system, first proposed two years ago, has been given new impetus by the recent disaster in the Indian Ocean. It will warn against many types of natural disaster including wildfires, floods, droughts, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis.The Program will see many existing UN programs working together, including the World Food Program, the World Meteological Program, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). One third of the people the World Food Program helps are the victims of natural disasters.The system will be built around better, more open flow of regional data and the formulation of local warning plans.As reported the United Nations, January 12 Haiti earthquake left exactly 222,570 deaths, 1,300,000 refugees in harbours, 766,000 displaced people, 310,000 injured and 869 disappeared. The report also mentioned economic loss suffered by the country, that reached 7.754 billion dollars, leaving 71 percent of the Haitians in extreme poverty.The document was diffused in Santo Domingo de Guzmán, between the preparatives of a conference about the reconstruction of Haiti, that will take place next March 11 in New York.Haitian Government representatives have asked to donors an additional help of 350 million dollars for the Haiti reconstruction, the most poor country in the Americas.The damages report was prepared by the Haitian Government with the support of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank, the United Nations and the European Union.Aid from the United Nations has started to reach Myanmar after a recent cyclone in the region killed tens of thousands. The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon released a statement regarding the delivery of aid to Myanmar:Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of the country.The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.An unarmed man was killed by a New York City Police Department Narcotics Enforcement officer at his home in the Williamsbridge neighborhood of The Bronx, New York on Thursday, according to police. 18-year-old Ramarley Graham was pronounced dead at nearby Montefiore Medical Center. He was shot by a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. The incident is currently being investigated by Internal Affairs, and a grand jury investigation is expected into whether criminal charges should be filed against the officers involved.The incident began with Mr. Graham walking on the street near his East 229th Street home, police say. He was approached by plain cloths officers in NYPD marked raid jackets. The officers were investigating suspected drug sales at a bodega. As they were approaching, Graham fled on foot towards his home and was followed by the officers. After officers followed him into the building, he entered the bathroom. An officer ordered Graham to "Show me your hands! Show me your hands!" After he failed to comply, the officer shot Graham once in the chest.There were no weapons found on Graham's person or at the scene. There was a small bag of cannabis in the toilet.Police said the officer who shot Graham and his supervising sergeant have been placed on modified duty in light of the incident. The names of the officers were not released, but the officer who shot Graham is said to be 30 years old and joined the NYPD in 2008.Police commissioner Raymond Kelly said "We're obviously trying to get the facts. A young man's life was taken. ... It's the worst thing that can happen to a parent — to lose a child." Mayor Michael Bloomberg said "We obviously have some real concerns [about the incident]."This was the third time within a week a young man had died in a police-involved shooting in New York City. 22-year-old Christopher Kissane was killed in an alleged carjacking in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn and 17-year-old Antwain White was killed in an alleged mugging in Bushwick, Brooklyn.An undetonated bomb, reportedly from World War II, has been discovered at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. One runway, the closest to the bomb, has been closed as a result, and delays are expected on all flights. Heavy fog has compounded the problem and is expected to cause further delays. The 255kg bomb was discovered by workers from the town of Vijfhuizen, which is about 5km from the airport.  According to the Dutch national traffic bureau, ANWB, "The projectile is sensitive to vibrations, is not in a settled position, and is possibly live."Automobile traffic near the area has been stopped and several houses have been evacuated.  Schiphol Airport is Amsterdam's primary airport and one of Europe's largest hubs.Bombs and mines continue to be found throughout the Netherlands even though World War II ended sixty years ago. Earlier this year in April, three fishermen were killed when their ship exploded from hauling an old bomb onboard that had been caught in the net.United Airlines Flight 634 made an emergency landing yesterday morning when only two of the three landing wheels on the Airbus A319 deployed as the plane was making its final approach into Newark, New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport. After multiple attempts to fix the problem failed, the pilot decided that an emergency landing was the only remaining choice.Only the plane's nose gear and left landing gear had descended. The right landing gear would not release. The airliner made a go-around as the crew attempted to fix the problem. Passenger Jim Falk knew something was wrong saying, "Normally a big plane like that doesn't do a bypass, so we knew something was wrong." However, the pilot decided that nothing could be done to bring the gear down, and an emergency landing was declared.  "We are going to have an unusual landing," the pilot calmly announced to the 53 passengers seated on the plane, according to passenger Moritz Loew. Another passenger, Paul Lasiuk said he was more shocked than scared, telling himself, "You have no choice.  You're going to go through this.""Brace! Brace! Brace!", the pilot announced over the plane's public address system, calling for passengers to enter the brace position as the plane made a touchdown on the runway at Newark. The plane touched down on the nose wheel and left rear wheel before lurching to the right causing sparks to fly as the right engine skidded along the runway. Eventually, the plane came to stop at 9:27 A.M. EDT.Afterward, passengers and crew evacuated the plane by sliding down the evacuation slides and moving quickly away from the plane. They were then taken by bus to the airline's lounge where they told their stories to investigators and waited for their luggage. Three passengers reported minor injuries but refused treatment.The emergency landing caused the airport to shut down for 20 minutes, but service quickly resumed on two of the airports three runways. The plane remained on the runway throughout the afternoon as investigators determined the cause of the landing gear failure. This is in contrast to last week, when the airport was shutdown for six hours after a young man named Haisong Jiang breached security by passing through an exit to kiss his girlfriend goodbye.According to passengers, the crew remained calm during the ordeal. Jim Falk said, "They did a great job. There was no yelling, screaming, panicking or anything." Falk said he wanted to buy a bottle of champagne for the currently unnamed pilot. Falk added, "The pilot did a beautiful job. He didn’t put it in the water like the other pilot did, but he should be commended." Martin Trebino, a spokesperson for United Airlines said they would not release the pilot's name on Sunday, but did not indicate when his name would be made available either.Paul Lasiuk said, "I've had a lot of worse landings at Newark before. It was unbelievably smooth."Moritz Loew joked with himself afterward saying, "What's a great landing? One that you walk away from."The flight, which left Chicago's O'Hare International Airport early Sunday morning around 6 A.M. reported no other problems during the flight up until the incident. According to United Airlines spokesperson Robin Urbanski, it remains unclear why the landing gear failed to deploy. Urbanski added that passengers' tickets would be refunded and that they would receive vouchers and credit towards any future flight.A United Nations (UN) team assessed the damage from an early December oil spill in Sundarbans, Bangladesh, to the world's largest mangrove forest. Team leader Emilia Wahlstrom yesterday presented preliminary assessment results at a press conference in the capital, Dhaka.The 25-member UN team arrived in Bangladesh on December 18 and visited the Sundarbans from December 22 to December 27.At the press conference, Wahlstrom said the pollution was spread 40 kilometers up and downstream, but no impact on the mangrove forest floor was observed. She said the Pashur and Shela rivers contributed by washing some of the oil. She also suggested a ban on water traffic in the area, saying "regular monitoring and stopping traffic through the Sundarbans are needed to tackle the long-term impact."Anwar Hossain Manju, Minister for Forest and Environmental Affairs of Bangladesh, acknowledged that vessel traffic in Sundarbans was suspended. He also said "alternative options" were "being explored".Wahlstrom also commented cleanup by local villagers removed about a fifth of the oil spill.On December 9, the OT Southern Star 7 tanker sank in an accident with another vessel. Reportedly visibility was poor due to thick fog. OT Southern Star 7 was carrying about 350,000 L of fuel oil.Sundarbans is a World Heritage Site. The UN plans to release a final report in two weeks.The United Nations has called for wealthy donor nations to donate US$700 million (£382 million or €484 million) in emergency aid for Eastern Africa to prevent widespread famine. Since the start of 2008 the number of people living in hunger in the region has almost doubled to seventeen million, according to the UN.UN emergency relief co-ordinator John Holmes states that food levels are dangerously low in much of Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea, Northern Kenya and Uganda. The area, known as the 'Horn of Africa', has seen drought, war and high food prices all worsen the situation. Holmes has warned that the levels of those in need could rise still further.A total of $1.4 billion is to be raised for the period from now to the year's end, but at least $716 million of that remains to be found. "We may need significant funds after that period - this is not the end of the story," warned Holmes."We can avoid the situations of the 1980s and the 1990s which were genuine famines at different times. But we do need extra resources, very quickly indeed if we are going to avoid going back to famine situations," he said. He says Ethiopia and Somalia are in the worst states, with six million Ethiopians requiring emergency support and 43% of Somalia's population in a similar predicament.He described locals saying that the situation has never been as bad since 1928, when vast amounts of livestock died. They say rain is needed within the next few months if there is to be any grazing and cereal crops are impossible in the near future, it being well into 2009 before anything may be ready to harvest.The number of hungry people in the world rose by 75 million last year to 925 million. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says high food prices are to blame for the crisis.On Tuesday, the first major rain storm of the year in Southern California led to flooding that has caused at least fifteen deaths, mainly in Santa Barbara County. The flooding was exacerbated by last month's wildfires; particularly hard-hit was the wealthy community of Montecito, downstream of the site of the Thomas Fire, where at least six houses were destroyed. More than 160 people have been hospitalized, four in critical condition.According to the United States National Weather Service, five and a half inches of rain has fallen over two days in parts of Ventura County, and more than four inches in parts of Santa Barbara County. In areas burned by the wildfires, ground cover that would have reduced runoff had been destroyed, and an impermeable layer of ash and burned soil had been created. As a result, torrents of mud ran downhill and inundated places such as Montecito. Mike Eliason, a spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, said homes in the wealthy community had been "wiped away from their foundations" by mudflows, which also burst a gas main, leading to a fire that destroyed another building.Sections of the 101 freeway were closed by flooding; a driver told television station KTLA that mud came "out of nowhere" and covered the highway in "about five seconds" and that he was glad he was still alive. James Cook, the Los Angeles correspondent for BBC News, reported that roads were being blocked by "boulders the size of small cars" which had tumbled down the hills. BBC also reported, 300 people had been trapped in Romero Canyon. Bill Brown, the Sheriff of Santa Barbara County, said at mid-afternoon that the number of deaths had reached thirteen and might rise. He described the flood-ravaged areas as looking "like a World War I battlefield" and said that emergency dispatchers had fielded some 600 calls between 3:00 and 6:00 am.Emergency services including the Ventura County Aviation Unit were kept busy rescuing people. The Coast Guard sent aircraft to assist. Spokesmen reported fifty people had been rescued in each of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara Counties. Montecito resident, Berkeley Johnson, told the Santa Barbara Independent that he and his wife had taken refuge on the roof of their house but climbed came down when they heard a child crying. With a fireman's help were able to dig out a two-year-old girl, who looked like a "muddy doll" according to Johnson.Officials issued evacuation orders on Monday for thousands of people living in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and Ventura counties, but Montecito was under only voluntary evacuation. Some of the evacuation orders were lifted later on Tuesday as the rain became lighter.On Tuesday, an engine cowling of a United Airlines airliner flying from San Francisco to Honolulu, in Hawaii, flew off over the Pacific Ocean, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.The Boeing 777-200 two-engine jet left San Francisco International Airport shortly after 9:00 am PST (1700 UTC) and was flying the scheduled United Flight 1175 when there was a sound described by one passenger, Maria Falaschi, as "a big bang". Pieces of the right-side engine assembly could be seen blowing in the wind. Passengers said the plane landed 40 or 45 minutes later, during which time they said it shook "violently", "sound[ing] a lot like being inside an unbalanced washing machine" as one posted to Instagram. Many took pictures and videos; one later told ABC News: "I thought we were going to die and hoped that my kids knew that I loved them". She said the flight attendants also appeared afraid. Falaschi said it was the "scariest flight of my life".The plane landed at 2:42 pm PST; there were no reported injuries. United issued a statement saying the engine cowling had come off because of a "mechanical issue" and that passengers had "deplaned normally" after "pilots followed all necessary protocols to safely land the aircraft" and "taxied to the gate". The statement also said the company would be contacting all the passengers and "plan to fully refund every ticket".On Sunday, a boat ferrying people to a floating casino in the Gulf of Mexico caught fire and burned near New Port Richey, Florida, US. All 50 passengers aboard abandoned ship and jumped into the sea, but one died in hospital that evening.Beth Fifer, assistant chief executive of the Tropical Breeze Casino Cruise, said that the fire started at about 3:30 PM, local time, as the boat was outbound to the casino. According to Gerard DeCanio, the police chief of Port Richey, the captain saw smoke coming from the engine and turned back, then grounded the boat in shallow water. The boat was rapidly engulfed in flames. Those aboard had to jump about ten feet into waist-high water and swim or wade ashore to safety. The police said that about fifteen were treated at local hospitals, including for possible hypothermia from exposure to the cold sea water. The one fatality, a 42-year-old woman, went to the emergency room at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point hours later and died at 10:42 p.m., according to Kurt Conover, a spokesman for the medical center and Kevin Doll, a spokesman for the Pasco County Sheriff's Office.Passenger Qaadia Culbreath told WFLA-TV that he couldn't swim and didn't see any life jackets, so he found himself "dangling off the metal hanger in the front of the boat because I didn't want to let go". Andrew Fossa, deputy fire chief of Pasco County, described locals who assisted the passengers as they scrambled to shore as "phenomenal".According to police chief DeCanio, the boat captain had reported engine trouble on earlier trips. Fifer said, "It would've never left the dock if we knew something was wrong with it." The Coast Guard has announced that they will review maintenance records. The casino operates offshore, requiring a boat to ferry gamblers to and fro, because casino gambling is not legal in the state of Florida.On Sunday, the head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, described the erroneous alert, sent on Saturday, warning of an imminent nuclear missile strike, as an "absolutely unacceptable" mistake by the Emergency Management Agency of the state of Hawaii. He emphasized that the FCC would "focus on what steps need to be taken to prevent a similar incident from happening again."At 8:07 am local time on Saturday, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA) sent out the following alert: "BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL." It appeared on people's mobile phones throughout the state and caused widespread panic. It took 38 minutes for the state to retract the warning, which Pai said made the error worse. Vern Miyagi, the HI-EMA's administrator, stated that an employee had mistakenly sent out the alert during a test performed at shift change. On Sunday, Cindy McMillan, communications director for state governor David Ige, clarified that after accidentally pressing the button to send the alert, the employee had gone on to accidentally confirm the command. Richard Rapoza, spokesperson for HI-EMA, said the employee had since been reassigned.Pai said that FCC analysis of the incident showed that the state had failed to put "reasonable safeguards or process controls" in place to prevent a false alert from being sent. According to The New York Times, the state will now require two people to authorize the issuance of an alert. Also, a "cancellation template" will be created to solve the problem of quickly sending corrections over the mobile phone networks.Both HI-EMA administrator Miyagi and Hawaii governor Ige apologized for the mistake, with Ige saying "I, too, am extremely upset about this." Tulsi Gabbard, a House Representative from Hawaii, referred to an "epic failure of leadership" in an interview with ABC News.Tests by North Korea of missiles that, according to a report in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, could strike Hawaii 20 minutes after launch have heightened tensions in the state. Air raid sirens used in the Cold War have been reactivated there.Early on Sunday morning, Amtrak's passenger train number 91, the Silver Star, bound for Miami from New York, slammed into a stationary CSX freight train in Cayce, about ten miles (16 km) south of Columbia, capital of the US state of South Carolina.  Two Amtrak employees were killed and at least 116 were injured, some seriously.The two killed were 54-year-old engineer Michael Kempf of Savannah, Georgia, and 36-year-old conductor Michael Cella of Orange Park, Florida.  Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a press conference the passenger train had been diverted into a siding by a switch left "literally locked, with a padlock" in that position.The collision happened at about 2:35 am local time (0735 UTC) at a switching yard in the small city of Cayce. The Amtrak train, with reportedly 139 passengers and eight employees aboard, collided head on with the freight train, which was parked with no one on board. The Amtrak locomotive and the leading locomotive on the freight train were destroyed; the Amtrak locomotive and some of its passenger cars derailed, and one of those cars was folded in half. Several freight cars were crumpled, Reuters reported. In a press conference, the state governor, Henry McMaster, said the Amtrak locomotive was "barely recognizable" and described it as "a horrible thing to see, to understand the force involved". Harrison Cahill, a spokesman for Lexington County, gave a count of 116 injured, up from an initial report of 70; according to Derrec Becker, public information officer for the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, injuries ranged "from cuts and bruises to severe broken bones". On Monday a Palmetto Health spokesperson said two patients were in serious and two in critical condition at their facilities. A spill of approximately 5,000 gallons of fuel from the freight train posed no safety hazard, according to officials.Passenger Derek Pettaway told the CNN network that like most others, he had been sleeping when the collision happened. He said Amtrak staff cleared the passengers from the train rapidly, and there was no panic; "I think people were more in shock than anything else", he said."Key to this investigation is learning why the switch was lined that way", Sumwalt said. Amtrak's CEO, Richard Anderson, speaking to reporters on Sunday, held CSX responsible; he stated the track in that area is operated by CSX and the signals, which CSX operates, were not working at the time of the collision and a CSX dispatcher was therefore directing the Amtrak train's movements. Sumwalt noted an automatic monitoring and braking system called positive train control, which was not in use on the stretch of line, could have forestalled the collision.Several fatal incidents involving Amtrak trains have occurred in the past three months. On December 18, the inaugural train on a new route in Washington state derailed at high speed while crossing above a highway, killing three; on January 31, the driver of a garbage truck was killed in Virginia when he collided with an Amtrak train chartered to take Republican lawmakers to a retreat.The University of Chicago's Joe and Rika Mansueto Library was shut down by a power outage for a short time on Saturday, preventing library personnel from providing full services to its patrons. The US$81 million library, which opened May 16, includes a 180-seat reading room under a 691-panel glass dome. Five stories underground, a system of five cranes retrieves books sorted into bins, carrying a maximum of about 3.5 million volumes. As of 3:50 p.m. CDT, the automated storage and retrieval system, along with staff computers at the circulation desk, were shut down, preventing patrons from retrieving materials stored underground. The glass ceiling normally allows enough natural light to pass, but rain clouds in the area darkened the room. Patrons began to flip light switches in front of their seats, but to no avail, and a circulation clerk announced that there had been a power outage. Some patrons then moved to the adjacent Regenstein Library, which still had power. Power was still running along the corridor linking Mansueto and Regenstein Libraries, along with the nearby restrooms and Special Collections Research Center.An electrician arrived at the building at around 3:50 p.m., and power had been restored by 5:45 p.m.University of Memphis football player Taylor Bradford died after being the victim of what police are calling a targeted attack. The shooting occurred near a campus housing complex Sunday night at 9:45 p.m. (10:45 EST)Bradford hailed from Nashville, Tennessee and transferred to Memphis in 2006.Following the shooting, Bradford got into his car and attempted to drive away before crashing a short distance away. Regional Medical Center Memphis spokeswoman Sandy Snell said Bradford was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead shortly after 10:15 p.m. University President Shirley Raines said the student body was notified at 3:44 a.m. via a mass text message. Raines also said, "This was an act directed specifically toward the victim and it was not a random act of violence."No suspects have been named in the shooting.The campus was locked down for a short time following the shooting of the 21-year-old junior defensive lineman. University spokesman Curt Gunther said classes were canceled as a precaution.The University's football team, The Memphis Tigers, will play tomorrow night at home against Marshall University, as scheduled. The team's head coach Tommy West said, "Our entire football team is deeply saddened by the loss of Taylor... He was well respected and a popular member of our team."Classes are expected to resume on Tuesday, and police say that the investigation will continue.The Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has announced it will take the unprecedented step of conducting a special review of flag carrier Qantas after three separate emergencies in two weeks.In the latest incident, a Boeing 767 headed from Sydney to Manila was forced to turn back yesterday after ground staff at the airport noticed what they believed to be smoke emanating from the jet's wing as it departed. It turned out to be fine spray from a hydraulic fluid leak, and the aircraft brought its 200 passengers back down safely at around 3:00 p.m., with ARFF trucks on standby.Despite the aircraft being forced to turn around, the pilot did not request a priority landing and so Qantas refused to describe the event as an emergency landing.Qantas has a largely good safety record, having never lost a jet aircraft or had a fatality on board one. Their last fatal accident was in 1951. However, recently two other events have led to some questioning of Qantas from within the aviation industry.Last Monday, a Qantas Boeing 737-800 returned to Adelaide after experiencing pressurization problems caused by the failure of an undercarriage door to retract properly. This followed the July 25 accident on board Flight 30, a Boeing 747 headed from London to Melbourne that had just made a stopover in Hong Kong, in which an exploding oxygen cylinder caused an explosive decompression. An emergency landing was performed in Manila, with a hole blown in the aircraft's side.According to Qantas staff, the problems are not a new thing. Qantas flight attendants have asked senior management for an emergency meeting over these latest events. The Flight Attendants' Association of Australia's president Steven Reed said "We want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents. Or are they something we should be concerned about? We need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances." Such a meeting is said to be likely within a week.Qantas engineers have been complaining for some time about maintenance issues, saying that cost-cutting and outsourcing are compromising the quality of maintenance. Much work is now being done in countries such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. According to one engineering union official, recent incidents linked to outsourced maintenance include a failure of emergency lighting and flight attendants in the galley being electrocuted by faulty wiring.According to the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers' Association's assistant federal secretary, Wayne Vasta, there has been a recent "change in culture" at Qantas, although he did say it would be inappropriate to blame only outsourcing. He said that while previously Qantas engineers had simply attempted to do the best they could, "Now it appears we have got to do the best job we can possibly do, within a budget." He also expressed a welcoming of the CASA probe.Qantas' engineers are currently lobbying for a pay rise, and say the airline is risking safety with cost cuts.Peter Gibson, spokesperson for CASA, said no trouble had been spotted in recent safety audits of Qantas, but they felt it 'prudent' to investigate given the recent string of incidents. He acknowledged that the review is unprecedented in CASA's history, and announced the probe would be headed by senior official Mick Quinn."We want to look at their safety systems to make sure that the systems are operating the way they should. All these things are stated in manuals. We want to make sure that what is in the manuals is being done," Gibson told reporters. He said the investigation should take around two weeks.The University of Western Sydney (UWS), in New South Wales, Australia, has guaranteed around seven hundred Year 12 Higher School Certificate (HSC) students, whose studies were disrupted due to the devastating New South Wales bushfires, an undergraduate position through a recently announced program.Students from the Blue Mountains and Lithgow areas have been offered a chance to further their studies through the university's "Blue Mountains Staying on Track" program. Places are offered on all the university's campuses, with a A$2,000 scholarship offered to students whose houses were destroyed.According to pro vice-chancellor Angelo Kourtis, the devastation experienced by 45 current UWS students motivated the university's initiative. "The University was moved by the impact of the fires on our own staff and students and we paused to think about how this might be affecting students who are currently doing the HSC", he said, continuing, "The stress that students would be feeling around HSC time would have been amplified by this tragedy [...] The impact on their preparations would have been severely compromised by the fires."UWS Vice-Chancellor Janice Reid similarly remarked, "Studying the HSC and applying to university can be stressful enough without the additional stress of worrying about your family and your home." She said this generation of students should not be exempt from the same educational opportunities as its predecessors due to the unfortunate circumstances.Eight schools closed during the fires, with some students evacuated mid-exams. Some students abandoned study to help protect their homes, or to join with the firefighters.Eighteen-year-old Antonia Vial from Winmalee High School lost her family home, destroying not only irreplaceable belongings, but also study notes and material. "The worst part was probably just missing that feeling of coming home to relax, it was all exhausting and you didn't even have that alone time," Antonia said. "It's kind of unfair... but this offer definitely makes me feel a lot more safe and secure. It gets rid of that extra worry that's on everyone's mind."Although there is the option to apply for academic consideration through the Board of Studies, according to eighteen-year-old Clare Belfanti, "the guaranteed offer lifted a massive weight off your shoulders."The UWS program offers courses including arts, nursing, business, policing, science, engineering, computing and teaching, and to Janice Reid, it is important for the students to have this variety of displicines available."Higher education provides a strong foundation on which people can fulfill their aspirations, build their career, support themselves and their families and — perhaps most importantly for the years ahead — for communities to grow."When Blue Mountains Mayor Mark Greenhill heard of the university's plan, he said, he was "completely and utterly speechless," continuing "this is not just a statement about these students [...] it is a statement of support for the entire community of the Blue Mountains".As many as 140 people are feared dead after a boat sank on the Kasai River, a tributary of the Congo River, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The central African country, of equivalent size to western Europe, has very poor road infrastructure, meaning that many people travel on boats, which are often overloaded. The boat involved in the accident was travelling to the capital city, Kinshasa, from the town of Mushie. The accident occurred in the province of Bandundu, approximately 30 km (20 miles) from the provincial capital, where officials reportedly held a crisis meeting to deal with the incident.The boat is believed to have been overweight, carrying at least 180 passengers as well as goods.  It is the dry season in the Congo, so the river is shallow.  The sinking was reportedly the result of hitting a mud bank, causing the vessel to capsize. Lambert Mende, the Congolese information minister, said in a statement that at least 80 people had been confirmed dead while 76 were thought to have survived. However, the local police later announced a provisional death toll of 138, and possibly more.Safety standards are poor in the Democratic Republic, with overcrowding common on boats, which often do not carry lifejackets and are forced to navigate poorly marked waterways, meaning that fatal accidents are not uncommon in the country.File:Haram 4.jpgUp to 10 Iranian workers have been killed after a gas pipeline exploded, reports suggest.  Iranian state media have said that the pipeline, which transports gas from the Khangiran refinery in Sarakhs to the city of Mashhad in Iran's northeastern province of Khorasan-e Razavi, exploded on Saturday, and at least ten workers were transported to hospital, where they died of their injuries.   The director of the National Iranian Oil Company, Alireza Gharibi, said in an interview that "nine to ten people were killed in the Sarakhs pipeline blast." 50 others are reported to have been injured by the explosion, which sparked a large fire that has now been brought under control. After the initial incident, a number of workers with severe burns were taken to hospitals by helicopters. Gharibi stated that the explosion occurred while contractors were constructing a separate pipeline, which is to run nearby to the pipeline involved. The explosion is believed to have occurred when a construction vehicle lost balance and struck the pipeline.Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Javad Oji has said that the damaged pipeline will begin transporting gas again in the next couple of days. An investigation has begun into the cause of the disaster. According to the Associated Press, "Iran is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and also sits on the world's second largest natural gas reserves and the country's economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues."Two nine-month-old babies were hospitalised after appearing to be mauled by a fox as they slept in cots in their home in Hackney, West London, United Kingdom. The attack happened on Saturday at 22:00 BST (21:00 UTC). It is thought the fox entered through an open door on the ground floor of the house, which was located beside Victoria Park].The babies both suffered bite wounds on their arms, while one was also bitten on the face. Both are said to be in "serious but stable" conditions.The babies' mother, Pauline Koupparis, spoke of her shock to hear and see the foxes in her house to local BBC radio station London 94.9: "It's something I would never have expected to happen — let alone to us and my beautiful girls.  It was quite muffled but very pained.  I went into the room and I saw some blood in Isabella's cot, I thought she had a nosebleed.  I put on the light, I saw the fox, it just looked at me and it wasn't even scared of me.  I started screaming as I realised Lola was also covered in blood."Hackney environmental health officers set traps in the rear garden of the property the night after the attack, and a fox was caught; this was humanely killed shortly after midnight.  It is not yet known if this fox was responsible for the attack.It is thought there are some 35,000 urban foxes living in the UK, and some experts believe that as much as a third of that number live in the capital.  However, attacks on humans are very rare, generally occurring if the fox is trapped and is threatened.A United States Air Force F-22A Raptor fighter jet crashed in the Mojave Desert in the southwestern United States on Wednesday, according to officials.The airplane, which seats one person, crashed at approximately 10:30 am local time about 35 miles northeast of Edwards Air Force Base in California. The cause of the accident has not yet been ascertained, and the fate of the pilot is unknown. The jet was on a test mission when it crashed.The F-22 is a supersonic fifth-generation fighter jet. It was originally designed in the 1980s as a means of entering Soviet airspace and attacking Soviet bombers if they attempted a nuclear strike. After the Cold War ended, the jet was then used as a long-range fighter jet.This is the second crash involving an F-22.  In 2004, another Raptor crashed in a Nevada during a test mission.  The pilot managed to eject from the aircraft safely and did not sustain any injuries, although the aircraft was destroyed.The United States Air Force suspended non-mission critical F-15 flight operations on Nov. 3 following the crash of a Missouri Air National Guard F-15C aircraft Nov. 2. The F-15 will continue to fly in some emergency situations and a few others according to Air Force spokesperson John Elolf.The crash was 125 miles south of St. Louis on private property surrounded by the Mark Twain National Forest in Dent County, Missouri during dogfight training by four 131st Fighter Wing craft. The pilot ejected and suffered minor injuries.The cause of that accident is still under investigation, however, preliminary findings indicate that a possible structural failure of the aircraft may have occurred. The suspension of flight operations is a precautionary measure.The Air Force has stated that it will ensure that mission requirements will be met for worldwide operations normally accomplished by the F-15. Currently, F-15s operate out of bases in the continental United States, Alaska, England, Hawaii, Japan and the Middle East.The F-15 Eagle is an all-weather tactical fighter designed to permit the Air Force to gain and maintain air supremacy over the battlefield. There are more than 700 F-15s in the Air Force inventory. The F-15 reached initial operational capability for the Air Force in September 1975.File:FA-22 Raptor.jpgThe F-15C, D and E models were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm where they proved their superior combat capability. F-15C fighters accounted for 34 of the 37 Air Force air-to-air victories. The F-15E's were operated mainly at night, hunting SCUD missile launchers and artillery sites using the LANTIRN system.They have since been deployed for air expeditionary force deployments and Operations Southern Watch (the no-fly zone in Southern Iraq), Provide Comfort in Turkey, Allied Force in Bosnia, Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraqi Freedom in Iraq.The Air Force is replacing its aging F-15 fighters with the F-22 Raptor. The F-22 is an advanced stealth fighter aircraft combining stealth for in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. However, budgetary concerns have caused the Air Force to reduce their total order of F-22s.The United States Air Force is replacing emergency oxygen handles on its 170 F-22 Raptor jet fighters. The move follows a report into a November 2010 crash that killed a pilot in Alaska.The report finds Captain Jeffrey Haney's death was partly due to aircraft design flaws. The experienced 31-year-old was on a night mission when his aircraft crashed nose-down among mountains. Planemaker Lockheed Martin now faces legal action from his widow Anna, which they vow to contest.The report identified three separate problems with the ring handle to activate emergency oxygen. The first was that pulling the ring could require intense effort, the second that it was possible to drop the ring between seats, and the third that pilots in cold-weather gear could struggle to grasp it. Now new handles have been designed in Arizona and the Air Force will place them on all of the $143 million aircraft. All 40 Raptors at Haney's base, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage, have received the $47 upgrade. The Air Force bought 200 of them.Haney's death has been attributed by his employer as the result of his "channelized attention" on getting the main oxygen system to restart after it automatically cut out when it detected engine bay air leaks. This makes breathing through the jet's mask difficult. The Air Force say he should have activated his emergency oxygen but the accident report and lawsuit question his ability to do so. The report notes he was conscious and fighting to keep his jet airbourne up until impact.Documents filed with a court in Illinois claim the handle's position is "in an area impossible for a pilot to reach while he or she maneuvered the sophisticated aircraft at speeds exceeding the speed of sound and while he or she experienced forces many times the force of gravity."The fatal accident is not the only such problem to beset the F-22, which despite being billed by the Air Force as their most advanced fighter has never been deployed to combat since coming into service seven years ago. Three other Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson pilots activated emergency oxygen supplies during "physiological incidents" last month, said a spokesperson for the base. Raptors were grounded nationwide for five months last Summer over the oxygen systems.A US Airways Airbus A320, Flight 1549, has made an emergency landing in the Hudson River after a failed attempt to take off near Manhattan. There were 148 passengers and five crew on the flight to Charlotte from LaGuardia Airport. The plane took off at 3:26 PM EST (UTC-5) and went down minutes later. All aboard survived the landing.The United States Coast Guard has reported that they have sent units to the scene of the incident, and that a nearby ferry was giving life jackets to survivors. According to witnesses, the plane landed in the river, making a large splash in the water, at a somewhat gradual angle. "This looked like a controlled descent," said Bob Read, who witnessed the incident from his office.A source told The Wall Street Journal that the plane initially was maneuvering to make an emergency landing at nearby Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, but lost too much altitude and had to ditch in the river.Unconfirmed reports cite the pilot as saying that the plane encountered a flock of geese and that some of them went into both of the jet's engines, leading to a loss of powered flight. Passengers told the press that they heard a loud bang shortly after takeoff.A Federal Aviation Administration official said that the plane was airborne for only three minutes. For these rare water landings, pilots are trained to bring the plane down as they would on land, but with the landing gear still retracted.Salvage crews have dragged US Airways Flight 1549 out of the Hudson River in New York City. The Airbus A320 performed a successful emergency landing on water on Thursday after losing power shortly after departing La Guardia Airport.The aircraft was tied up at Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City for the last two days before the overnight lift. Efforts were complicated by strong currents and freezing temperatures, but the aircraft was successfully retrieved by a large crane from its Manhattan dock.The lift was completed slowly to allow the flooded cabin to drain as it was raised. The waterlogged cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have been removed and sent to Washington.When the plane was lifted, extensive damage to its underside was revealed. The aircraft's right engine remains attached and was retrieved with the aircraft, but the left separated. Sonar has located what is thought to be the engine on the riverbed.The jet was landed on the Hudson by Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who is credited with saving the 155 passengers and crew on board. He testified that it was almost certainly birds ingested on both engines that brought down the jet.The final report into the crash of a B-2 Spirit bomber belonging to the United States Air Force (USAF) in Guam has determined that the crash was caused by moisture on sensors which caused the jet to receive inaccurate data. It was the first loss of a B-2, which costs US$1.4 billion.The aircraft, belonging to USAF's 509th Air Wing and carrying the name Spirit of Kansas, was attempting takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base on February 23 this year when the crash occurred. Moisture in three of the 24 air pressure sensors caused the sensors, all on the port side, to feed back inaccurate data to the flight computer.The aircraft crew believed the bomber had reached the takeoff speed of 140 knots when in reality it was traveling ten knots slower and rotated for takeoff. The malfunction also meant that the sensors showed the plane to be in a nose down position, causing it to command a high level of pitch, around 30 degrees. This, combined with the low takeoff speed, caused the aircraft to stall and veer to the left.Major Ryan Link and Captain Justin Grieve, who were piloting, ejected as the left wingtip struck the ground. They were injured, with Grieve suffering compression fractures to his spine, but survived. The wreckage came to rest to the runway's left.The report also noted that more effective communications could have prevented the crash. The vulnerability of the sensors to moisture was first detected by aircrews and maintenance staff in 2006, at which time it was discovered that turning on the 500 degree pitot heat prior to sensor calibration would evaporate the water and cause a return to normal readings. However, this was never formally noted and so the pilots of the aircraft were unaware of the potential problem or its solution.They were also unaware that, at an earlier time at the same base, another B-2's takeoff roll was aborted at 70 knots due to abnormal indications. After inspection by maintenance personnel, it was determined that moisture in the sensor system was to blame. After turning on the pitot heat the aircraft took off without incident.Two pilots are uninjured after a United States B-2 Spirit stealth bomber crashed at Andersen Air Force Base, a U.S. airbase on Guam. No one on the ground was injured as a result of the crash either. According to a statement released by the U.S. Air Force, the two pilots from the 509th Bomb Wing were able to safely eject from the plane before it crashed into the ground at around 10:45 a.m. local time (00:45 GMT) and are said to be in good condition. Witnesses say a large plume of black smoke could be seen rising from the wreckage.It is not yet known what caused the crash, but an investigation is ongoing.The plane was making a visit to the island from Missouri's Whiteman Air Force Base which is home to all of the U.S.'s 21 B-2 bombers. Each plane costs about 1.2 to 2 billion U.S. dollars to build. Some of the bombers along with B-1B's are sometimes switched from Guam to the AFB in a routine rotation.A United States Air Force B-1 Lancer bomber aircraft caught fire after landing at an air base west of Doha, Qatar. The incident happened at Al Udeid Air Base at 1820 UTC on Friday. According to the Air Force, the fire has been contained and the flight crew safely evacuated from the aircraft.The B-1 Lancer can carry a variety of satellite and laser-guided bombs and is able to remain over targets for long periods of time to assist in close-air support for troops on the ground. It has been widely deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.In March, a B-1 slid off a runway at Anderson Air Force Base in Guam.On Friday, a group of hikers and 18 boy scouts were airlifted by helicopters away from a wildfire in Nephi Canyon, Utah. The hikers and scouts escaped into a rough rocky area to keep a safe distance from the dangerous wildfire after it advanced on their campground.The wildfire started in a campground in Salt Creek Canyon, 85 miles from Salt Lake City, and has burned 13,000 acres across 20 square miles as of Friday. The fire has burned a campground and motel, and forced the evacuation of all campgrounds and cabins in its path.Police from Frederick in Maryland, US have charged a homeless man with three offenses after a light aircraft was stolen from Frederick Municipal Airport early yesterday morning. The single-engine aircraft crashed as its thief tried to take off.51-year-old Calvin Cox was arrested near the scene in the nearby woods after officers arrived. He was discovered by dog handlers. The Piper Super Cub came off the runway and ran onto grass, sustaining damage to its fuselage and propeller as well as possibly its engine. The crash occured at 2:15 a.m.Cox has been charged with felony theft, burglary, and trespassing. The plane was removed from an airport hangar and belonged to the Mid-Atlantic Soaring Association, who uses it to tow gliders. Michael H. Higgins, the association's president, said it would be difficult for someone unfamiliar with the aircraft to start it, as several buttons and switches are required. He described the incident as "a very unusual situation." Police described Cox as familiar with aircraft. They say that while they have yet to determine any motive, they believe Cox's "intention was to leave the Frederick area." Nobody was injured in the crash.A United States Coast Guard crew rescued six Iranian seamen from a ship in distress yesterday. The cargo ship Ya-Hassan was rescued about 50NM (92.6km) off the coast of Umm Qasr, Iraq. The ship's engine room had flooded. This is the second time within a week that a United States crew has rescued Iranian citizens.According to the United States Navy, the Ya-Hassan signaled Coast Guard cutter Monomoy around 3 a.m. local time (0000 UTC) with signal flares and flashlights. Once rescued, the seamen were given water, blankets, and a meal prepared according to Islamic dietary laws.  One of the crew members was treated onboard the Monomoy for minor injuries.The rescued seamen were eventually given over to Iranian Coast Guard vessel Naji 7. The US Navy said the captain of the Naji 7 "thanks us for our cooperation."On January 5, a US Navy vessel escorting the USS John C. Stennis rescued 13 Iranian sailors who were being held by pirates. The United States, by its own account, often rescues ships in foreign waters, but has been publicizing the rescue of Iranian ships because of increased tensions between the United States and Iran.Shortly after 5:00 pm EDT on Monday, a northbound R6 SEPTA Regional Rail train collided with a northbound R5 train in the Center City section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The collision occurred underground past Philadelphia's Market East Station, near 9th and Vine Streets.  About 30 to 40 people on board the two trains suffered minor injuries, most of whom were riding in the front of the R6 train, however no serious or life-threatening injuries were reported.The R6 train, heading towards Norristown, Pennsylvania, departed Suburban Station at 4:44 pm, and arrived at Market East Station at 4:50 pm.  The R5 train, heading towards Doylestown, Pennsylvania, was running late and traveling right behind it was the R6.  Shortly after the R5 departed from Market East Station, the train deployed its air brakes in the tunnel, and then collided with the R6.  Although the collision occurred at only around 10 mph (16 km/h), the impact was great enough to toss passengers out of their seats.  One rider claimed, "All of the sudden, there was a real hard jerk, and the train just came to a complete stop. It felt like we hit something hard. But I was all right."After the collision, the R5 train was unloaded, and its 17 injured victims were taken to Jefferson University, Hahnemann University, and University of Pennsylvania hospitals.  After backing up to Market East Station to unload its passengers, the R6 later proceeded to the Temple University station to unload those who were injured, after officials realized it would be easier to unload at the above-ground station.  Police officers from the Philadelphia Police Department, SEPTA, and Temple University, rushed to the Temple University train station upon the train's arrival to help transport injured victims to the nearby Temple University Hospital. Firefighters and paramedics arrived at the station to assist the victims as well, transporting some of them off the train on stretchers.Uninjured passengers on the R6 train were transported by bus from Market East to Temple University, where they boarded an arriving R6 express train, which immediately switched to local service.  Following the collision, all trains passing through Market East Station were affected by delays of at least 20 minutes or more.  The out-of-service R6 train remained on one of the two outbound tracks at Temple University station, causing all incoming trains from Center City to queue behind one another on a single track, causing great delays for arriving trains at that station as well.Paramedics remained on the scene for two hours, and the accident scene was finally cleaned up by 7:00 pm EDT.  By 8:00 pm EDT, Regional Rail trains were running back on schedule after encountering delays of up to one hour.Authorities do not know the cause of the accident, however it is presumed to be a human error by one of the train's engineers.  According to a SEPTA official, "Trains are never under any circumstances supposed to be close enough to make contact so we take that very seriously and will be investigating that very seriously."  Investigations on the accident have begun by both local and federal officials, and the first meeting on this incident will be held by SEPTA on Wednesday.The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will make many of their marketable housing properties in the southeastern United States and elsewhere available to hurricane refugees.  HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson said that an "overwhelming" response from government and private officials would make housing available as soon as the middle of next week.  HUD housing centers as far away as Philadelphia and Detroit would be making properties available.  HUD is considering offering these properties to displaced persons regardless of their income and allowing the refugees to use the properties for up to one year.According to local officials, a United States drone attack in Pakistan's South Waziristan province has killed at least fifteen people, although some reports put the death toll as high as twenty. The incident occurred in the Shaktoi region of the province."Now the death toll is 15. It could rise further. People are still busy removing rubble," said a senior security official to the Reuters news agency. He commented that most of the dead were foreign fighters."The drones are apparently tracking and targeting Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud, whose presence is frequently reported in the area," said another official.The United States has increased attacks using drones since a suicide bomber killed seven US intelligence agents in eastern Afghanistan in late December of last year.According to the Associated Press, a United States Navy F-18 fighter jet has crashed into a house in a residential area in San Diego, California, near University City High School. The crash occurred around 12:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) as the plane was preparing for landing at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.Reports say that the pilot was able to eject from the plane before it crashed and is believed to have suffered only minor injuries. At least three people on the ground were killed, and one person is missing.Eye witness Joe Kreischer told the LA Times, "It was chugging along with what seemed like one engine. Then I heard a roar of engine and all of a sudden, woop, dead silence."Two houses burned down as a result of the crash.Authorities and military officials are investigating the cause of the crash.The four dead family members are known to have been Korean Methodists. Only the father Dong Yun Yoon was not in the house when it was destroyed.The United States Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has announced that inerting systems in airliner fuel tanks are to be made mandatory. The move, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), is in response to a recommendation made by the country's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of its investigation into a 1996 air disaster. TWA Flight 800 was a Boeing 747 that exploded in mid-air twelve years ago today, on July 17, 1996, above the Atlantic Ocean. All 230 people on board the New York to Paris flight were killed as the aircraft disintegrated shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport. It was ultimately determined that center wing fuel tank had exploded after sparking faulty wiring ignited a volatile fuel-air mix in the tank.After the investigation was completed the NTSB requested that the FAA enforce the requirement of inerting systems to prevent dangerous fuel-air mixes from being ignited. One of the most feasible ways of doing this is with nitrogen pumped into the tank, reducing the amount of oxygen available and making ignition difficult or impossible. The NTSB has a 'Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements' and inerting systems for airliners have been on the list since 2002.Since TWA 800 there have also been similar explosions in Thailand and India, but both occurred on the ground and resulted in no fatalities.The FAA's new directive requires all new aircraft from August 20 to have the equipment fitted. It also requires all carriers to retrofit their fleets, with half of their airliners to be compliant within six years and every jetliner in the US to have the technology fitted in nine years.The FAA's announcement was made at the Virginia hangar where the remains of Flight 800 are stored.Air carriers, who until now have fought against the changes, say that there will be a cost running into millions of dollars. If the nitrogen system is installed, the cost of retrofitting an airliner is at US$92,000 for mid-range jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, and costs $311,000 for a Boeing 777 or other similar long-range widebodied airliner. The 747, which has a large center wing fuel tank, is especially vulnerable to such explosions.The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  website (for requesting disaster aid) is only functional for applicants using the latest version of the Internet Explorer web browser on the Microsoft Windows operating system. Users with other web browsers, such as Netscape, Opera, Safari, Firefox, or operating systems other than Windows, are effectively screened out of the site, which gives them a message that they need to download Internet Explorer version 6 or call FEMA at 1-800-621-3362 to register. Relief workers are setting up many computer kiosks for evacuees to use. These kiosks are built from donated computers, many of which are unable to run Windows and/or Internet Explorer. Most of these kiosks use LiveCD versions of Linux, leaving evacuees unable to fill out aid forms. A spokesperson for FEMA told MSNBC they were aware of the problem, and were trying to resolve the issue. They were, however, unable to provide an estimate of when the problem would be solved. Mike Quealy, a FEMA spokesperson, said the issue occurred because this tool was originally designed for in-house use by people working at the call center.Telling the Opera web browser to spoof its user agent, by identifying itself as Internet Explorer, appears to trick the FEMA website into allowing the user to fill out the form. Firefox users can install the Prefbar extension (http://prefbar.mozdev.org/), and use the "User Agent Spoof" dropdown to achieve the same effect. Safari users can use the Debug drop-down menu (http://developer.apple.com/internet/safari/faq.html#anchor14), and use the "User Agent" option to achieve the same effect.   Other options are to run Windows and Internet Explorer in an emulator such as VirtualPC on the Mac or VMware on Linux. This option is slow and requires the user to already own or purchase a license for Windows and the emulator software. Purchasing the software can cost several hundred dollars. Implementing a software compatibility layer, like the GPL wine project, allows the user to run certain Windows software on Linux, but still requires valid licenses for Windows.The United States government has filed a civil lawsuit against BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. (BPXA) alleging that the company "violated federal clean air and water laws" by "illegally discharging" more than 200,000 gallons crude oil during two oil spills in 2006 on Alaska's North Slope in Prudhoe Bay.BPXA previously pleaded guilty to one count of criminal negligence in illegally discharging the oil and paid US$20 million in damages. As a result of the plea, the lawsuit was filed saying that they "failed" to prepare for such a disaster by implementing "certain [sic] spill prevention measures" as the law requires.The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the [DOT]-Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), alleges that BPXA "illegally discharged more than 200,000 gallons of crude oil from its pipelines" and "violated the Clean Air Act by improperly removing asbestos-containing materials from its pipelines" It also says that they "failed to comply in a timely manner with a corrective action order that the [DOT]-Pipeline and PHMSA issued to BPXA pursuant to federal pipeline safety laws."According to the Associated Press (AP), BPXA spokespeople state that the company has taken certain measures, making sure daily operations are safe."We have taken significant steps to ensure that our operations are safe and reliable, and protect the environment. Those include building a new $500 million system of oil transit lines at Prudhoe Bay," said spokesman Steve Rinehart to the AP.The spills were discovered on March 2, 2006 and covered nearly two acres. It was initially estimated that nearly 270,000 gallons had spilled. The official loss was put at 212,252 gallons.BPXA, a subsidiary of BP America, specializes in exploring and finding locations to drill for oil, as well as drilling for it.The US military has halted the evacuation of victims of the Haiti earthquake for medical care, reportedly due to uncertainty about who will pay for the costs.A military official told the New York Times that flights to the US were stopped on Wednesday, as some hospitals didn't want to receive the refugees."Apparently, some states were unwilling to accept the entry of Haitian patients for follow-on critical care. We manage air evacuation missions, but without a destination to fly to we can't move anybody. If we don't have permission to bring them, or they won't take them in, we can't fly the mission. It's pretty simple," US Transportation Command spokesman Capt Kevin Aandahl said yesterday. He did not say, however, which states specifically refused more evacuees.The New York Times reports that five hundred victims of the quake have been treated in Florida so far. A spokesman for Floridian governor Charlie Crist, however, commented that he wasn't aware of any hospitals in the state refusing to accept more evacuees. In a letter to US Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius earlier this week, however, the governor commented that "Florida's healthcare system is quickly reaching saturation, especially in the area of high-level trauma care," and asked for the National Disaster Medical System to be activated. That system is primarily used to help fund victims of domestic disasters.A doctor in the earthquake-ravaged country, however, remarked that many of his patients could die if not airlifted soon. "We have 100 critically ill patients who will die in the next day or two if we don't med-evac them," said Doctor Green, chairman for the University of Miami's Global Institute for Community Health and Development, to the Associated Press.An earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.0, struck Haiti on January 12, killing as much as 200,000 people and largely destroying the capital Port-au-Prince; another million have been left without homes.The United States government will resume evacuation flights for injured Haitians following doctors advising that many were likely to die if they did not receive immediate medical care. Airlifts stopped Wednesday due to logistical issues. Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said on Sunday that airlifts should resume within the next twelve hours.Vietor said Haitians with spinal injuries and burns were flown to the U.S., most for treatment in Florida. The state's governor, Charlie Crist, advised the Obama administration last week that Florida's healthcare system was be called on to deal with a considerable number of injured from Haiti; that victims had high-trauma injuries, only increasing the strain on the healthcare system available in Florida. Crist requested the Federal Government activate the National Disaster Medical System, which often provides the necessary funds for disaster victims.The World Food Programme (WFP) also began delivering food to Haitian women on Sunday. A spokesperson stated that they had decided to only release food to the women in an effort to reduce violence caused by the starvation dilemma. Rice was distributed in sixteen locations across Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. The WFP gave 25kg (or 55 pounds) of rice to each woman, enough rice to feed an average family in Haiti for two weeks.An Amtrak passenger train de-railed after hitting a pickup truck in Plant City, Florida, in the United States. The driver of the pickup truck was killed on impact. The crash occurred at a marked railroad crossing inside of an industrial area, according to an Amtrak spokesperson.None of the 133 passengers were seriously hurt, however, the train's engineer and five passengers were taken to a local hospital after suffering minor injuries. The remaining passengers were taken to a local bowling alley. Although the train's two locomotives and nine cars de-railed, they remained upright. Witnesses report the train sounded its horns at the appropriate times. It was reported the pickup truck simply drove in front of the train.The crash is the second to occur this week with a train; on Monday, a driver in a Pontiac Grand Am deliberately ignored the lights and crossing arms at another railroad crossing in the area, and drove around them, into the path of a different Amtrak train on the same route. The impact caused the car to go airborne. All four people in the car were killed; no one on the train was injured.Investigators with the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are looking into a serious runway incursion at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina. A regional jet came within ten feet of striking a private turboprop.The incident occured on May 29. A Bombardier CRJ-200 owned by US Airways subsidiary PSA Airlines was cleared to take off.  As the jet moved off down the runway a Pilatus PC-12 was cleared to move onto the same runway and await permission to begin its own takeoff.As the jet headed towards the other aircraft a monitoring system called ASDE-X alerted air traffic control that the aircraft was on a collision course. The controllers immediately informed the PSA jet. As the aircraft approached the PC-12 the turboprop's pilot also realised the danger and moved his aircraft to one side of the runway.The jet was able to come to a stop just ten feet from the other plane. The CRJ-200 had 42 passengers and three crew on board, and it is unclear how many people were on the PC-12.Officials with the US Marine Corps have announced their investigation into the fatal crash of a Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey transport plane on April 11 has found pilot error was to blame. The probe found two marines died after the pilots lost control in a tailwind in Morocco.The accident has triggered attention from Japanese media ahead of a planned deployment there, and officials at a press conference Friday were keen to stress no mechanical or structural defects were found. The pilots had opted for an unplanned 180-degree turn to avoid flying low over obstructions including people and vehicles. This move placed them into a strong tailwind.This wind tilted the plane forward, but the pilots did not realise and began rolling the engines forward. The Osprey had been flying in helicopter mode, with the rotors pointed skywards; by pointing them forwards, it can be operated as a standard aircraft. Normal flight rules call for the aircraft being level, not tilted, when this switch is made.These actions moved the center of gravity forward, which pitched the nose further down. Pulling on the flight column was insufficient to correct the problem, and the aircraft flew down into the ground. Two Marines in the back were killed, and both pilots were seriously injured. The investigation suggested leaving the aircraft in helicopter mode could have prevented the accident.The wounded pilots are still recovering, and Marine Corps Aviation's deputy commandant Lt. Gen. Robert Schmidle said that when they are well enough they will go before a panel to determine if they are fit to fly. He says their actions will be scrutinised then. Schmidle also said the model's flight manual will be updated and training given to pilots in light of the crash."It's an extraordinarily complex set of circumstances that caused this to happen", he told reporters Friday. He called the plane a "solid, safe" model.An amphibious vehicle belonging to the United States Marines capsized and sank to the floor of the Del Mar boat basin, California at 1130 PST (1930 UTC) resulting in one death and three injures.Three instructors and three students were conducting driver training when the vehicle capsized and sank, trapping them inside. Three injured individuals were transported to hospital and two were uninjured. The deceased Marine was rescued at around 1415 PST and was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1447 PST. Oxygen was being pumped into the vehicle for hours in an attempt to keep the Marine alive.Captain Daniel J. Thomas revealed that "There will be a thorough investigation into this mishap that occurred." He continued, "[there will be] reports that come, lessons learned in terms of preventing anything like this from happening." Major Thomas said that training would not be stopped, but "We’re going to take a look at this and the commander will then make a decision before anything goes back into place to make sure any safety briefing that need to be given are conducted."The identity of the dead Marine has not yet been revealed; the family have yet to have been notified.In the Midwestern United States, floodwaters contaminated with a toxic brew containing such ingredients as sewage, farm runoff, and petroleum are raising concerns over the availability of clean drinking water. Flooding has been reported in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kansas and Indiana, with three deaths reported each in Iowa and Indiana, prompting comparisons to similar floods in 1993 that caused US$21 billion in damages. The flooding in Iowa has resulted in damage to buildings, infrastructure and farms, and governor Chet Culver's office has estimated that 36,000 people have been made homeless.Residents of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who had begun returning to their homes to inspect damage and salvage belongings, wade through ankle-deep water that has picked up refuse from farms, sewage, and other noxious chemicals. LeRoy Rippert, chairman of emergency management and homeland security in Des Moines County, was concerned for residents, saying "It is very, very wise to stay out of it. It's as dangerous as anything". Experts in biology and medicine also raised concerns over the floodwater contaminating rural wells and providing breeding grounds for mosquitos. "For rural folks, it's going to be hard to know if their water's safe or not," said G. Richard Olds, chairman of the Medical College of Wisconsin. Ken Sharp, environmental health director for the Iowa Department of Public Health, acknowledged the risks of the contaminated water, but suggested that the sheer volume of water may help to dilute the pollution.June has seen a number of disasters hit the Midwest, including a tornado that killed four Boy Scouts last week.The United States military has confirmed that three of the six crew on board a B-52 Stratofortress that crashed near Guam's Apra Harbour yesterday are dead. The strategic bomber belonged to the US Air Force (USAF).The aircraft had been headed for a Liberation Day celebration to perform a flyover when it crashed thirty miles off the coast. Since the Monday morning accident 3,000 square miles of ocean have been searched, with aircraft drafted in from as far afield as Japan to help.The commander of the 35th wing in Guam told reporters that since the crash at 9:45 am local time "we've had no encouraging indicators that our airmen survived this crash." He also said that amongst the groups searching were the US Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and Drug Enforcement Agency in addition to Guam Fire and Rescue and Police Departments.According to the navy, there were no munitions or weapons on board at the time of the crash.The United States military has said that a MH-53 Pave Low military helicopter carrying seven soldiers crashed during a routine training mission in Florida near Eglin Air Force Base late Friday night.At least two of the soldiers suffered non-life threatening injuries, while the other five were unhurt and are being kept in the hospital for further evaluation. No civilians were injured and no damage was caused to civilian property.The cause of the crash is not known and the military states that the crash is under investigation."A board of officers will investigate the accident. As soon as additional details become available, they will be provided," said a statement posted on the website for Eglin AFB.The soldiers were with the 20th Special Operations Squadron from Hurlburt Field in Florida.The United States military Strategic Command (STRATCOM) has said that the 'fireballs' spotted over areas of Texas in the United States on Sunday February 15, are not related to the collision of a U.S. and Russian satellite in space. According to spaceweather.com, NASA says the object was a meteor."There is no correlation between the debris from that collision and those reports of re-entry," said STRATCOM military spokeswoman Major Maj. Regina."It's a natural meteor, definitely," said Bill Cooke, an astronomer at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. On Tuesday, February 10, the American civilian communications satellite Iridium 33, launched in 1997, and the defunct Russian military communications satellite Kosmos-2251, launched in 1993, collided over Siberia. On Friday February 13, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an alert for falling debris from the satellites, following reports of "explosions and earthquakes" along with "flashes in the sky" in Jackson and Louisville, Kentucky.Then again on Sunday, calls to 9-1-1 began to come in to Williamson County, Texas sheriff's office around 12:30 p.m. (Central time) that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of Austin, Houston, Waco and San Antonio."The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris. These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in vibrations felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky," said the NOAA on Friday in an public information alert posted on their website. The FAA says the burning material over Texas is not related to this alert."We don't know what it was [over Texas]," said Roland Herwig, a spokesman for the FAA on Monday. The alerts still remain in effect in Kentucky until further notice.Residents in Texas reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions on Sunday morning. After a search of several areas, the Williamson county sheriff's office reported that no debris or impact sites were found. Earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding. There was previous speculation was that the object in Texas could have been a meteor. Doctor Marco Ciocca, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University told WKYT on Sunday that it's too early for the debris from the satellites to be reentering the planet's atmosphere. "[It could] be months" before any of the satellite wreckage enters the earth's atmosphere. "The debris doesn't simply fall out of its orbit. It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into earth's atmosphere."However, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) said on February 12 that the debris could have taken 10 days or less to reenter over portions of the planet. "Within 24 hours of the collision, the U.S. space tracking system had identified 600 pieces of debris. This large number suggests that the collision must have been relatively head-on. If the two satellites hit head-on, rather than a glancing blow, the energy of the collision would completely disintegrate both satellites into clouds of debris," said the UCS in a statement on their website who also added that the collision took place in "the same region of space where China destroyed a defunct Chinese weather satellite with an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon" in 2007. "That January 2007 test created a massive amount of debris." There have been at least eight major satellite collisions since 1991. The satellites, both of which had a mass in excess of 450 kilograms, and were traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour (28,150 km/hour), collided 491 miles (790 km) above the earth. Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive. They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the earth will be affected. STRATCOM continues to track the debris. The results of a plotting analysis will be posted to a public website.The US Navy Fifth Fleet said in a statement that the aircraft, an  E-2C Hawkeye surveillance plane, had crashed into the ocean after experiencing "mechanical malfunctions," in what the statement termed a "mishap." The incident reportedly occurred at around 1400 local time (1000 UTC). The aircraft and crew had been stationed on the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), and were "returning from conducting operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom."The aircraft was carrying four crew at the time of the incident, of which three have been rescued.  A search for the remaining crew member is currently under way.  Pending notification of next-of-kin, the military has not released the identities of the personnel involved. An investigation has also been opened into the incident.The type of aircraft involved. E-2C Hawkeye, was designed to provide an effective airborne early-warning system, as well as conducting surveillance missions, co-ordinating combat operations and running search and rescue missions.  The plane that crashed was used for missions around the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, including command and control operations, as well as longer-range surveillance missions, such as the one it was returning from when it crashed.The USS San Francisco ran aground, or hit bottom, while underwater approximately 350 miles (563 kilometers) south of the South Pacific island of Guam today at about noon local time (2 a.m. UTC).It is unknown the full extent of the damage and injuries, but at least one person has died and several lesser injuries are known. The submarine is on the surface now and is on its way to a port in Guam.The Los Angeles class submarine had no reports of damage to the reactor plant, which is operating normally.Military and Coast Guard aircraft are enroute to monitor and assist in the situation.The USS Guardian, a United States Navy vessel used for destroying mines, ran aground in the Philippines' Tubbataha Reef National Park in the Sulu Sea on Thursday, according to the US Navy.The US Navy said the incident occurred at 2:25 a.m. local time about 130 km east-southeast of the province of Palawan in the Philippines and about 98 nautical miles from Puerto Princesa, the capital of the province. There were no reports of injuries nor signs of fuel leakage. The ship has a crew of 80 and had previously completed a port call at Subic Bay earlier in the week. The US Navy also said they were investigating the incident. They also said in a statement, "The crew is currently working to determine the best method of safely extracting the ship". An Avenger class mine countermeasures ship, the ship was on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan. It is assigned to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet and based in Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan.The US Embassy in Manila stated, "The Government of the Philippines was promptly informed of the incident and offered to assist the U.S. Navy, and we greatly appreciate their offers of assistance [...] The safety of the Guardian’s crew and preventing harm to the environment are the U.S. Navy's top priorities". An official of the Armed Forces of the Philippines based in Palawan told reporters they have deployed a force offering to assist the Guardian.Under sections 19 and 26 of the Tubbataha Reefs National Park Act of 2009, Republic Act 10067, the US Navy can be charged with unauthorized entry and could pay 12,000PHP for each square meter of reef destroyed.A similar incident occurred in 2005 when the Rainbow Warrior ran aground in the same vicinity. Greenpeace, an environmental advocacy group and owners of the Rainbow Warrior, were fined 384,000PHP (US$6,857) for damaging a reef area of 32 by 3 meters (105 by 10 feet).Tubbataha Reef has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993 and covers 97,030 hectares. A diverse variety of coral reef and marine life currently take refuge within the park including sharks and turtles. The reef is also known as a popular recreational diving site.US president Barack Obama has endorsed permitting a mosque to be built a few blocks away from the site where Al Qaeda terrorists intentionally crashed two planes into the World Trade Center towers in 2001, otherwise known as 'Ground Zero'. The site is located in New York City.Obama, who stated his endorsement at an annual dinner celebrating the Islamic holiday of Ramadan, said, "As a citizen, and as president, I believe that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances. This is America, and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakable."Reaction to the presidential endorsement was mixed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, a staunch supporter of building the Cordoba House Islamic Center, has said that Obama's comments were a "clarion defense of the freedom of religion." However, many Republicans were angry, including US Representative Peter King, Republican-New York, who said that "President Obama is wrong." Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer stated that "the governor of New York offered to help find land to build the mosque elsewhere. A mosque really seeking to build bridges ... would accept the offer." Other right-wing politicians, including Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, have opposed the mosque, calling the World Trade Center site "hallowed ground."US president Barack Obama visited the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Thursday, 161 km (100 mi) away from White House, to honor 18 soldiers who died in Afghanistan due to varying reasons. The bodies of the dead were brought by C-17 air craft.Obama left the White House around 00:19 local time (-7 UTC) by helicopter and reached the base where the C-17 air plane brought the bodies of the dead. Obama stood silent and motionless near the air plane while the bodies were brought down and were wrapped with the American flag.Ten of those soldiers, including three drug enforcement agents, died when their plane crashed in Western Afghanistan, and four others when their plane crashed in Southern Afghanistan. The other eight soldiers were killed in roadside bomb attacks in the Kandahar province.Obama himself met their families and then returned back to White House at around 04:45. The whole ceremony was unannounced and unexpected.The United States Senate has cut short their summer recess and has arrived in Washington to approve a $10.5 billion aid bill to victims of Katrina as requested by President George W. Bush.The United States House of Representatives is expected to pass a similar bill later today.Bush has told Congress he will ask for more funds in the coming weeks.  Most of the money will go to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the rest will go to the Pentagon which is dispatching ships to the area.Bush has also asked his father, former President George H.W. Bush and former President Bill Clinton to help raise private funds for relief like they did for the December 2004 tsunami in Asia.Over two dozen nations, some with assets in the area, have offered aid to the city of New Orleans, but President George W. Bush has refused any aid from foreign nations which does not take the form of cash.Sonia Sotomayor, the U.S. Supreme Court nominee, fractured her right ankle after stumbling on her way to be seated aboard her airplane to Washington, D.C. at Laguardia Airport on Monday.She was sent to a local medical office, where an X-ray was taken. Sotomayor was later released.She has a cast wrapped around her ankle, which has been signed by a senator. Sotomayor's cast will be replaced after 3 weeks. She has been limping on her bad ankle, but otherwise seems to be okay."She flew to D.C. I think it was looked at when she got here, and she was advised to go get X-rays, which she did. I think she spent a couple of hours getting the cast, and the last time I saw video, (she was) up on Capitol Hill continuing to meet with senators as part of her meetings surrounding her nomination," said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs.A United States swimmer, Fran Crippen, drowned during an open-water race today in the United Arab Emirates.  The cause of the drowning is unknown.  However, Crippen told his coach that he was feeling ill eight kilometers (km) into the ten km race.The Philadelphian, who comes from a line of prominent swimmers, was participating in the FINA Open Water ten kilometer World Cup in Fujairah, Dubai. When Crippen did not finish the race, swimmers were the first to respond by returning to the water to search for him. Soon after the dive team arrived and found his body just before the last buoy of the two km triangular race course according to race officials.He was taken to the Fujairah Hospital where he was pronounced dead. FINA President Julio Maglione said that Crippen told his coach that he was not feeling well eight km into the race. Speaking from Mexico, where he was attending Olympic meetings, Maglione added, "He continued and he was found in the deep of the water." Maglione disclosed that this was the first death in a FINA event and that they had launched an investigation into the death.The Crippen family is no stranger to the swimming world with Maddy Crippen competing in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Terry Crippen on the US national team and Claire Crippen a former Virginia NCAA All-American. All was under strict rules that exist in our competition. All was absolutely correct. It was an accident, a terrible accident. – Julio MaglioneAn unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) belonging to the US military has crashed in the northern Iraq city of Mosul. The Shadow drone struck the roof of the Islamic Party's office.The UAV then bounced down into the building's yard, and is not thought to have been shot down. No injuries were reported and Major Derrick Cheng says the location of the crash is a pure coincidence.Party member Yahya Abid Mahjob said the party was requesting that the military take greater care with their UAVs. The Shadow, which is an unarmed reconnaissance plane, has been retrieved by US forces.Earlier this month, another US UAV crashed in central Iraq. The Predator came down without causing damage or injuries. It is a larger vehicle capable of firing Hellfire missiles.A California wildfire has reached Interstate 5, just 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.The fire has burned 400 acres of grassland in the Angeles National Forest, and continues to blaze in the Pyramid Lake area.According to the forest spokeswoman Dee Dechert, the fire is 50 percent contained, but it has damaged Southern California Edison power lines, causing traffic jams. The two right northbound lanes on Interstate 5 had to be shut down, backing up traffic for several miles; they were still closed Tuesday morning. However, no homes or other structures are at risk.As of 7 pm local time on Tuesday, 500 people, mostly from Los Angeles County Fire Department, were working to contain the fire in heat that exceeded 100 ℉ (38 ℃). According to authorities, four helicopters and six air tankers were also on the scene to control the flames, which are being pushed northeast by a 5 miles (8 km) per hour wind.The wildfire began around noon on Monday, just northwest of Castaic near the Golden State Freeway. The cause is not currently known, but it is expected to be 100 percent contained by 6 pm on Tuesday.The only injury reported so far occurred when a firefighter was stung by a bee.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the United States and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) in the United Kingdom are working together 'closely' after a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 in the US suffered an engine power incident. The event has similarities to the crash of British Airways Flight 38 in January at London's Heathrow Airport.The AAIB and the NTSB are now collaborating to try and determine whether or not the two events are in fact linked. On November 26 a Delta 777-200ER cruising at 39,000 feet near Great Falls suffered a serious reduction in power on the right-hand (number 2) engine without input from either the flight crew or the aircraft's control systems. The pilots lowered the jetliner to 31,000 feet in accordance with procedures in the flight manuals and regained full power in the engine.From that point on, the engine behaved normally again. The flight, Flight 18 from Shanghai, continued to its destination of Atlanta.Investigators have noticed similarities to the January crash of a British Airways jet in London. Flight 38, another 777, suffered this same uncommanded loss of engine thrust in both engines during final approach to Heathrow on January 17, and crashed short of the runway. There were no fatalities, although several passengers were injured. The aircraft was written off.An interim report by the AAIB, which is leading the investigation into the crash of Flight 38, has suggested that an ice buildup during the trip from China in the fuel supply caused the accident. As a result, Boeing recommended pilots of such aircraft occasionally rev up their engines on lengthy flights to stop ice from building up.Both airliners were equipped with twin Rolls-Royce Trent 895 engines. The NTSB appointed Senior Air Safety Investigator Bill English as the accredited representative of the US to the AAIB on the London crash. Now, he has also been put in charge of the NTSB investigation into the Delta midair incident. The two investigative bodies are now working with each other to try to identify whether there are common circumstances behind both events.Among the parties to the investigation are Eaton-Argotech. The firm manufactures fuel systems for commercial airliners, amongst other users. Also participating are the US Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing, Delta, and the Air Line Pilots Association.Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States have issued an 'urgent safety recommendation' in connection to their role alongside the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch in investigating loss of power in Rolls-Royce engines on Boeing 777s, with the AAIB following suit. One of them resulted in British Airways Flight 38 crashing short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport last year. The NTSB and the AAIB want Rolls-Royce to redesign the engines.Both events occurred on Boeing 777-200ER airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800 Series engines. On January 17, 2008 British Airways Flight 38 experienced a dual engine rollback (reduction of engine power) on final approach to Heathrow and crashed, leaving one passenger seriously injured, eight passengers and four of the flight crew with minor injuries and the airplane written off.The second event occurred on November 26, 2008, when a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 experienced a single engine rollback during cruise flight over Montana, United States while en route from Shanghai to Atlanta. Normal operations resumed after the flight crew followed Boeing's published procedure to recover engine performance and the airplane landed safely in Atlanta.Boeing has already developed new procedures after the crash to prevent ice from building up within their 777 fuel systems after it became apparent that icing may have been a factor, and it was some of these that the Delta flight crew had followed. Boeing modified these further after the Delta incident. As part of the recent releases by the NTSB and AAIB it has become apparent that investigators from both bodies, which are collaborating, have found ice buildup in the fuel system caused both rollbacks.In both cases a build-up of ice (from water normally present in all jet fuel) developed on a component called the fuel/oil heat exchanger. This restricted the flow of fuel to the engine, resulting in the uncommanded engine rollback. Investigators initially struggled to produce enough ice under test conditions but have now found that at high concentration, fuel can form ice at very low temperatures in enough quantity to seriously restrict fuel flow, according to a new interim report by the AAIB. This does not occur when fuel demand is lower, as the hot oil then becomes sufficient to entirely melt the ice. The British jet experienced very low temperatures over Siberia. The vigorous tests are thought to be the first of their kind. They have also confirmed that while ice may have formed elsewhere in the airliner's fuel system fuel was probably not restricted at any other location. Instead, it is thought 'soft' ice formed in the pipes and then broke off, travelling to the fuel/oil heat exchanger and restricting it.The NTSB has now revealed that they have advised Rolls-Royce to redesign the fuel/oil heat exchanger, and Rolls-Royce have stated that they are indeed working on a replacement part that will be available within twelve months. The AAIB advised Boeing and Rolls-Royce to jointly review the problem across the fuel system, and both companies responded that they 'accepted' this recommendation and repeated that a replacement part was being developed.Both the NTSB and the AAIB also sent letters to the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency requesting the installment of the modified component be mandatory. The NTSB suggested this should be either the next maintenance check or within six months. There are 220 Boeing 777-200s - the only type using the affected engine - with Trent 800 series engines.The fuel/oil heat exchanger is a dual purpose part designed to simultaneously melt fuel ice and cool down engine oil.The AAIB further noted that it is unclear weather other aircraft designs are at risk, and advised the FAA and EASA to look into increased use of de-icing additives and investigate both the accumulation and sudden movement of ice in aircraft fuel systems and the actual formation of ice in the fuel itself.Today rescue workers will drill a sixth hole into the collapsed Utah mine in a final effort to resuce the trapped miners who have been missing since August 6.The previous holes, which have been dug as deep as 1,500 feet (460 m) underground at the Crandall Canyon Mine, have not produced any signs of the trapped miners.Bob Murray, the mine's co-owner, said this sixth attempt to reach the miners will be the last. Murray also said that this last attempt will bring him closure. However, he realizes the families may never find the closure they are calling for. A spokesman for the families said they do not want the rescue efforts to stop until they find the men. One family member said, "He doesn't realize that what we have now is hope, and maybe our family members are not alive, but we want our bodies out...We want proper burials."Mining will not be resumed in the area, Murray said.Rob Moore, the vice president of mine operator Murray Energy, said today, "It's likely that these miners may not be found." A fourth hole was drilled into the Utah mine yesterday, but there are still no signs of the six trapped miners who have been missing for two weeks. A top executive of the company that co-owns the Crandall Canyon Mine said that the latest results from the fourth hole that was drilled more than 1,500 feet down into the mountainside found that the air quality could not sustain life. Crews performed yet another sound test, but no signals were heard.However, rescuers refuse to give up, now working on a fifth hole.Underground tunneling has been stopped after a mountain "bump" killed three rescuers and injured six others on Thursday.An arms depot in Uzbekistan has experienced a series of explosions today after a fire at a military base near the city of Kagan, killing at least three people. The base dates back to Soviet times.The fire broke out late Wednesday. Although information about the accident comes from officials, one official at Uzbekistan's Emergency Situations Ministry denied the report. Local media did not report the fire for at least twelve hours after it ignited, and one local resident who spoke with the Associated Press refused to be identified for fear of retribution by the authorities. The resident was quoted as saying, "we were woken up in the middle of the night and everybody came out onto the street."Independent Russian website Ferghana.ru reports that around 20 houses, a hospital, a railway station and a helicopter base have been destroyed, and 21 people have been injured by the blasts. The biggest explosions blew out windows in Bukhara, which is 7 miles away.The military has stopped people returning for their belongings and has placed them in schools for now. The evacuations were conducted by soldiers who are also working to quell the flames.It is thought that the fire started in the helicopter base and, despite efforts by soldiers, it then spread to the supplies of shells. The risk of more blasts is hampering investigatory efforts, but it is reported by a local official that the fire has been extinguished."I was working on my laptop when I heard a massive explosion which broke the windows. Then the sky lit up like at dawn," said one resident. The explosions started three hours after the fire initially broke out.Kagan has a population of 50,000 and is an important part of the local rail network. The town's phone lines have become inoperative due to the blasts, and rail services from the capital, Tashkent, have been canceled. The military currently has the town sealed off.Defense Minister Ruslan Mirzayev traveled to the site. The base was used to store unused munitions after the Soviet-Afghan War.File:Gran incendio de Valparaíso de 2014.jpgAt least twelve people have been killed, and over ten thousand evacuated from the Chilean city of Valparaíso, following an ongoing fire sweeping across parts of the city.The fire, which began on Saturday in woods on one of Valparaíso's hills, has razed at least five hundred houses. 1,200 fire personnel are tackling the blaze, whilst members of the Chilean Navy have been deployed to discourage looting. Many residences of the affected area have no water supply, and are joined by narrow winding streets; yesterday firefighters dropped water on the flames from seventeen aircraft.Chilean president Michelle Bachelet declared an emergency,  with the army coordinating the evacuation. She called the blaze a "tremendous tragedy", noting, "In some places the fires have started again so we're working on this and people will continue to be protected".One resident told the Reuters news agency, "[w]e fled from the La Cruz neighborhood, from an apartment I just got not too long ago. It’s all burned down, my sister’s house also burnt to the ground".Shelters have been erected to house the thousands fleeing the inferno, and hospitals have been treating hundreds for smoke inhalation. Much of the city is without power.The inflatable roof covering BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia was intentionally collapsed in a "controlled deflation" on Friday after a section of the dome was ripped open. As the seven-metre tear became caught in the wind, it began to make loud noises, which one stadium worker described as similar to "elephants running through your living room". The venue was evacuated and no one was reported injured. Windy weather conditions are blamed for the damage. Officials have not yet indicated when roof repairs can be completed to allow the facility to re-open.BC Place Stadium was opened in June 1983 and is scheduled as a key venue for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The roof costs $300,000 per year to maintain.Severe rainfall on the 16th of November has led to a water quality warning affecting more than two million people living in the Greater Vancouver metropolitan region. Wednesday's storm triggered severe landslides in the region's three water reservoirs, creating sediment levels up to ninety times higher than permitted under federal health standards. The Vancouver Coastal Health Authority issued a warning to residents advising them to boil all water intended for personal consumption. The advisory is mandatory for hospitals, daycares, and other public facilities, and is in effect until further notice. The region's Chief Medical Health Officer has advised that tap water not be used for anything. "We know that with turbidity levels this high there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal illness. So people need to be aware of that, although it's their choice," warned Dr. Patricia Daly. "If I'm asked, I'm telling the public: Don't drink the water from the tap at this time. Drink bottled water or boil your water for a full minute." Commercial operations were affected as well. Food stores were ordered to turn off produce sprayers used to cool vegetables, and restaurants had to stop serving many food products. Many of Vancouver's hundreds of coffee shops were quiet.The Greater Vancouver area has received a total of 236.8mm of rain this month. The rainfall record of 350.8mm was set in 1983, according to measurements taken at Vancouver International Airport. BC Hydro, the province's primary electrical provider, was busy repairing power and telephone lines blown down in the heavy winds. Over 220,000 customers were left without electricity in the aftermath of the storm, with more rain expected on Sunday.Vanuatu has been hit by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake at 04:14 local time on Friday (17:14 UTC on Thursday). The epicenter was located 215 kilometers to the northwest of Luganville, Espíritu Santo, Vanuatu; 340 kilometers to the southeast of Lata, Santa Cruz Islands, Solomon Islands; 485 kilometers to the northwest of Port-Vila, Vanuatu; and 2,070 kilometers to the northeast of Brisbane, Australia.The earthquake had a depth of 36.1 kilometers, approximately 22.4 miles. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii issued a tsunami warning for Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and New Caledonia. They said on the report: "It is not known that a tsunami was generated. This warning is based only on the earthquake evaluation. An earthquake of this size has the potential to generate a destructive tsunami that can strike coastlines in the region near the epicenter within minutes to hours." The Vanuatu government Meteorological Office reported infrastructure cracks, and power outages, but does not foresee major damage. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, CNN reported. USGS initially reported the earthquake as 7.6, but they later downgraded it. Magnitude 5.7, 5.2 and 6.4 aftershocks were reported later by USGS.The tsunami warning was cancelled an hour after it was issued. Geophysicist Barry Hershorn said to The Huffington Post that they had confirmed there was no tsunami from ocean buoys and from coastal sea level gauges in Vanuatu. The Vanuatu goverment said they were pleased the tsunami alert had been canceled. "We haven't received any reports yet about earthquake damage," said Salesa Kaniaha, Meteorological Office acting director of Vanuatu. "The very close proximity [of the epicenter] to Espíritu Santo [the closest island] meant there was nothing much we could do to alert residents to any danger," he added.Vanuatu is an insular country located in southern Pacific Ocean, located 1,750 kilometers to the east of Australia.Ten passengers on board a British Airways jet that crashed in London's Heathrow Airport are suing the manufacturer of the aircraft. Documents filed before a court in Chicago, Illinois claim that Boeing were responsible for design flaws with the fuel system.The Boeing 777 crash-landed early in 2008 after engine power was lost on final approach, coming down short of the runway.  The aircraft was severely damaged.  The United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch is still investigating, but interim reports have indicated that engine components became clogged with ice developing in the fuel.The crew of the aircraft were praised for their handling of the emergency, avoiding the perimeter fence and nearby houses. None of the 136 passengers and 16 crew were killed but some of those suffered serious injuries, including broken bones and facial injuries. Some were left unable to fly and there were cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.The case, run by London firm Stewarts Law, is that Boeing are liable for the design of the engine component upon which the ice settled during the accident. "Our clients are not critical of BA and feel that the pilots performed heroically in guiding the aircraft down in exceptionally difficult circumstances," said the partner in charge of the case, Stuart Dench. "However the two interim reports from the Air Accident Investigation Branch suggest design defects in the aircraft's fuel system and in particular its limitations in the prevention of dangerous ice build-up. The passengers we represent are therefore prepared to take on Boeing in its home court in Chicago, which is undoubtedly the most appropriate jurisdiction for this case."Boeing may seek to have the case heard in London before the High Court. If successful, the claimants are estimated by the media to be able to claim US$1 million (£600,000).Large parts of Victoria were hit with power outages after bushfires near Benalla knocked out power transmission lines connecting the state to the national electricity grid at approximately 4:00 p.m. local time. Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo were all affected. Paul Price from the national electricity grid supervisor NEMMCO said that today set an all-time record for electricity demand.Emma Daniell, from the power supplier SP AusNet said the result of the fires "prompted an automatic load reduction system to kick in, reducing power supply to customers". These rolling blackouts are occurring across the surrounding suburbs lasting one hour a time. The blackout affected about 200,000 homes, 1,200 traffic lights and "mobile base stations".  Trains and trams were reduced to a crawl, with buses replacing trains between Essendon and Kensington railway stations, and on the Werribee loop. Geelong was the region worst affected, with the entire city losing power from 4 p.m.  Power was restored to the central business district area shortly after 5 p.m., however many parts of the city were not restored until 8 p.m.The Australian Open tennis tournament was not affected.A video showing a man being tasered by police and subsequently dying at the Vancouver International Airport has been released to the media. The cause of his death has not yet been determined.Robert Dziekanski, 40, was immigrating from Pieszyce, Poland to live with his mother, Zofia Cisowski, in Kamloops, British Columbia. He did not clear customs at the airport for over eight hours and his mother was unable to locate him when she went to meet him at the airport. Since Dziekanski did not speak English airport security guards were unable to properly communicate with him. He started yelling at the airport staff because of this. He used chairs to prop open a door between a customs clearing area and a public lounge, he then threw a computer and threw a small table at a luggage section window.He had calmed down and was standing with his hands at his side in the customs room until four Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers arrived and tasered the man, at least twice. Dziekanski began to convulse and was tasered a second time after falling to the ground, where the four officers pinned him down and handcuffed him. He screamed before he stopped moving. Paramedics arrived at the scene, but were unable to revive him and pronounced him dead.Dziekanski's mother had told him to wait in the luggage area where she would meet him, not realizing that this was inside the airport's security zone, which was inaccessible to her. Arriving international passengers need to pass through customs first, before being able to meet people waiting to pick them up. His mother had tried in vain to get a message to him and eventually left the airport when told by airport staff that he wasn't there.Paul Pritchard, who had just arrived from China back to Victoria, shot a video of the incident and gave it to police. The police promised they would return the video within 48 hours. They gave him back his camera without the video.Pritchard immediately hired a lawyer, held his own news conference, and threatened that he would take them to court to get it back.CBC, CTV and Global television paid Pritchard several thousand dollars for the video, and he says he will use the money to take care of his father."It was against his [Pritchard's father] wishes completely and my lawyer's wishes as well. Profit is such an ugly word, and I hope people realize that it's not a personal profit," said Pritchard."I extend my heartfelt condolences to Mr. Dziekanski's family, knowing that I could not hope to speak to the loss that they have suffered. I would also like to express my concerns for those people who were in any way touched by this extraordinary and tragic occurrence - our employees working that night, the various agencies involved, the emergency responders and the passengers who may have come across the scene," Larry Berg, President and CEO of the Vancouver Airport Authority said on November 1.According to a RCMP spokesman in Vancouver, the four officers involved in the case will testify in court under the coroners request, but it is expected to happen sometime next year.Polish ambassador to Canada, Piotr Ogrodzinski, said "Mr. Dziekanski (was) a person who was agitated, frustrated, I think terrified, but not aggressive. He was not making a gesture that he intended to fight anybody" and "he didn't know what to do. In fact, he was in search (of) help. That is why it is a really very sad and deeply moving film to watch."The incident is being investigated by the RCMP, the British Columbia Coroner's Service, the Vancouver International Airport Authority, and the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP.A Vietnam registered fishing vessel sank Thursday in the South China Sea, leaving at least 27 fishermen missing. Chinese state media and officials have revealed that the vessel capsized and sank in high winds.Reports reveal that the name of the vessel is "Phu Tan", however the reports did not state the nationalities of the fishermen. The Phu Tan sank 185 kilometres (115 miles) west of Sanya located in China's Hainan province. Both China and Vietnam have sent rescue vessels to assist the fishermen. An officer at the Hainan maritime safety administration was quoted as saying, "We received a message asking for help from the vessel today. It has 27 fishermen on board." An official from Vietnam's National Search and Rescue Committee also said, "We just sent our vessels to look for it a few hours ago. This ship belongs to us." The official also revealed that the ship was a container ship.Officials in Manila have issued evacuation orders for a 6km (4mi) radius around Mayon Volcano in the Philippines as ash clouds, rivulets of lava, and sulphur dioxide levels indicate an imminent explosive eruption.Many residents, though, are hesitant to leave. Regional disaster coordinating council official Angel Capilli has said that the people who farm the rich soil near the volcano would be "forcibly" removed from the area should vulcanologists determine an explosive eruption is imminent.Mount Mayon has erupted 47 times in recorded history, with the last major eruption in 2001 shooting ash nearly 10km above the volcano.Police warn more bodies may remain to be found after yesterday's crash of a vintage jet killed at least seven people. The Hawker Hunter crashed into a busy road during the Shoreham Airshow in England.The plane failed to pull out of a large loop at around 1:20p.m. It hit the nearby A27 road, erupting into a fireball and leaving cars burned out and heavily damaged. The scene in West Sussex is near the town of Shoreham.Pilot Andy Hill is presently alive but critically injured in hospital. He has previously flown with British Airways and the Royal Air Force. Two of the dead are Worthing United FC football players, Matthew Grimstone and Jacob Schilt, who were on their way to a match. Also killed was Matt Jones, 24, who worked as a personal trainer. He came from Littlehampton and was giving a friend a lift. A vintage Daimler wedding limousine on its way to collect a bride was also caught up in the crash, but its owner Chariot Chauffeurs say they are unclear on if the driver was a fatality.Sussex Police and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch are investigating. Police Superintendent Jane Derrick said last night, "At this time we are continuing to search[...] It is possible that tonight and tomorrow we are going to find more bodies at the scene." She said it is believed all casualties except the pilot were road users. At least fourteen were injured. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry today said eleven people are "highly likely to have died in this tragedy", based upon "our initial work at the site" and "inquiries following calls to the emergency services from worried families and friends". He said officers currently remain at the "incredibly large" scene. There are plans to remove plane wreckage using a crane tomorrow.The pilot, Hill, was experienced, with years of display flying under his belt and a military career that included flying Harrier jump-jets. David Wildridge, another pilot who took part yesterday, said Hill is "well-known and well-loved", "very professional", and that his Harrier experience made him "the best of the best."The 1950s jet was decommissioned from military service in 1996 and sold at auction. In 2012 English entrepreneur Graham Peacock bought it for around £65,000. It is a regular at airshows. Tina Tilley, head of the local chamber of commerce, was at the show and said "From where we were we could see the jet came down very low and looked like it was going to scoop up — but it didn't. There were flames and we knew it was right on the A27. Everyone was horrified and there were people crying." Motorist Dom Lawson, whose car was narrowly missed, said "It was like something out of Die Hard". The road closure left thousands trapped at the scene as they could not remove their cars.In a statement, Prime Minister David Cameron sent "his heartfelt condolences to the families of the people who were so tragically killed [...] [his] thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the victims." The airshow is cancelled today.It is one of three deadly European airshow crashes in four days. On Thursday two planes carrying parachutists collided and crashed in West Slovakia. At least seven were killed. They had been practising for an airshow due to be held this weekend. Today two small planes collided during an airshow in Dittingen, Switzerland. One of the pilots escaped but the other was killed.Earlier this year a pilot was killed when his plane crashed during an aerial display at CarFest in England. In 2007 a Shoreham Airshow display recreating the Battle of Britain ended with a pilot dead following a crash.Investigators in Ireland have found wiring problems in several Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340s as part of their investigation into a fire on board one such aircraft that was forced to divert to Shannon Airport. The Virgin jet was headed from London Heathrow Airport to Chicago with 143 passengers and thirteen crew on January 11 this year. A small fire was noticed in a waste bin storage area in the first class section's bar unit.A damaged wiring loom could be seen sticking out of a hole in the compartments floor, and there was visible electrical arcing in the area. An attempt was made to control the situation by switching off electrical circuits, but both the fire and the arcing continued unchecked.The aircraft's captain declared an emergency and diverted to Shannon, which the airliner reached thirty minutes later. During that time, the crew used five 1kg fire extinguishers upon the fire, but each time the arcing continued and after about five minutes the fire reignited. Witnesses described the fire as consisting of “licks of flame”.After performing a safe emergency landing the airport's Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting department tackled the fire with a 5kg extinguisher but met with similar results. After consulting with the crew the jet's power was completely shut down, after which the fire was finally put out. Virgin initially claimed the fire had never occurred.Investigators with Ireland's Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) inspected the loom and found it to be “completely severed” and exhibiting “strong evidence of burning/arcing” according to a preliminary report released on Friday. The loom was identified as providing power and dimming circuits for mood lighting in the bar.The AAIU says that it seems the loom had contacted the metal waste bin in the compartment above. There should have been rails to hold up the bin and a protective metal cover, but “no evidence” of these was found and the report notes that “Initial inspection indicated the possibility that they were never fitted.”The bar unit is a modification exclusive to Virgin. The AAIU ordered all 36 of the airline's A340s worldwide inspected, with both France and the United Kingdom assisting with this. The UK has identified four other aircraft with faulty wiring, it has now been revealed. Virgin says that “A few minor issues were found and were immediately rectified,” and adds that “The installation of the bar was carried out in accordance with all relevant regulations. Virgin Atlantic continues to assist the AAIU in their investigation and looks forward to the full report with interest.”The AAIU says that "significant other issues are being examined by the investigation" in addition to the wiring defects. “These include the difficulties faced by the crew in isolating the damaged circuits, the emergency checklist, the design of the modification and the standards relating to such modifications,” said the report.Virgin's Boeing 747-400 fleet also has a similar bar installed on it, but there was not considered to be a risk to the aircraft's wiring on that model. The fire involved a bar added three years ago, with the aircraft manufactured in 1998.A Virgin Trains train travelling at high speed collided with a car near Copmanthorpe, Yorkshire, England, killing the car's driver.The accident took place at approximately 20:55 GMT when the Class 220/221  train, travelling at close to 100mph, hit the car which was on the tracks.    The train then partially derailed but remained upright, coming to a stop further down the tracks. The car driver is believed to have been killed instantly. No one on the train was injured. The car was not at a level crossing. North Yorkshire Police said that the car had left the road, driven through a fence and ended up on the track. The train was the 14:25 Virgin Voyager cross-country service from Plymouth to Edinburgh Waverley, capable of speeds up to 125mph, but was deccelerating on approach into York. There were 74 passengers on board. The line between York and Leeds was closed for several hours, delaying other services. Virgin Spokesman Arthur Leathley told reporters that Network Rail hoped to have three of the four lines in that section of the track operational by Tuesday morning.A 9 Carriage Class 390 Pendolino train, with as many as 180 people onboard, operated by Virgin Trains has derailed and crashed in Cumbria, England.The train was the 17:15 service from London's Euston Station to Glasgow Central. Witnesses said that several passengers have broken bones. All but one carriage have slid down the embankment and all of the carriages were derailed. 5 people are still seriously injured in hospital, including the driver Ian Black,  and 11 people altogether are still in hospital. Hospital reports early on Saturday morning indicate 1 death, 84 year old lady Margaret Masson from Glasgow."It's our understanding there are a number of people injured on the train. We think there are numerous injuries," said a spokesman for the Cumbria Fire and Rescue squad, Brian Mitchelhill."A train has crashed between Oxenholme and Tebay, but that is all we know at the moment. We have got two cars travelling there now and local police are attending," said a spokeswoman for the British Transport Police.At least twelve ambulances and at least five fire trucks are at the scene, along with 3 Royal Air Force Sea King helicopters, two mountain rescue teams and one police helicopter.  The rescue effort was hampered by limited access to the remote site and poor weather conditions.  "At the moment, we have reports of various injuries, from leg injuries to back injuries and head injuries -- ranging from minor to quite serious," said an unnamed ambulance official."The carriage I am in is completely on its side, it did a sort of bump - and I was thinking don't worry this fine - but then the swaying became very dramatic," said a BBC executive, Caroline Thomson. "Where I am there are some injuries - a woman with a very badly hurt back but I suspect further up the train it's a bit more serious."First reports suggested that the train hit something on the track at 20:15 near Grayrigg, between Oxenholme and Tebay, derailed and slid down an embankment.  Early investigators reports say a set of points will be the primary focus of the investigation. All but one of the train's carriages are said to have totally come off the tracks, a spokeswoman said. So far 12 passengers have been taken to The Royal Preston Hospital, where three casualties are said to be in a "critical condition" and one serious. 3 passengers with limb injuries are at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary.  People with minor injuries were taken to a nearby farm before being transferred to a Kendal hotel.As of 22:16, Sleeper services over the affected line have been suspended. Other major services are terminating at Preston or Carlisle according to (UK) National Rail Enquires.  A five mile cordon has been set up to seal the crash site as investigators from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch attempt to determine the cause of the crash.Virgin owner Richard Branson came to the site from his holiday in Switzerland and held a press conference at a safe distance, roughly 200 meters, from the site. Branson stated that the Virgin Train Pendolino was "built like a tank", and believed the track was to blame. All of the carriages retained their integrity and none of the windows broke. Mr Branson also praised the driver of the train for attempting to stop the train and not leaving the cockpit.Network Rail has checked 700 sets of rail points in response to the accident, though no speed restrictions have been imposed.At 11:45am on January 16, in Vladivostok, Russia, a fire broke out on the three upper floors of the Sberbank building.Photographs taken by eye-witnesses show people, who were trapped, dropping from 8th floor windows to their deaths. According to some reports the firemen who were dispatched to the scene were pre-occupied at the rear of the building. They had apparently been ordered to evacuate the bank and its management from the area, which was not under immediate threat.Official Russian media initially denied the fire, accusing the reports of being false.Russian media later confirmed 7 and then, 9 dead. Witnesses and those rescued from the burning building have claimed that the figure exceeds 50.A maintenance employee who worked in the building was quoted as saying, "I know at least about 13 dead inside ... that's the least I've noticed, not to consider those who've dropped down ...  8 of them dropped, looking at the three already dead on the ground, but they went through the windows without hope to be rescued ... They collected and hid the dead bodies inside. I work at this building! I know its layout very well! To declare, as it become clear, a less number of the dead later." "My daughter worked in a justice department," - Natalia, one of the witnesses said. "She said that there were actually much more dead - up to 70. She went on the dead bodies, getting out from the building … some of them were so scorched, that it was impossible to identify them… 9 victims? That's a lie!" Georic, a witness: "The cops ("menty"), whom I know, say that they've been loading the dead bodies all night long."Lelya has posted her evidence on January 21, 2006 on the web-site http://news.vl.ru/vlad/2006/01/18/tradegy/ "My brother worked in that building, on the 6th flour. So, the night after the fire they visited the building to collect the documents, etc. and they saw how workers transported the dead bodies. He said, there were 50-60.."The eruption of volcano Tungurahua on August 16 destroyed several small villages in the Ecuadorian Andes. At least 6 people have been killed and about 4000 residents of the affected area have been evacuated.The 5,023 m high volcano spat lava, stones and ash for several hours on Wednesday night. A 10km high ash cloud spread over an area of 740 by 180 km. Towns like Ambato or Riobamba, 30 km away from the volcano have been covered with up to 5cm of ash. Pyroclastic flows descending on the northwestern slopes of the volcano left a path of destruction behind. At least seven small villages and hamlets have been completely destroyed. The ash and rocks blocked the Chambo and the Peula river and the road Ambato - Baños, one of the main connections between the Ecuadorian highlands and the Amazon region. The Institute for Geophysics has lost an important part of its equipment installed on the slopes of Tungurahua, limiting their capability to monitor the volcanic activity.The Hydroelectric power plant Agoyan near Baños has been shut down since Wednesday night. On Thursday, air traffic in the whole country was limited due to ash layers on several airports. On Thursday the provinces of Chimborazo, Tungurahua, Cotopaxi and Bolivar have been declared a disaster area. Losses in agriculture due to the ash cover are estimated at $150 Million.On Friday, volcanic activity decreased to a calm that remained into Saturday evening, but the Ecuadorian Institute for Geophysics warns that a further eruption may be imminent.In 1999, after a long period of rest, the volcano started an eruptive process that continues to this day. After the first eruptions in October 1999 that produced a major ash out-fall and led to the temporary evacuation of more than 25,000 inhabitants of Baños and its surroundings, the activity continued on a medium level. In May 2006 it increased dramatically culminating in violent eruptions on July 14 and August 16.Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from areas near Mount Mayon in the Philippines on Tuesday, after the lava started flowing out of the volcano. Local scientists caution that Mayon might be on the verge of a powerful eruption."After the series of ash puffs and ash explosions of 1,000 metres, we cannot rule out a major explosion," said Cedric Daep, the head of local disaster relief operations, commenting that officials are intending to eventually evacuate up to 50,000 people."We are in the process of evacuating nearly 10,000 families around the 6-8 kilometre danger zone around the volcano. We have enough food for all these people for only a month," Daep added.An alert for the area surrounding Mayon has been raised, and about 20,000 people were evacuated from the foothills of the volcano. Thousands more people are expected to be moved out of the area later. They are currently living in evacuation centres set up by the Philippine government. Authorities noted that it might be until Christmas before most will be able to return to their homes."It's 10 days before Christmas. Most likely people will be in evacuation centres, and if Mayon's activity won't ease down we will not allow them to return to their homes. It's difficult and sad, especially for children." said an emergency management official, Jukes Nunez.The governor of the province where the Mayon volcano is located, Joey Salceda, commented that, in case of an eruption, the government was trying to have "zero casualties".Mayon erupted last in 2006; its most deadly eruption was in 1841, when 1,200 people were killed after the village of Cagsawa was buried. The volcano stands over 8,000 feet above sea level and has erupted 49 times since records were started, in 1616. The Philippines are also located along the "Ring of Fire", an area in southeast Asia prone to earthquakes, volcanos, and other seismic activity.Democratic Republic of Congo's Mount Nyamuragira, the most active volcano in Africa, erupted in the morning hours of Saturday, spilling lava out over its southern flank.The explosion occurred at about 03.45 local time, according to rangers from the Virunga National Park, where the volcano is situated.The warden for the southern sector of Virunga National Park, Innocent Mburanumwe, was a witness to the event. "I first thought [it] was the sound of war. I thought there was fighting again near our park station. Then I saw the mountain was on fire with sparks flying. We could see that we were not in immediate danger here at Rumangabo, but there are many people who live to the south of the volcano, where the lava is heading as I speak," he said, as quoted by CNN.Mount Nyamuragira is located around 25 kilometres from Goma, a city with 600,000 residents. According to a posting on Mburanumwe's blog, however, it is unlikely that the city would be affected by the volcano's eruptions. The mountain rises to 10,333 feet above sea level, and over 35 eruptions from it have been recorded since 1882.The Calbuco volcano in Southern Chile erupted twice on Wednesday. It was the first major eruption of the volcano in over fifty years.The Chilean National Geology and Mining Service said the second eruption was more powerful than the first. By reports, the first eruption caused some regional panic. Emergency officials had very little time to alert local residents because of its abruptness. The Chilean interior ministry said over 4,000 people were evacuated. The volcanic ash rose upward over six miles and has caused flight cancellations. According to Chilean health ministry sanitary planning division head Bernardo Martorell, the ash could cause water pollution and eye and skin infections. As of yesterday, Associated Press said no-one was reported injured as a result of the eruption. But on Thursday a ministry official said they fear another eruption may occur.This was not the only volcanic eruption in the region in recent years. Another volcano in Southern Chile erupted in back in 2011. Due to that violent eruption, hundreds of flights were cancelled and over 3,000 people evacuated.The 6,500 foot volcano is reportedly among the three most hazardous in Chile.Mount Ruapehu, a volcano in New Zealand, erupted at 8:20 p.m. (local time), without any warning and the government has closed all roads and railways surrounding the volcano including Desert and National Park roads. The eruption lasted for nearly ten minutes and is at this time considered to be a "minor eruption"; so far no state of emergency has been declared."At this stage it's not a civil defense emergency," said area councilman Paul Wheatcroft. Volcanologist Craig Miller calls the eruption a minor "Level 2 eruption." Level 5 is considered a major eruption. The eruption also caused a minor magnitude 2.8 earthquake.At least two people have been injured, one believed to be a climber who was climbing the volcano and was hit by a falling rock at the time of the eruption. Authorities are searching for that individual. One other climber was also on the volcano, but it is not known what the extent of his injuries are.Lodges and resorts near the volcano are currently being evacuated as ash lahars and flowing mud could be seen coming from the volcano on the east and north sides. Authorities have told everyone to stay away from and off the volcano.So far there have been no reports of damage to homes or businesses.There are concerns from local authorities that houses and towns may be affected by the eruption.Local municipal and provincial volunteers in Manitoba, Canada are exhausted in their efforts to divert the rising waters of the Red River of the North.It has been hard work with little sleep for the residents who live on the shores of the Red River to shore up their defences with sandbags, build dikes, clear frozen culverts and break ice jams Volunteers to spell relief for local volunteers and food are desperately needed."It's a week now we've been doing this ... you're talking four, five, six public works guys. In my one community we've got 25 volunteer firefighters and those guys have been going 24/7, so of course it's wearing them down." said Paul Guyader, Manitoba's emergency measures coordinator. "We're dealing with one of the biggest floods the province has ever seen," said Steve Strang, mayor of St. Clements, Manitoba  "We've put out hundreds of thousands of bags already. The municipalities are working very well, we're working with the provincial government, we've brought in every possible resource we could to address this issue.  The volunteerism within the community has been phenomenal." The Portage Diversion has taken some spring waters from the Assiniboine River and diverted the flow to Lake Manitoba.Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation has been totally evacuated, as well as many homes near the Canada – United States border.The cold weather is freezing the ice jams into place. Guyader has had 2 Amphibex Excavators operating on the river breaking up ice.The Red River is right now 16.7 feet (5 metres) above spring ice conditions. The Red River Floodway gates cannot be opened with the current ice jams.  "If we operate now, we can get ice jamming going into the floodway, jamming up against the St. Mary's bridge, as such, the floodway capacity would be reduced and would cause higher water levels in the city of Winnipeg." said Steve Topping, Manitoba Water Stewardship spokesman The floodway was constructed  in 1968 following the 1950 flood to divert the overflow spring flooding waters of the Red River. The floodway has been widened the since the 1997 “flood of the century" and the expansion is expected to be completed this spring. As well Manitoba built permanent dikes around communities within the flood plain since the last two major floods..The Red River waters will crest between the beginning of April to mid April, at which time also the weather should be warming up. Communities are bracing for higher water levels, more ice jams as well as melting snow in the warmer spring temperatures.Today, the day of the National Monuments of Chile, a group of volunteers from Santiago travelled to Lolol, a town located in O'Higgins Region. Lolol, named National Monument of Chile in October 2003, was severely damaged after the major February earthquake; the Church of the town, widely known as one of the oldest in Chile, is currently being restored."Their attitude is a clear sample of the conscience and love of the Chileans with their legacy, patrimony, especially after the earthquake," said the Executive Clerk of the National Monuments Council of Chile, Óscar Acuña, who appreciated their collaboration.Previously, 35 students of Tourism in the Technical Formation Center of the Los Leones Institute, were working in Lolol, between April 30 and May 1, helping to clean up the damage caused by the earthquake.The famous musical group, Bafona, also visited Lolol, and a few other towns that were damaged by the earthquake.Firemen were working to control a large fire in a party supply warehouse in the populous neighborhood of Once in the Argentine capital.The fire began in the fourth floor at approximately 15:15 hours and rapidly spread to the rest of the building, located on 2257 Lavalle street between Pasteur and Uriburu streets. The building houses a wholesale company called "Ciudad Cotillón" (Party City), which sells highly flammable elements like foam, carnival outfits, and products made with polystyrene.According to the firemen of the Federal Police, there exists a "real danger" of precipice of the damaged building, for which the Guard of Aid and SAME ambulances remain in the area.Nearby buildings were evacuated and the traffic was closed in the Larrea and Lavalle streets, from Tucumán up to Uriburu, producing chaos in the traffic.The fire's toxic smoke and smell expanded towards the northern zone of the city. More than 50 people were injured after inhaling the smoke. A cameraman of the Telefé suffered poisoning and was taken to the Ramos Mejía hospital.One of the firemen who was attacking the fire fell to the street below and suffered multiple injuries. He was moved with urgency to an hospital.The hospitals of the city were declared to be in a state of red alert, to be able to attend to those affected by the inhalation of toxic gases.Twelve people have died and twenty more were wounded following the collapse of a wall in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. At the time of the collapse Tuesday, the wall was supporting a shed under which residents were seeking shelter from heavy rain."I have been told that a shed of my bungalow collapsed where daily wagers gather every day seeking work," said police superintendent OP Pal. He is away from his house in Ambikapur, where the incident occurred, taking leave in Uttar Pradesh. Chhattisgarh authorities have promised Rs100 thousand (US$2.22 thousand,£1.39 thousand) to compensate each death, and Rs25 thousand (US$555.18,£346.92) for those injured. The shed was used as a bus shelter. The victims had been hoping to travel out of town.Ambikapur mayor Prabodh Minj said the 10-foot (3.05-metre)-tall outer wall &nbdash; built for security &nbdash; had been unmaintained for years. However, he attributes the cause of its collapse to the rainfall.The San Francisco Zoo has admitted that the walls of the enclosure around their Siberian tiger exhibit are too short. On December 25, Tatiana, one of two Siberians at the Zoo, climbed the wall and attacked three people, killing one. Reports say that Tatiana used her front claws to grab on the observation ledge of the enclosure and pull herself up out of her habitat.On Wednesday the Director of the Zoo, Manuel A. Mollinedo told the media that the enclosure's wall was 18 feet high, but today he came forward and admitted that the wall was only 12 feet 5 inches high. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) recommends the wall be at least 16 feet high. Mollinedo also said that he believes Tatiana escaped her enclosure by jumping or climbing it.The Zoo is accredited with the Association through 2011. According to the Association's website, for a zoo or aquarium to become accredited with the AZA, they must fill out an application and "the [AZA] Accreditation Commission [must] evaluate every zoo or aquarium to make sure it meets AZA's standards for animal management and care, including living environments, social groupings, health, and nutrition. We also make sure that animals are provided with enrichment, which stimulates each animal's natural behavior and provides variety in their daily routine." The commission meets twice a year to evaluate applications."The San Francisco Zoo is a great zoo, it's an accredited AZA member in good standing, and it has our support during this difficult time. AZA mandatory accreditation standards require that the San Francisco Zoo provide a thorough report to its independent Accreditation Commission, which will review it and determine any actions that need to be taken. We will not speculate on what action might be taken until the facts are fully reviewed," said a statement on the AZA's website posted on Wednesday."AZA-accredited zoos are safe. Until this incident, there had not been a visitor fatality resulting from an animal escape at an AZA-accredited zoo. AZA mandatory accreditation standards require safety and emergency protocols that go beyond federal, state or local requirements. Regular safety training and annual emergency drills are required by these mandatory accreditation standards," added the statement.According to Mollinedo the Association inspected the Zoo in 2004, but never pointed out that the wall was too short. The enclosure is also surrounded by a dry moat that is 12 feet deep at the corners and 13 feet deep at the center.Police are still investigating the incident and deny reports that the injured brothers Kulbir Dhaliwal, 23, and Paul Dhaliwal, 19 along with their friend Carlos Sousa Jr., who was killed, were taunting Tatiana by dangling a leg into her enclosure. Police do say that a footprint was found at the scene, but no further details are known. The brothers both received severe upper body and arm lacerations, but are expected to be released from the hospital on Saturday."We have no information at this point that they did or did not go over the railing," said Chief of the San Francisco Police Department, Heather Fong.On Wednesday, Fong stated that "[The incident is being treated as a crime] because we're not certain why the incident occurred - as result of human action or whether this was an incident where the animal was able to get out of the grotto."The Zoo remains closed for business and it is not known when it will reopen.The sets and props of popular claymation characters  Wallace and Gromit have been destroyed in a warehouse blaze this morning in Bristol, UK.The disaster comes only days after the US release of Nick Park's latest film featuring the characters, The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, which topped the box office chart and took US$16.1 million (GB£9.1 million) over the weekend.  The film is scheduled for UK release this Friday.Sets and models from the new film escaped as they had not yet been added to the Aardman Animation collection hosted in Bristol.  Among the damage caused by the blaze, the character Morph was lost; for many UK children the appearance of this character in Tony Hart's BBC art programmes was their first introduction to stop motion animation.The warehouse, located near Bristol's central railway station, dated from the Victorian era and was formerly part of Ismbard Kingdom Brunel's Great Western Railway.  Ten fire crews attended the blaze, in which flames shot 100ft into the air, from 0600 BST into the afternoon, but were unable to prevent the collapse of the roof, interior walls and all three floors of the building.An investigation will begin once the building has been made safe.A former warehouse of VR Group, a Finnish railroad company in Helsinki, Finland, is currently on fire. Reports say smoke can be seen throughout the City Center.The warehouse was scheduled to be demolished next Monday.Heavy rain, combined with melting snow from a previous storm, have caused the US state of Washington to issue the largest evacuation order in the history of the state. Over 30,000 people living along the Puyallup River were informed on Wednesday night to leave their homes due to the flooding, combined with threats such as mudslides, avalanches, and overflowing rivers.In some places rain totalled over 6 inches, including 6.86 inches at Marblemount, and 6.3 inches at Snoqualmie Pass. A spokesman for Washington Emergency Management told the media "This is the largest evacuation in scope and scale. We haven't dealt with something like this before. It's hitting more populous areas and an industrial area. It has a much more devastating impact on the economy."The flooding has had a large impact on travel in the state, including 20 miles of Interstate 5 being closed on Wednesday night because of rising flood waters on the roads. Washington's three roads that provided a way through the Cascade Mountains were also closed, but to the rising threat of avalanches on the roads. Interstate 90, one of the roads through the Cascade Mountains, is set to re-open Thursday, said a spokesperson for the Washington Transportation Department.In the town of Orting, slightly south of Tacoma, the town's fire department urged all of its 26,000 residents to leave the town yesterday, due to the Puyallup River and near Carbon River being at dangerously high levels. Forecasters predict that these two rivers could reach all-time highs in water levels, and could cause severe damage to property and businesses. The Puyallup River is forecast to reach 1.5 feet over its flood stage of 10 feet later today, endangering homes and offices throughout the area.The storm is expected to end by Friday, says Rich Marriot, meteorologist for KING channel 5. "It should be all over with by late Thursday. The rain will stop down here and the snow will stop in the mountains," he stated, "Most of the major crests are going to be early tomorrow morning, but it will probably take most of Thursday for those rivers to get back inside their banks.""This will be a memorable experience if it hasn't already [been] this winter," said Johnny Burg, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, "It will be like two feet of icing on the cake." The Stanwood Camano School District, which serves both Stanwood and Camano Island, had to close on January 8 due to flooding at the schools and on major highways, such as Highway 532, the only road that connects Camano Island to Stanwood. 30 Stanwood High School students helped sandbag various areas of the community on January 7.Other major highways across Western Washington were closed, such as Highway 530, also known as the Pioneer Highway, which was closed at the exit to Interstate 5, not allowing access to the highway, as the nearby Stilliguamish River breached a dike to hold it back. State Route 9 was also closed in the Snohomish River Valley, as the Snohomish River overflowed.At least nine people have been reported killed in a serious collision incident between two metro trains in Washington, D.C., United States.The collision which occurred on the Red Line between Fort Totten and Takoma Park stations of the city's Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority during the early evening (1700 local time) is also reported to have injured a number of other passengers. The fatalities include the operator of one of the trains. At 7:58 pm local time, two more fatalities were confirmed, resulting in a total of six deaths.In a statement to media, Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty was quoted as saying  "With the four confirmed fatalities, it is my preliminary understanding that this would be then the deadliest accident in the history of our Metro train transit system," at a news conference following the incident.The Metro's general Manager John Catoe was also quoted as saying "We are extremely saddened that there are fatalities as a result of this accident, which has touched our Metro family. We hope to have more details about the casualties later today. Our safety officials are investigating, and will continue to investigate until we determine why this happened and what must be done to ensure it never happens again,"The cause of the collision incident is still unclear, although it has been suggested by some sources that a derailment or head on collision may have led to the incident.Scotland's Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) has criticised the national force for failing to stop a driver reported to them for being drunk behind the wheel. A subsequent crash wounded four.Police's Tayside Division received a report on June 30 last year from a member of the public that a 19-year-old motorist was drunk. The man subsequently crashed near Forfar, seriously injuring himself and one of his three passengers. The other two occupants sustained lesser injuries.Police referred themselves to PIRC John McNeill, who said "My investigation found [...] there was potential to stop and breathalyse the person thereby preventing a later serious road accident". His team examined radio logs, CCTV, police communications systems and procedures, and accounts from officers and the public.The report calls on Police Scotland to remind officers of standard procedure for dealing with suspected drink-driving calls. Last year the now-defunct Tayside Police force was criticised for a similar car crash in which a man hit a pedestrian with his vehicle after police received notice he was driving drunk.Environment Canada is reporting that the water levels of Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Superior and Lake Michigan have dropped and that Lake Erie could lose two feet or 15% or more of its water level by the year 2050."We should pay attention to what they're telling us. That's not to say they're perfect, and there's always room for uncertainty, but . . . it's the best information we have at this point," said director of the Great Lakes Center at Buffalo State College, Joe Atkinson.Reports also state that if any of the lakes lose a few feet of water the event could be an "economic disaster.""That would just be an economic disaster. Water levels are what make or break this industry," said spokesman for the Lake Carriers Association, Glen Nekvasil. He also added that if a drop in water levels of a few feet in any of the great lakes, could render the shipping "inviable."Researchers at Buffalo State College are not convinced that a major problem is looming."It's really just too early to make a decision," he said. "Water levels have fluctuated a lot in the last [few] hundreds of years, so it's hard to put that to global warming," said researcher with the Great Lakes Center at Buffalo State College, John J. Freidhoff.Some officials admit that the loss of water levels in the lakes are not in the "top ten" problems that the Great Lakes face."The water being lost through climate change is not in our top 10. We have other fish to fry, so to speak," said Lake Erie specialist at the Envirnmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Great Lakes National Program Office located in Chicago, Illinois, Dan O'Riordan.Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are at least 45 cm. below their yearly average and Lake Superior is only 20 cm below its average, but Lake Erie and Lake Ontario have made a recovery from their averages.Residents in Michigan are complaining about foul smells, dead fish, muck and garbage that litter the shorelines of Lake St. Clair which is also 7 inches below its level this year when measured in mid-summer. "It's not just down a little -- it's down a lot," said Macomb County resident, Jim Doran who resides in the township of Harrison. "It's not a pretty sight, and it smells," added Doran.Shipping companies are reporting that at least 200-500 tons of cargo will not be able to be shipped in the lakes if the levels continue to drop. Freighters will lose the ability to ship at least 270 tons of cargo for every one inch of water that is lost."We're down 200 to 500 tons per trip, compared to last year," said Nekvasil.Further rain has continued to fall across southern China after the country was devastated by floods earlier this week.176 people have been confirmed to have died as a result of the flooding, and around 50 more are officially missing. Xinhua, the state news agency in China, has reported that the flooding in the Pearl River Delta was the worst in the area for over fifty years.The Chinese government says it evacuated 111,476 in the Sichuan Province. In Wenchuan County, 72,000 were relocated. Over the past week some 1.3 million people have reportedly fled their homes.The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) issued a warning on the situation before the first wave of flooding. "Faced with the increasingly severe rain and flood situation, at 16 o’clock of June 12, Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters of Guangxi urgently started level 2 flood control emergency response and required the relevant departments and places to prepare immediately so as to ensure the work of flood control and drought relief," the CMA said in a statement released late last week.In Edinburgh, capital of Scotland, part of an underground water piping system has exploded, forcing local residents to be evacuated. The pipe broke around 03:30 BST (0230 UTC) today, within Allan Park Road, causing flooding in the Slateford area of the city.A spokesperson for Scottish sewerage and water corporation Scottish Water explained: "Early this morning reports were received of flooding in Allan Park Road and Scottish Water operatives attended the scene. A large diameter water main had burst. The water was shut off and re-routed via other pipes to keep supplies flowing to households in the area. Repairs are under way and the customers affected by the flooding are being offered assistance."Stating that repairs to resolve this problem had commenced and would take a few hours to conclude, Lothian and Borders Police have advised that the floods may disrupt the supplies of water and other utilities, as well as transportation on roads and railways in the west of Edinburgh. Hospitals and rest homes in the region have been notified of the incident and bottled water is now anticipated to be supplied at these buildings.According to local residents, Slateford Road (A70), a major throughway, was closed for several hours this morning. Telephony and broadband in the area is disrupted, with local residents and businesses having to rely on cellphones. Further work, such as digging up the road and using temporary traffic lights, will be required to restore these services in the area.As of 13:15 BST (1215 UTC), Scottish Water has excavated around the burst main, but has not yet begun work on replacing the damaged section of pipe.Two passengers on a Mediterranean cruise ship were killed by a rogue wave on Wednesday. The incident occurred off the north-east coast of Spain. The ship, named the Louis Majesty, had left from Barcelona, Spain and was headed for Genoa, Italy.  The giant wave broke the windows on deck five of the ship, resulting in two fatalities as well as another fourteen injuries. The two victims were German and Italian citizens. Following the incident, the ship returned to Barcelona. The ship, carrying over 1300 passengers, is expected to continue its journey after the injured are moved from the ship for treatment.According to French officials, there had been no previous trouble with the ship. The waves were believed to have been 26 feet (8 meters) high. The ship is 660 feet (200 meters) long, and had 732 cabins onboard.After gaining strength in the western Caribbean last night, Hurricane Dean made landfall as a Category 5 storm on Mexico's Yucatán coast at about 4:30 a.m. this morning (EDT). The storm struck just north of Chetumal, the capital of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. However, hurricane-force winds were felt over 60 miles (~100 km) away from the center of the storm, and tropical storm conditions impacted areas 175 miles (280 km) away.The Mexican government ordered the deployment of over 4,000 troops, and declared a state of emergency in the state of Campeche. Some areas braced for up to 20 inches (510 mm) of rain.Dean made landfall as a category 5 storm, before being downgraded hours later to a category 3 storm. Later Tuesday afternoon, Dean was downgraded to a category 2 storm. Currently, the storm maintains category 1 status, with top sustained winds at 85 mph (137 km/h). The hurricane moved towards modern oil installations of the Yucatan Peninsula, prompting evacuations of offshore oil rigs that produce most of Mexico's oil and gas.Forecasters warn the storm could pick up strength as it crosses the Bay of Campeche and turn into an even more destructive hurricane before making a second landfall on Wednesday.A hurricane warning remains in effect along the Gulf Coast of Mexico from south of Progreso to Tampico.Forecasters do not believe it presents a threat to the United States.Dean is being blamed for 13 deaths already.A military weapons storage facility in al-Masalmyiah, just north of Aleppo, Syria has exploded, killing at least 15 Syrian soldiers and injuring at least 50 others. The explosion occurred on the grounds of a military academy's infantry school where weapons and ammunition are stored.The blast, which occurred at 4:30 a.m. EEST (UTC+3) is believed to have been caused by excessive summer temperatures, but other reports suggest that a gas leak may have sparked the blast. The incident is reported to not be terrorism related."[The blast was] not the result of sabotage. There is a heat wave and temperatures reached close to 50 degrees (Celsius) [Nearly 115 (Fahrenheit)], which caused an ammunition dump to explode," said an unnamed Syrian official.Firefighters report several deaths and injuries, but also said that the fires caused by the blast have been extinguished.A plane crash at about 6:00 pm local time yesterday at the Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida killed four people. The aircraft involved in the incident was a twin-engine Piper PA-44 registered to FIT Aviation LLC, a Melbourne, Florida flight school.According to the National Transportation Safety Board when the plane took off it encountered trouble with the left engine. It crashed into the tarmac, causing a fiery explosion. The dead have been identified as 26-year-old flight instructor Dheni Frembling, 21-year-old and 22-year old flight students Jordyn Agostini and 22-year-old Kristopher Henegar, and his 26-year-old brother Kyle Henegar.The plane was flying a training flight from the Bahamas to Melbourne via Palm Beach when it crashed.A blast at the Apache Energy plant on Varanus Island on June 3, 2008 cut off one-third of Western Australia's (WA) gas supply, Apache Energy says that it could take up to two months before the supply from Varanus Island gas plant will be partially resumed.The gas crisis in Western Australia is set to worsen this week, "I think the most difficult times are ahead of us. I think this week will be very difficult and I think the following week will be very difficult, and I mean very difficult", The WA Premier Alan Carpenter said.Dawn Brancheau, a whale trainer, died in an accident at the SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida on Wednesday, at around 14:00 local time. The incident involved an 18-year-old killer whale, Tillikum, also called Tilly. The Orange County Sheriff's Office report that trainer Brancheau has 16 years of experience. Brancheau was reported dead after being recovered from the pool.Witness to the incident Victoria Biniak told WKMG-TV, "He was thrashing her around pretty good. It was violent. [The whale] ...took off really fast in the tank, and then he came back, shot up in the air, grabbed the trainer by the waist and started thrashing around, and one of her shoes flew off." In response to this accident, SeaWorld San Diego canceled its Shamu show, a show involving the whales at the San Diego location. "We're terribly saddened by the loss of the member of our SeaWorld family, it doesn't matter what park," David Koontz, a spokesperson for SeaWorld San Diego said.A 75 year old wheelchair-bound Australian man has been rescued from his home in New Orleans. Keith Faulkner was rescued by a neighbour after floodwaters stranded him in his home for five days. Mr Faulkner is suffering from cancer. He was left behind by his family as floodwaters rose. "When the flooding started his family had no choice but to leave themselves, and he was left in the house as best they could manage," the Australian ambassador to the United States said. The man was eventually moved by neighbours to a nursing home in Lafayette. "He was rescued by a neighbour after five days stranded in his house and he's been in a nursing home in Lafayette, Louisiana," said Alexander Downer, Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs has been criticised for the lack of support provided to Australian victims of the disaster. The Labor Party has been particularly scathing in its attacks. "The bottom line is this: when it comes to helping Australians on the ground, the Australian Government has failed miserably to persuade its closest friend and ally - the United States Government - to allow Australian consular officials access to help our own people," said opposition defence spokesman Kevin Rudd. Mr Rudd was referring to the US governments refusal of a request by Australian consular officials to enter New Orleans and search for Australians. "You need a few days to allow people to assess the situation and to deploy personnel. But a week later, we have one official go in and can only stay there until night-time and then has to skedaddle out of there. I mean, what's happening here? It's just not good enough," he added. Some people have been critical of the Australians caught in the disaster. Former Federal Liberal Pary Minister Wilson Tuckey attacked the victims, suggesting that they should have left New Orleans earlier. "Why was the woman quoted by the Leader of the Opposition today so insistent, not that the Prime Minister get her out of her problems, but the Australian taxpayer get her out of her problems, when in fact all the warnings we heard here in Australia [said it] was unwise to stay," he said.A spokesperson for the White House has discussed the situation in Burma in a recent press conference. He started by saying that "we [the US government] are obviously very concerned about the reports coming out of Burma and we mourn the loss of life."He then explained the aid given by the US in the aftermath of the cyclone in Burma. "The embassy was able to provide an initial package of aid and assistance that goes through the World Food Program, as well as other aid entities." The initial aid package provided by the US government will be worth US$ 250,000.A journalist then claimed that the initial aid package provided by the US Government was just a "drop in the bucket, " due to the large size of the storm. Scott Stanzel, the spokesperson, responded by saying that "we're [the US government are] in the process of assessing what more we could provide. So we're just in the initial stages, obviously, of this tragedy, so it's something that we're taking a very close look at."Stanzel finished discussing the Burma situation by saying that "officials at the [US] embassy are in touch with Burmese officials and we want to be as supportive to the humanitarian crisis as we can."Over 4,000 people are dead and nearly 3,000 are missing and dozens are injured after Cyclone Nargis hit the country of Burma.A "white powder" has been discovered at the Michael J. Dillon courthouse at 68 Court Street in downtown Buffalo, New York.According to Buffalo Fire Chief, Don Mcfeely, "a call was placed to 911 at approximately 1:58 p.m. [EST], by a woman working on the third floor" of the courthouse after she opened a "letter which contained a suspicious white powder."The building was immediately evacuated, which had at least 200 people in it, but it is unknown where the occupants of the building went, as only fire, police, and government officials were observed around the outside of the building. No decontamination site was seen, but according to witnesses, Hazmat officials were seen entering the building with bio-hazard suits.Mcfeely also stated that the letter "contained codes," but would not elaborate on what the codes were or what they meant and that a "message was written on the letter which suggested that the powder was harmful." Preliminary tests performed on the scene determined that the powder was not Anthrax, but the test did not "rule out anything else that maybe harmful," stated Mcfeely. "The letter has been removed from the building and has been taken to the FBI field office in Buffalo for further tests."The letter was not addressed to anyone specifically, being addressed to just the courthouse itself.So far no injuries or illnesses have been reported and according to Mcfeely, no one has been taken to the hospital, although stretchers were seen entering the building. The fire department was not on high alert but blocked off the area surrounding the courthouse as a "precautionary measure," said Mcfeely. The area was opened to traffic again at about 5:00 p.m. and the courthouse was open for business today.The FBI has not released a statement and it is still unknown what the powder is.The Mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, has ordered most of the local police force to stop rescue efforts and shift their efforts to prevent looting [1]. At the same time, FEMA has reportedly been blocking aid shipments into the city on the grounds that it is too dangerous. A rescue helicopter attempting to retrieve stranded people from New Orleans' Superdome stadium was reportedly shot at; but this has not yet been confirmed. A member of the National Guard was reportedly shot, but was not seriously injured. Official reports say that one New Orleans police officer was shot in the head, but was expected to survive.  Other reports say that police stranded on the roof of a hotel were being fired upon by looters in the streets. Meanwhile, reports from many blogs and grassroots journalists about police officers looting cars and stores have started to filter up to the mainstream media [2].Food, diapers, and other supplies are the target of most looters. Some are reportedly taking non-essential and luxury items, such as TVs and computers.  Reportedly, gun and pawn shops are also a popular target for looting.  Earlier today, buses were taking the most vulnerable away to the state capital of Louisiana, Baton Rouge. Evacuees in the Superdome are also being moved by bus to the Astrodome in Houston, Texas.US President George W. Bush, in an interview on ABC television, condemned the looting, saying "I think there ought to be zero tolerance of people breaking the law during an emergency such as this."A hospital in Gretna was evacuated after a supply truck carrying food, water and medical supplies was stopped at gunpoint. Spokesman Stephen Campanini estimated there to be approximately 350 employees in the hospital, along with between 125 and 150 patients. Campanini said, "There are physical threats to safety from roving bands of armed individuals with weapons who are threatening the safety of the hospital."  Despite this, some of the other rumors of looting have proven to be false. One of the most prevalent was the story that armed looters laid siege to the Children's Hospital. The Times-Picayune reported that this story was false.Rachael Ford, co-ordinator for New Zealand's Candor Trust reveals in a Wikinews exclusive what Candor asserts is the hidden cause of deaths on New Zealand's roads.Candor Trust is an organisation based in New Zealand that helps educate New Zealanders about the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs.Candor Trust says that the message that "Speed kills" is the "number one road safety threat".In 2000, the number of road accidents causing injuries was 7,447. Last year, this rose to 10,738 - the highest since 1995. Statistics provided by the Ministry of Transport show that in the same period, the number of hospitalisations too rose by about a quarter (25%), to 7,427.Saying that the general level of safety on New Zealand's roads has "gone down the gurgler", According to the Trust, the "unjustified emphasis" on speed, which it says is far from the greatest factor in fatalities, only serves to distract from bigger issues."Candor Trust urges a rethinking of the "Speed kills" message, pointing out that it does not predict that record numbers of hospitalisations accompanying the record numbers of speeding tickets issued.The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and Land Transport New Zealand (LTNZ) both say that a one percent decrease in the mean speed will cut the death toll by four percent and the injury rate by two percent. Dr. Patrick Meffen has told transport officials from the Ministry of Transport that factors other than the drop in average speeds are responsible for the drop in the death toll.Provisional figure for 2006 show a four percent decrease of the mean speed from 101 km/h to 97 km/h coinciding with an increase of people being seriously injured. The number went up by 330, a 15% increase from the 2000 figure of 2,243.Candor Trust says that it is incredible that other agencies, including LTNZ, are continuing to spread the message that speed kills, even when an experiment to show what happened when users took party pills and then drove was stopped when no fatalities occurred, just concern over adverse effects.Candor Trust said: "The survival of road users depends on the goodwill of planners who need to come clean and admit the 'reduced harm correlates to reduced average speeds' hypothesis is disproven in the present NZ context."Ms Ford said: "It is not OK that the damning Breen report [a review of road safety to 2010 strategy] expressed concerns [that] our road safety policy is not sufficiently evidence based, and yet we carry on doing as we've always done." She said that because of this, the road victim disability services are overloaded and unable to meet the needs of the victims.The speed theory is based on a formula called 'Ashtons formula'. Ashtons formula is based on demonstrated association, which is said to need the weakest scientific evidence, but Candor Trust says that it does not account for variables such as the vehicle standards.Dr. Meffen told the LTNZ that it is not true if a crash occurred at 95 km/h and another at 105 km/h, the slower one would be more survivable. He said that the media releases are misleading people, making them believe in a false sense of security. "An important spin off from the misuse of these statistics has been the concept promoted by media of survivable accidents at or near open road speeds. In reality the chances of surviving around the open speed limit are low and purely random."Candor Trust said: "Speed control must stop dominating policy - over limit speed is only present at 18% of fatal crashes. Safety has nothing to do with legality, and putting all our eggs in the speed basket as it's easily 'enforceable' has been a mistake." Over half of all fatal crashes the speed is under 60km/h, and fatal side-on crashes occur at speeds usually below 40 km/h.In 2005 and partly 2006, $2,385,000 NZD was spent on advertising to prevent speeding, the majority of the advertising budget. Speeding teenagers, who are of the most concern, do not make up the bulk of the toll.Candor Trust said the most important issue that could end up saving lives is the use of 1990-dated imports in cars that are being used by the under 25-year-olds on New Zealand roads, or as Candor Trust described the roads, "State Goat Tracks."Candor Trust calls for an immediate review and reconstruction of how the police deals with crashes, and want information on inattention and drug intoxication to be collected following a crash. A police source told Candor Trust that there are often times when crash investigators argue with the police when the police try to tick the speed box, because they are "overly keen". Candor Trust want a better and more effective road safety policy, especially when it comes to speed.Also in the latter half of this month, January, 19 fatal crashes occurred and 16 of those were the result of a centreline cross, which usually occur because a driver is fatigued or otherwise impaired, and they move the steering wheel; or "run off road events." Ministry of Transport statistics shows that a head-on collision in which one of the cars is travelling 80 km/h or more will most likely result in a fatality. Research conducted in America also showed that mobile phones are not a major cause of deaths when compared to other causes. In the 3 seconds before a crash, 80% of drivers are inattentive and local studies implicate fatigue or drug abuse as the main risk factors for that.Wikinews spoke to several residents of the US state of Texas finding varying opinions, and responses, to the threat from the West Nile virus; this, in contrast to the troubling media reports released recently. The state as a whole has seen more than 400 confirmed instances of the illness so-far this year.A Longview woman, said, "[...] It's terrifying. I'm so scared." The woman was quick to point out a virus-related death occured in her city the same day. When asked about her daily routines, in light of the virus, she said, "I don't go outside. I stay indoors. West Nile [virus] is bad." The Director of Nursing for a large encampment located near Tyler said their operation had seen no cases of the illness, despite serving over 19,000 campers this summer. Her staff took no special precautions during August.Although having some worries, Jimmy Philmont, 39, of Fairfield told Wikinews, "[...] I don't let it keep me up at night. Overall, I'm not too scared." Asked if he was aware of  recent virus-related deaths in Texas, Philmont said, "Yeah, I am. That's kind of scary. But, you have to live your life, you know? The world is hot now. You can't go hide in a hole somewhere." Earlier in the month, Tim Whitley, a city official in Malakoff, told Wikinews his city had began using a pesticide specialist to spray twice-weekly. Whitley explained two treatments per week is more often than usual for the city, "With the concerns in Dallas, we're taking it seriously", he said.A nurse at a senior activity center in Austin told media she'd taken time to educate their facility's clients about the virus and proper precautions; Adding, "They feel less alarmed and we try to protect our folks here [...]". Mark Kitsmore, 54, of Tyler said, "Honestly, I'm not too worried about it." He jokingly commented, "I've probably used a little more bug spray over the past few weeks, though."Twenty-six people have died so-far this year as result of having contracted the virus, approximately half occurring in Texas. The mayor and county judge in Dallas have declared a state of emergency in response to the virus.File:Diego Grez - 2.jpgAn 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile on Saturday, causing significant damage throughout parts of the country. Diego Grez (a Wikinews correspondent by the pen name MisterWiki) was in Pichilemu at the time of the quake. Four days after the quake, Peter Coti, also a Wikinews contributor, was able to chat with Mr. Grez about what happened Saturday morning.Paniahue, Santa Cruz, Chile – Wikinews' Diego Grez interviewed Juana Bustamante, a Chilean earthquake survivor from Santa Cruz, who lost her home. Juana told us her story of what she faced when the earthquake took place. The building where she was living fell down while she was on the second floor. Its first floor practically disappeared.Wikinews reporter Mike Morales interviews fellow Wikinews contributor Peter Coti, who is on the scene at a north eastern storm in the United States in New Jersey. Coti tells Wikinews what happened in the area of Ridgewood, New Jersey and provided pictures of the damage and area.In late December, Indonesian cargo ship MV Namse Bangdzod vanished in local waters. The tanker, gross tonnage around 1,150 and loaded with crude palm oil, had over ten crewmembers. Wikinews examined data and contacted experts and local authorities in an effort to establish further details.The exact date of disappearance is unclear, with industry publications reporting either December 27 or December 28. Crew totals are also unclear, with both eleven and twelve reported by industry sources while The Jakarta Post reports a captain and eleven other crew. Wikinews has contacted the Command and Control Centre of the Coast Guard seeking to clarify, among other things, the date of the disappearance and is awaiting a response.Wikinews is also awaiting responses from both the Coast Guard and the National Search and Rescue Agency detailing the efforts being made to find the ship, which was last known to be in the Java Sea. MV Namse Bangdzod sailed with cargo from Sampit, a port town on a river in Borneo; it was last bound for Jakarta. It is owned and operated by Indonesian companies and also registered in Indonesia. The 75 m (250 ft) ship was built in 1993 in Japan.Ships broadcast their position and other information via both the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and the Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system. AIS is a ship-to-ship safety system, but can also be detected from further afield by satellites. Marine Traffic's AIS tracking database shows a reestablishment of AIS contact by MV Namse Bangdzod on January 6, with a pattern described by Marine Bulletin as "rather hectic and kind of confused". In addition to asking local authorities, Wikinews sought expert input on the AIS data.Dr. Tristan Smith of University College London, a shipping researcher with expert experience interpreting AIS results, explained to Wikinews that crews might turn their AIS transponders off on purpose for security reasons, such as "in certain sea areas where piracy is a risk" in order to "avoid attracting unwanted attention. This can involve them being turned off for several days at a time." Doug Miller of Milltech Marine, a firm specialising in AIS, told our correspondent an AIS transponder will broadcast automatically provided it has power and antennae, even if the crew abandoned the vessel. Baslan Damang, a security official from the port of departure, on Tuesday told The Jakarta Post radio broadcasts were being used to alert other traffic such as fishing vessels to look out for MV Namse Bangdzod. He added authorities "are still waiting for updates on the tanker's condition, so please refrain from speculating that it had been hijacked". As of yesterday, no oil slicks or other evidence of accidents have been found along the scheduled route the vessel was due to take. A major search continues.Miller and Smith both acknowledged faults with the AIS system on-board as possible explanations, with Miller describing issues with the signal between the transponder and the satellite receiving it as one potential scenario for intermittent data reception. He too suggested a hypothetical scenario, in which "the AIS equipment has been tampered with or has been turned off for some of the time — either intentionally or accidentally or due to a power malfunction." Smith called the disappearance an "interesting" case; Miller said "It is a little hard to definitively say what's going on". Miller explained that while transponders generally transmit every ten seconds "even if the transponder is transmitting there is no guarantee that other vessels or MarineTraffic can see it". "It could also be a power supply issue or faulty transponder", said Smith.Smith told Wikinews "There are also some operations done on ships containing hazardous cargoes[...] where all risks of sparking/arcs need to be removed and radio transmitting equipment is sometimes turned off for this reason." He said this applied to product tankers, but the long duration of AIS downtime would in this instance be unusual if this is the reason. Smith had one more theory: Namse Bangdzod could be the victim of identity theft, with a second vessel conducting manoeuvres it wished to conceal while falsely transmitting information identifying itself as Namse Bangdzod. Smith told Wikinews this might happen in cases of illegal fishing. He stated "In this scenario, it would normally be expected that both the legal and illegal transmission would be received but depending on how Marine Traffic handle this, it's possible the two signals could be confused."Smith drew attention to LRIT as another method for search and rescue personnel to find the tanker. Unlike AIS, which is a safety and tracking system, LRIT is used for maritime security by seagoing nations. Created under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization, LRIT allows states to examine data about ships bearing their flag, visiting their ports, or in or near their waters. Like all vessels exceeding 300 tons, Namse Bangdzod is required to transmit LRIT data. Search and rescue bodies can also access this information; Smith told Wikinews he believed this would include foreign navies with ships in the Java Sea. Singapore, India, and Australia have in the past conducted emergency searches of the Java Sea: All three nations offered military assistance after Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 vanished in December 2014.Marine Traffic's website's most recently publicly available AIS result, as of Tuesday, showed the ship underway a few miles off Jakarta. VesselFinder listed no AIS results for the last month. Vessel Tracker's database had no sighting of the ship within the last 59 days on Tuesday; the website noted the AIS signal received from Jakarta but declared the ship was not actually there. Maritime Connector has an entry for the ship in its database but has no location data available.Local authorities, according to Maritime Bulletin, have noted other unusual AIS data. The website yesterday  suggested piracy, perhaps to obtain the valuable cargo, is now the most prominent theory. The Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association reports a value of US$473.60 per metric ton of crude palm oil as of November 2018, with the price decreasing that month. "Its plausible that an explanation [why] the AIS transponder is not transmitting is that it had been turned off by pirates who wanted to hamper the efforts of a rescue mission" Smith told Wikinews yesterday.Yesterday the Search and Rescue Agency told The Jakarta Post it was intending to end its search on the basis of piracy, which is outside its remit; the paper also spoke to the Navy, who told it this was as-yet uncomfirmed and noted no ransom has been sought and the ship vanished from an area without previous piracy problems. Four Navy ships assisted by aircraft are searching. "We will continue searching until we find it," 1st Fleet Command's Navy Information Agency head Arba Agung told The Jakarta Post, which also today reported location data falsely showing the ship in Sunda Kelapa Port after its inaccurate position in Jakarta Bay was recorded.A compilation of brief news reports for Wednesday, February 3, 2010 .No oil is reported leaking from the Woodward's Oil fuel tanker The Nanny aground in the Northwest Passage off the coast of Nunavut. The 110 metre (360 ft) tanker was carrying 9 million liters (2.4 million gallons) of diesel fuel to remote settlements in Canada's Arctic regions when it grounded on a sandbar. Last week the cruise ship Clipper Adventurer struck an uncharted rock in the same region, trapping 110 tourists and crew aboard for the two days it took the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker to reach the ship. On August 27th another Woodward's tanker, the Mokami, ran aground near Pangnirtung.Gale force winds ripped through Sydney and the South Coast of New South Wales late on Saturday night, causing widespread damage and extensive power outages, with up to 30,000 homes going without electricity at one point. The strong winds caused trees to be uprooted, in one instance crashing down upon an unsuspecting motorist, killing a man in his 60's and severely injuring his wife.The State Emergency Service (SES) has responded to over 800 calls for help to repair damage caused by the storms, however the storms have subsided somewhat and flood warnings around Bega and Moruya have been withdrawn.A wildfire affected eighteen hectares of scrubland, grassland and eucalyptus in the Ranguilí area of Lolol, Chile.Due to strong winds and climatic conditions in the area, as well as the imminent risk of it spreading to homes, the National Emergencies Office of the Ministry of the Interior (ONEMI) declared a red alert for the commune on Sunday. It was then decreased to yellow alert, until it was finally lifted on Tuesday, after the wildfire was extinguished.Both Chile's National Early Warning Centre, and the O'Higgins Region ONEMI monitored the wildfire.Lolol is a town located in the Colchagua Province of O'Higgins Region, in Chile. It is home to about 6,200 residents, and part of its urban center is considered a "Typical Zone" by the National Monuments Council.The recent Jesusita Fire in Santa Barbara County, California, has burned more than 8,600 acres of land over the last four days. Over 75 homes were destroyed, and more than 30,500 residents were evacuated. Another 23,000 are on standby to leave immediately when the notice comes down.  Approximately 3,500 homes along with 100 businesses are currently threatened by the blaze."Right now, if you are not evacuated in the Santa Barbara area, you are sheltering evacuees," said city Fire Chief Andrew DiMizio, "We saw the fire spread laterally across the top of the city and the fire front extend to almost eight kilometers now."The firefighting crew on guard against the fire has amassed 2,300 firefighters with 246 fire engines, fourteen air tankers, fifteen helicopters as well as a DC-10 jumbo jet tanker.There have been no reports of residents being injured, however 11 firefighters have sustained injuries battling the fire, placing three in the hospital.Massive wildfires in western and central Russia have killed at least 52 people and blanketed Moscow in dense smoke and smog. According to BBC News, around 560 fires were still burning on Friday.More than 800 wildfires have been reported this week in Russia, which is currently suffering from the worst heat since records began over 130 years ago. Since June, temperatures in the country have been rising, and Moscow was expected to reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.78 degrees Celsius) on Friday, about 25 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) above the normal temperature for this time of the year.The environmental protection agency of Russia's capital has already stated that {w|carbon monoxide}} levels in the city's air were five times as high as safe levels and that particulate pollution levels were three times as high as safe levels.The dense smoke also caused chaos at Moscow airports. Visibility at Domodedovo Airport was reportedly around 400 yards (365.76 metres) on Friday, and many flights were either delayed or arrived late.At Russia's Alabinsk military base, located around 45 miles (72.42 kilometres) southwest of Moscow, artillery rockets were moved to a location where they would not be threatened by the fires, said Russia's Ministry of Defence. The fires also burned close to a nuclear missile warning site near Moscow, but a spokesperson for the Russian Space Forces said that the warning center's fire brigades had extinguished two fires in the area. Previously, materials from a nuclear research center in Sarov were moved out of the way of fires to avoid a possible explosion occurring.Russian officials have received criticism over their handling of the blazes. Last week, Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, dismissed five military officers for letting a fire burn hangars at an air base near Moscow. One of Medvedev's aides said on Friday that mayors will be debriefed and that those who did not adequately respond to the wildfires "will be brought to justice." Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said last week that local officials not dealing with the fires should resign.The spree of wildfires has left at least 3,000 people without homes. Seven regions are now under a state of emergency, and 28 more are under a state of emergency for farmers with crops failing in the heat.Fire crews from other nations in both Europe and Asia were arriving to help fight the fires, and a shelter was set up in Kaliningrad to support 150 children from central Russia who were displaced by the crisis.Two large wildfires burn uncontrolled north of Los Angeles, California. The blazes, known as the Marek fires, have burned over 3700 acres and caused the evacuation of more than 1200 people. Furthermore, at least 30 mobile homes were destroyed.One confirmed fatality has been reported and described as an unidentified transient who had been using a cardboard shelter beneath a freeway overpass. However, the Associated Press reports a second related death from a traffic accident.Authorities expect to order more evacuations before the fires can be brought under control.Fires started Sunday due to Santa Ana wind conditions in the San Fernando Valley and Angeles National Forest on the northern outskirts of Los Angeles. Affected communities include Porter Ranch and the Lopez Canyon area.Santa Ana winds as strong as 65 miles per hour fanned the flames, which jumped the eight-lane 210 Freeway. Both the 210 Freeway and 118 Freeway were closed during Monday morning rush hour. Firefighters have contained smaller blazes that occurred elsewhere in Southern California near the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita and in neighbouring Ventura County.Local resident Glenn Bell told Reuters about his last minute evacuation.  "The sparks were flying down on us," he said, recalling how a locked gate nearly trapped him and his family, "and as I'm busting the gate... I see the cypress trees that are right next to our house on fire."Los Angeles County fire inspector Frank Garrido described the problem as "a blowtorch we can’t get in front of," according to The New York Times. "Wind is king here, it’s dictating everything we are doing," he continued.Scott Stephens of the Center for Fire Research & Outreach at the University of California, Berkeley calls Southern California's Santa Ana winds "some of the strongest, most severe fire winds in the world."Among the problems caused by Santa Ana winds, which blow from the nearby Mojave Desert toward the Pacific Ocean, is a tendency for hot embers to leapfrog and start new fires.  Santa Ana conditions tend to occur from autumn through spring and can reach peak speeds of 70 miles per hour (113 kilometers per hour).Fire crews have battled numerous wildfires across portions of Oklahoma during recent days. At least eighteen fires have been reported across the state, one of which severely damaged the town of Luther, nearly destroying it. Media sources indicate the fires have damaged over 68,000 acres.Many of the fires burned throughout Saturday night. In the central part of the state, various rural areas and small towns were evacuated; officers went door to door in some locales to notify residents of the impending dangers. A spokesperson for the American Red Cross reported approximately 50 people stayed overnight in an emergency shelter set up in the town of Cushing, just outside of Oklahoma City.The state continues under a state of emergency. The governor, Mary Fallin, visited the town of Luther on Saturday, extending her sympathies amidst the disaster. She told reporters, "It's heartbreaking to see families that have lost so much." She has also issued a statewide ban on all burning activities.A large lightning storm this week sparked over 800 wildfires in northern California. A lightning storm this past Friday caused wildfires burning from Mendocino County to Monterey County, the latter a county that has been declared an emergency zone, along with Trinity County. Of the 800 wildfires burning, recent numbers say that around 200 are unattended, some being left to burn themselves out.Over 100,000 acres have been burned from these wildfires. Already an early fire season, the National Climatic Data Center reports this has been the driest spring in 114 years of record keeping. The lack of precipitation and dry thunderstorms have turned the northern part of the state into a smoky inferno. Smoke is so bad in Sacramento (and as far away as Reno) that health authorities have encouraged the public to stay inside, and in Monterey County some residents were ordered to evacuate.Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger asked for help from other states, and Nevada and Oregon have thus far responded. Oregon has sent 2,400 firefighters already. Nevada itself has struggled with wildfires, nearly 100 fires are estimated to be burning. Oregon does not have as many wildfires due to their saturated climate.NORMAN, Okla. – National Weather Service officials are warning of continued fire dangers throughout Oklahoma and Texas due to serious drought conditions.More than 220 homes and businesses have been destroyed by fire in Oklahoma since Nov. 1, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. Wildfires in 29 of the state’s 77 counties have claimed more than 360,000 acres. Meanwhile, officials in Texas say 238 homes and 254,555 acres have been lost to wildfires in that state since Dec. 26.Unseasonably warm weather and wind gusts of up to 40 mph have combined to make an already dangerous situation worse across the Southern Plains, which also include parts of Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico, said Jason Levit of the National Storm Prediction Center in Norman.“The region also continues to remain in a severe to extreme drought situation,” Levit said. “Dry surface vegetation will continue to serve as an excellent fuel for any fires that develop.”Some dry areas, such as the Rocky Mountains and Great Lakes, may soon see some much-needed rain. Levit says the already fire-ravaged Southern Plains will have no such luck, however, and people should be aware of the severe danger that will continue to threaten the region.In Oklahoma, state authorities and the National Guard have established a command post in Shawnee, about 40 miles east of Oklahoma City, where they have been joined by officials from the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the National Weather Service.The state was granted access to relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Dec. 28, said Gov. Brad Henry. The Governor requested fire management grants to help cover expenses related to the wildfires that began the previous day. FEMA’s approval means funds are now available to local governments and volunteer fire departments that responded to the blazes in Hughes and Seminole counties. Requests involving nine other counties were approved in the days that followed.Fires hit the northeastern part of Oklahoma City, the state’s capital and largest city, on Sunday. Fires were said to have destroyed 20 homes over the weekend.A National Guard helicopter and firefighters from North Carolina were sent to battle a blaze near the town of Davis, in south-central Oklahoma, on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the BIA sent two airplanes to help fight a fire near Eufaula, in eastern Oklahoma. Three other BIA aircraft aided crews fighting fires near Wewoka, in central Oklahoma, and additional fires were reported near Knowles, Oklahoma City, Ponca City and Tishmingo.Authorities said additional National Guard helicopters and Forest Service planes are available to battle other fires as they break out.In addition to teams from North Carolina, other firefighters from Alabama, Florida, and Tennessee have arrived and are being stationed throughout the state.The Oklahoma State Medical Examiner’s Office said one man has died from injuries sustained from recent wildfires. A 68-year-old Hughes County man died Dec. 28 from thermal burns and smoke inhalation. The death is in addition to that of a 68-year-old Carter County woman who died last month while trying to use a garden hose to save her home from being consumed by flames.The governor’s office said the state continues to await word on a request for a federal disaster declaration made Friday. A disaster declaration by President George W. Bush would qualify Oklahoma for federal funds to place firefighters ahead of where blazes are burning, and would provide temporary housing assistance and low-interest loans for those whose homes or businesses have been destroyed.Texas authorities say they have 92 aircraft and 650 state workers working to fight fires, and have been joined by crews from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. The U.S. Forest Service is also helping the state to handle the emergency.Despite efforts, wildfires on Monday claimed nearly the entire town of Ringgold, destroying 45 buildings that comprised about 80 percent of the town.Friday's major winter storm over the northeastern United States claimed a 227-year-old tree on the estate of the first US President George Washington, Mount Vernon, in Virginia.  As of yesterday, officials overseeing the Mount Vernon estate indicated the Canadian hemlock has been collected for preservation and special projects.The hemlock, planted in 1791, was toppled by the gusts reportedly up to 70 mph (about 110 kph) on Friday.Mount Vernon was Washington's personal estate, where he conducted most of his two presidential terms between 1789–1797 because the initial White House was not completed yet. According to Mount Vernon officials, the hemlock is the best documented tree at the estate, sent by New York Governor George Clinton as a gift delivered in a whisky barrel. The New York governor is not related to the 42nd President Bill Clinton, however George Clinton would later become the United States's Vice President under the Thomas Jefferson and James Madison administrations between 1805–1812. Other US historic trees recently fallen include the seventh President Andrew Jackson's southern magnolia at the White House and the Pioneer Cabin giant sequoia in California's Calaveras Big Trees State Park known for the car-sized tunnel cut into the trunk.Nearly 300 people turned out at a protest meeting held in Vladivostok, Russia on January 21st. Relatives and friends of the victims and survivors of the recent fire, as well as ordinary citizens were there and full of anger. They had come to protest against the authorities, whom they say mishandled the rescue operation in the terrible fire and have withheld the truth about the real number of dead.The slogans at the protest read, "Who will tell us the truth?", "We want to know the truth!", "Our lives cost nothing!", "Authorities should respond!", and "Firemen are those who should be set on fire!"The Chief of Vladivostok City Police Department colonel Nikolay Panchenko commented: "The meeting participants are sure, that the authorities hide a true number of the dead and refer to the web-site fire.zloe.net."The web-site "Truth about the fire in Vladivostok" has been created to spread information about the fire.Panchenko said "We verified the published messages, but none of them was confirmed. We have detected the two authors of the messages. One of them has already denied everything he wrote, another is still hiding out".Today, a news agency in Vladivostok, which maintains another web-site where information about the fire is collected, reports they received an official order from the government services. Additional private information about people who post comments on news.vl.ru has been requested.Some human rights experts warn that the witnesses may be persecuted in a situation where the authorities want to hide the truth, and thus to escape responsibility.File:Map of USA highlighting Texas.pngWitnesses say a truck was idling near the scene of an explosion at a Texas refinery which killed 15 and injured over 100 others on March 23, according to U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Manager Bill Hoyle."Witnesses saw vapor in the area of the truck and observed the engine begin to rev up and race," Hoyle's statement said. "This behavior by a diesel engine indicates the presence of a flammable atmosphere entering the air intake. A driver reported trying to shut off the engine but was unable to do so." Hoyle's statement continued, "There are multiple possible sources of ignition in an operating refinery unit and we have made no determination about the ignition source at this time."The investigation has been delayed by BP and Occupational Safety & Health Administration officials, who are trying to preserve evidence at the site for their investigation. They are also concerned about further injuries from hazards left over from the explosion, such as falling debris and unstable structures. The Environment Protection Agency also detected benzene in the atmosphere over the plant, which was treated with a layer of foam.BP has retained control of the plant since the March 23 accident. Police arrived quickly the day of the explosion, but left after the initial emergency was over."Our officers could respond over there, but they don't have a clue," Texas City police Sgt. Curtis Pope told the Houston Chronicle. "The fact is they have chemical and equipment hazards. We don't know the chemicals."Two railfans and a security officer who were at the  Metrolink station in Chatsworth, California on the afternoon of Friday, September 12, when Metrolink Train 111 collided with an oncoming freight train, say the train had received a green signal just before the collision. The witness accounts were published in a recent Los Angeles Times article. The wreck killed 25 passengers and injured dozens more.The accounts, if true, contradict the preliminary findings of officials investigating the crash, who have said that a red light was ignored. It was estimated that 350-400 passengers were aboard the Metrolink train when it crashed.The signal in question is located about a mile from the Chatsworth train station but, according both to witnesses and to investigators, is clearly visible from the station platform. One of the civilian witnesses, a railfan, was expecting the oncoming freight train, but says that when he looked at the signal to see whether the train engineer had an indication to proceed or not, he saw that it was green. A few days later, both he and the other civilian witness told a Federal investigator what they had seen. According to an expert interviewed by the Los Angeles Times, false green railway signals are an extremely rare event, but they do occur.It is not uncommon for eyewitness reports to disagree with each other or to be unreliable. However, in this case, the accounts of three witnesses agree with each other, and one of the witnesses is a professional security guard.  It is not known whether there are other witnesses who disagree with the three.Federal investigators have been focusing their investigation on cellphone records, which show that the engineer of the ill-fated Metrolink 111 commuter train had been sending and receiving text messages, including one only 22 seconds before the crash. They also conducted extensive tests of the signaling system. The signaling system functioned normally during the tests, and computer records show that the signal in question had been red immediately prior to the collision.Federal regulations require railroads to notify the Federal Railroad Administration any time that a false signal to proceed is known to have occurred. A number of different conditions can cause false proceed signals, including communication circuit failures, wiring errors or, more rarely, software bugs. In one instance, such a design flaw on an Amtrak line went undetected for nearly 35 years.A woman has died after being struck by a hose attached to a fire truck in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Gertrude King, aged 82, came from the town of Somerville.On Tuesday, she was standing on a median strip on a road to allow a fire truck to pass through. As the truck passed, the fire hose attached to it dislodged and was left dragging behind the vehicle; the elderly woman was struck in the knees by the trailing hose. According to Cambridge Police, Gertrude died in Massachusetts General Hospital on Thursday. Deputy Superintendent Jack Albert of Cambridge Police stated, "[w]e do know the hose is 200 feet long and we believe that the hose was completely off the truck and being dragged at the time it struck."An investigation is underway. The police have said that, at present, they are unable to determine the cause of the loose hose. Gertrude was said to be unable to get out of the way in time. Elanor Raniri, who lives in the same apartment complex as Gertrude, said, "[s]he was very special. It's unbelievable. It's hard to take in."An unnamed woman from Mitchell, Queensland, Australia has died after her pet camel knocked her down to the ground, stomped on her, and then laid on top of her, in what police suspect was an attempt by the camel to mate with her. The woman was found at 18:30 (AEST) by her husband after he finished feeding his stock at the family ranch.The woman in question had a fondness for exotic pets, and received the camel as a 60th birthday present. The camel was ten months old, and weighed 152 kg (336 lbs). Camels have lived in Australia since they were transported there in the 1840s. Camels are not normally aggressive, but can become more dangerous if treated as pets.According to the police, the camel displayed possible mating behaviour. Craig Gregory, Detective Senior Constable for Queensland Police said, "I'd say it's probably been playing, or it may be even a sexual sort of thing." One camel expert, Chris Hill, claimed that the animal's behaviour was definitely sexual.A woman in Buffalo, New York in the United States is in critical condition tonight at Sisters Of Charity Hospital after she accidentally set herself on fire.The unnamed elderly woman was receiving oxygen for medical problems in her home and lit a cigarette, and the oxygen coming from her mask facilitated the ignition of her clothing, setting her on fire.Despite her "severe" burns as described by firefighters on radio communications, she was still able to dial the emergency line in the U.S., 911.In the U.S. only 4% of all residential fires were reportedly caused by smoking materials in 2002. These fires, however, were responsible for 19% of residential fire fatalities and 9% of injuries. The fatality rate due to smoking is nearly four times higher than the overall residential fire rate; injuries are more than twice as likely. Forty percent of all smoking fires start in the bedroom or living room/family room; in 35% of these fires, bedding or upholstered furniture are the items first ignited.A woman has died after the vehicle she was travelling in plus a second vehicle were both struck by a train at a level crossing in Herefordshire, England. The woman, who was aged 50, was reported to have been involved in a collision involving two cars and a train at a level crossing located near to the village of Moreton-on-Lugg at 1034 GMT on Saturday.The woman, who has currently not been identified, was airlifted to a hospital where she later died of the injuries that she had sustained.  The woman's husband, who was travelling in the same vehicle as her at the time of the crash, suffered from shoulder and pelvic injuries.  The occupents of the other vehicle — a 12-year-old girl and her mother — were also given treatment for minor injuries and shock and were subsequently discharged.The British Transport Police "are currently investigating an incident which took place at Moreton-on-Lugg level crossing in Herefordshire," according to a spokesperson for the police force. He stated: "Two vehicles were struck by a train on the crossing at 10:34AM on Saturday. The occupants of the first vehicle, a husband and wife who live locally, were taken to hospital. The female, aged 50, sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to hospital where she has sadly died. Her husband was taken to hospital by ambulance where he was treated for minor injuries."An elderly woman has died in a house fire in South Yorkshire, England. The woman, who is currently remaining unidentified, was blind and 93-years-old when her bungalow in Sheffield caught fire as a result of an accident in her kitchen yesterday afternoon.An internal investigation into the fire has suggested that while the woman was cooking, she dropped a towel onto one of the stovetops while attempting to move a pan on the cooker. The towel then set alight. When she attempted to put out the fire, the towel dropped to the side of the cooker, alongside some plastic bags. A smoke alarm sounded; a nearby resident heard the alarm and went to assist. The neighbour managed to break into the bedroom window of the bungalow in order to be able to get inside the building. The person made it to the hallway but had to double back upon seeing the fire and the smoke. It is believed that the woman was overwhelmed by the fumes given out from the plastic which was burning.At around 1350 GMT, fire service workers entered the elderly lady's residence to find her collapsed inside the kitchen. People investigating the incident have come to the conclusion that this particular fire was an accidental one. A spokesperson for the South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service noted: "Neighbours who tried to enter the property were fought back by smoke and flames."A woman in Australia has been killed in a shark attack. The attack occurred at 5pm (Local Time) just off Amity Point, North Stradbroke Island, south-east of Brisbane.The woman, described as 21, had lost both arms up to the elbow and sustained severe wounds to her torso and legs. She was carried to shore by friends and was then flown by rescue helicopter to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. Surgeons were unable to save her.The woman was holidaying from Brisbane with a church camp and attempts to contact her family have been made.Emergency Services Rescue Helicopter crew officer Rod Morgan said the woman had suffered massive blood loss. "She was very pale" he said, "We were diverted right away and were able to be on the scene within minutes and were able to have the patient at hospital within an hour of the attack.""She had life threatening injuries she had lost significant amounts of blood and the patient had what we would call an altered level of consciousness where it wasn't able to communicate directly with the patient" said Queensland Ambulance paramedic Lachlan Parker. There were many witnesses at the scene and they are now being interviewed by Police at Amity Point. They are described as being distraught.One witness, who asks to not be identified, described that the victim was swimming in the sea with her Border Collie. When the attack happened, the dog ran home to raise the alarm."I was across the road from where she was staying and I saw the dog come flying up the road all wet and shivering and whimpering," she said, "Then a little boy came running up and said the girl had lost her leg and her arm and everyone ran out of the house towards the beach. It was just a little black-and-white dog but he was crazy so I locked him under the house."Other reports claim that the woman had been scuba diving in murky shallow water approximately 15 metres from the shore.The woman is believed to be from McDowall in Brisbane, but her name has not yet been released.A resident of Amity Point for 20 years, Brad Ross, said tourists visiting the area have been warned of potential attacks; "The shore just falls away into 30m of water and there are plenty of bull sharks out there. People know when they enter the water there they're stepping into a shark habitat." Other beaches on the island are protected by drum lines.Queensland state police inspector Peter Harding believes from the severity of the woman's injuries that she was attacked by a group of bull sharks, a species known for aggressive behavior this time of year. Water police will search for the sharks today and as a result, beaches on the east and west of Amity Point have been closed.This is the first attack in the area since August 1972.Local wisdom cautions against allowing dogs in the water at swimming beaches, because of a fear that they attract sharks, perhaps because of residue accumulated from fleas which live on the dog's blood.A young woman was killed Friday night after an accident occurred on a gyrating ride at the Playland amusement park in Rye, New York in the United States. The woman, Gabriela Garin, was a worker at the amusement park, and had worked there for the past seven years. The accident occurred near the end of Garin's shift; as she was loading riders onto the ride. The ride's new operator, unaware of Garin's presence, started the ride while Garin was still on it. The new operator then noticed Garin, and shut the ride down in 20 seconds, but Garin had already been ejected from the ride and killed, according to a park spokesperson. The ride is an attraction that spins people around in two-seat cars, inside a darkened tent to flashing lights and music. This incident is not the first in the ride's history. In 2004, a seven-year-old from Connecticut managed to free herself from the ride's restraining bars, and climb onto the front edge of her seat. She fell soon after the ride started. A safety precaution was put in place after this incident, however, the spokesperson acknowledged that it was not followed when Garin was killed.The company which owns the ride shut it down, along with two other rides it owns at the park. This is the fourth fatality in the park's history. The park features more than 50 rides, a pool, and a beach. It attracts more than 1 million visitors annually.A woman who held the Guinness World Record for having the world's longest fingernails has lost them in a four-car accident in her hometown of Salt Lake City, Utah in the United States.66-year-old Lee Redmond was seriously injured after she was ejected from the sports utility vehicle (SUV) she had been a passenger in. It had collided with one car, causing it to collide with two other cars on Tuesday February 10. She is expected to make a full recovery."[Her nails] were damaged beyond repair," reported the BBC, quoting Guinness World Records, who also said that Redmond's nails were "a fundamental part of her life and unique character". The cause of the crash is not yet known and an investigation is ongoing.Redmond is credited by the Guinness Book for having a combined fingernail length of 28 feet, the longest on record. She has been growing all eight fingers and two thumbnails since 1979. Her longest of all nails was her right thumb, which was 2ft and eleven inches long.Before Redmond was named as the record holder in 2006, Shridhar Chillal from India had the longest at a combined length of just over twenty feet.Andrew Burris, from Curtis, Ohio, and member of Carpenters Local 1138, died in Toledo, Ohio when the construction platform he was on fell around 9:15 a.m. EST. The platform was attached to the northbound side of the Veterans' Glass City Skyway, a new bridge on Interstate 280. The platform was clamped to the side of the bridge, and broke off. Burris fell about 95 feet to the ground, where he landed on the east side of the roadway. Authorities from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  do not know why the platform broke free from the bridge. The Toledo Police department does not suspect foul play, and considers the death to be accidental. The $220 million bridge is scheduled for opening in June, 2007, and is the largest construction project in the history of Ohio. "On behalf of Director Beasley and the Ohio Department of Transportation, we extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Andrew Burris," said ODOT District 2 director, Dave Dysard. "We also extend our condolences to his relatives, friends and his fellow workers who have made us proud through their commitment and dedication to their work. Andrew was a part of the team that took the pylon to the top back in 2005. For four-and-a-half years, he was an integral part of the team that worked to complete this vital link for our community."This is the second fatal accident on the bridge. On Presidents' Day in 2004, five workers were killed and four were injured when a crane collapsed. Mr. Burris was from a line of carpenters, and kept a scrapbook of the project. His mother, Ruth, was quoted as saying "I think he felt closer to heaven there."At least 24 states across the United States are reporting that honeybees are disappearing and the reason is not known, but scientists have an idea of what might be causing the disappearance."Every day, you hear of another operator. It's just causing so much death so quickly that it's startling," said acting state apiarist, Dennis vanEngelsdorp who works for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.At least 30 to 60 percent of the bees on the west coast of the U.S. have died or disappeared. The east coast and the state of Texas have reported a nearly 70 percent loss of bees. A 20 percent drop in bee population is expected each winter and is considered normal."Anything above [a] 30 percent [loss] is concerning," added vanEngelsdorp."It’s as high as 100 percent in Texas and one guy in Virginia has 27 hives left out of 1,400 hives. It’s to the point now where we’re starting to contact some crisis management people," said David Hackenberg who is one of the largest beekeepers in Pennsylvania."I’ve never seen anything like it. My hives are just getting emptied. There’s nobody home," said beekeeper, David Bradshaw.The bees are reportedly leaving their hives to search for flowers to pollinate, and then never return home. The queen bee, nurse bee and baby bees remain in the hives only to die. Some call it a "colony collapse disorder.""We see dead bee hives with no dead bees and nothing will live in the hive. If I had to guess, 40 percent of the bees along the East Coast are dead since September of last year. In the West Coast, it’s 25 percent and almost everybody is on either coast," said a beekeeper in Columbus, Montana, Lance Sundberg who runs the Sunshine Apiary bee hives. Sundberg has said that his bee count went from 5,600 in June of 2006 to less than 3,800 in February of 2007. He says mites might have caused at least half of the loss with the other half unexplainable.Scientists say that the cause of the deaths and disappearances could be natural causes. Some also say that some bees  became disoriented or could have been infected with mites, which could cause a lethal virus to overcome the bees. Other theories include the spread of a bee virus or a possible fungus which could cause them to die, poor nutrition and inbreeding. Scientists say that cell phone towers and crops that have been genetically engineered are not suspected of being a cause.The disappearances could be more serious than they sound-without bees to pollinate crops, in a few years time there could be a dramatic drop in the harvests in the affected states.Tracheal mites were the cause of a drop in bee population in 1985. After two years passed, the Varroa jacobson mite, which sucks the blood out of the bees, killed nearly 80% of bees in Montana.Pesticides may also be to blame which could cause the bees to literally get lost on their journey back home."One-third of the food you eat is dependent upon honeybee pollination. If that one-third doesn’t happen, I don’t know what will occur at the grocery store," added Sundberg.Montana is the U.S.'s 5th largest producer of honey and exports hundreds of thousands of bees to California to help with the pollination of almond plants.Other countries reporting bee disappearances are:CanadaSpainPolandGreeceCroatiaSwitzerlandItalyPortugalGermanyEnglandThe 12th UN-Climate Conference was opened in Nairobi on Monday November 6, 2006. The aim of the negotiations is to find ways of assisting the developing countries to adapt to climate change. The formulation of goals for lowering greenhouse gas emissions after the Kyoto-Protocol runs out in 2012 is high on the agenda. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) reported half-a-percent rise in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere during 2005. This rise is destined to continue unless more positive action is taken. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) forecasts crop failures, flooding and threats to freshwater supplies. Actions to mitigate the effects of climate change in developing countries include developing new species of food crops, constructing sea defences, planting vegetation, improving the water-supply infrastructre in vulnerable areas and increasing public awareness of the need to conserve water.Some 6,000 delegates will discuss these issues 6 - 17 November 2006.The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) senior-level round-table discussion on International Technology Cooperation on Environmentally Sound Technologies will take place on Tuesday, 14 November, 13.15 - 14.45Of special interest will be the new report from UNFCCC on how climate change will affect the African continent.On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron called for G7 action to correct what he named the international crisis of wildfires currently destroying Amazon rainforest in and around Brazil. G7 was already scheduled to meet this weekend. The call was quickly seconded by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson."Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rainforest — the lungs which produces 20 percent of our planet's oxygen — is on fire. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit, let's discuss this emergency first order in two days!" Macron told the world on Thursday via Twitter.Merkel seconded Macron's recommendation the fires be added to the agenda."We stand ready" tweeted Johnson "to provide whatever help we can to bring them under control and help protect one of Earth's greatest wonders."Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro opposed Macron's statement: "The French president's suggestion that Amazon issues be discussed at the G-7 without participation by the countries in the region evokes a colonialist mentality that is out of place in the 21st century[.]"G7, or the Group of Seven, is an informal group of seven countries, the United Kingdom, United States, France, Canada, Germany, Japan, and Italy, though the European Union is also often involved. It grew out of the Group of Six, which started in the 1970s as a place for noncommunist countries to talk. Unlike G20, which focuses on economics, G7 meetings usually center on politics.Brazil is not a member of G7, but it is part of a pact between the European Union and the South American group Mercosur, which requires Brazilian compliance with the Paris Climate Accord.Brazil's National Institute for Space Research has reported there have been 85% more wildfires in Brazil in 2019 than there were in 2018. Bolsonaro has said publicly the Amazon rainforest should be opened up to agriculture, amongst other economic uses, and his critics, which include non-governmental environmental activism group Greenpeace, blame him for encouraging farmers and agrobusiness to set fires.Around 3:00 p.m. local time on Monday (1800 UTC), smoke in the atmosphere turned the city of São Paulo, Brazil dark enough to require artificial lighting in a combination of cold front, clouds, and smoke from wildfires burning the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The phenomenon lasted about an hour.Experts attribute this to human activity. Amazon Environmental Research Institute Director Ane Alencar, in remarks to UOL.com.br, said, "This year we do not have an extreme drought, as there was in 2015 and 2016 [...] In 2017 and 2018 we had a sufficient rainy season. In 2019, we have no weather events that affect droughts, such as El Niño [...] There's no way the weather can explain this increase."Around one million indigenous people live in the Amazon rainforest.World leaders at the G8 Meeting at Gleneagles have made statements following the bomb attacks in London today.Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom offered this official statement following the attacks:The dreadful events in London this morning have deeply shocked us all. I know I speak for the whole nation in expressing my sympathy to all those affected and the relatives of the killed and injured. I have nothing but admiration for the emergency services as they go about their work.France's Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin made a short statement to offer moral and material support to the population of London. The "Vigipirate plan" was raised from "orange" to "red".Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the attacks were:Roundly condemned by the Australian government.We are 100% behind the British government and 100% behind the British people at this time and completely condemn this appalling terrorism.Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin made a statement from the G8 summit, stating:Today, we have been witness to acts of cowardice and terror. The London bombings are an unspeakable attack on the innocent and on a way of life.On behalf of all Canadians, I have extended to Prime Minister Blair the condolences and the sympathies of our nation. We pray for those who have lost their lives, and for their families.Canadian security forces are working closely with those of Great Britain. We stand ready to provide any assistance that may be required at this difficult hour and in the days and weeks ahead.Our collective freedom has come under attack today by those who would use violence and murder to force extremism upon the world. We must and we will stand against these terrorists. We will do so together. And we will prevail.US President George W. Bush made a statement in Edinburgh, vowing to be "extra vigilant" in pursuit of terrorism.On the one hand, you have people here working to alleviate poverty and rid the world of AIDS. The contrast couldn't be clearer between the hearts of those who care about human liberty and those who would take the lives of innocent folks. The war of terror goes on. We will not yield to terror. We will spread an ideology of hope and compassion that will overwhelm their ideology of hate.In Spain, which saw attacks on Madrid last year, the Spanish Government said it would help the UK, "pursue the criminals who have carried out such a repugnant attack against a city that was celebrating its election as the host of the Games of the XXX Olympiad". The European Parliament President Josep Borrel, expressed his condolences, saying: As president of parliament and a citizen of a country that only last year experienced the horrors of such terrible attacks. I want to send a message of solidarity with British people, we all stand with you, British people, and we will never let atrocities or terrorism defeat the values of peace and democracy.Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh of India expressed outrage at terrorist attacks in London, saying these only "underscore our contention that terrorism is a global phenomenon that needed to be tackled with concerted effort." Recalling that India was the victim of a terrorist attack only two days ago when heavily armed men assaulted a shrine at Ayodhya before being killed, Dr Singh said the incidents demonstrated that "global terrorism does not respect international boundaries and we all need to work together to counter it."Danish Prime Minster Anders Fogh Rasmussen calls the attack in London "terrible": Once again we witness the barbaric attacks of unrelenting terrorists against innocent people -- civilians, women and children". He further emphasizes the importance of the western world not giving in to terrorism: "They may never be allowed to reach their goal through death and destruction. Therefore I support the continuation of the G8 summit. Our thoughts in this tragic situation go first and foremost to the victims and their families. The British population have our deepest sympathies.The Norwegian King Harald telexed Queen Elisabeth II: It was with great sorrow I received the shocking news about the horrible incidents that happened in London this morning, that have injured and claimed the lives of innocent humans" Prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik urges that the war on terror have to continue: "We cannot let ourself get scared, that would be to give the terrorists the victory.Support for Great Britain came from the President of Serbia and the Prime Minister of Kosovo. The President of Serbia and Montenegro, Svetozar Marović, sent his condolences to Queen Elizabeth II and Tony Blair, and expressed solidarity of citizens of Serbia and Montenegro with the British people: We are stunned by this tragedy and new recklessness of terrorists towards free and civilized countries and their citizens. Innocent victims in London will only strenghten the struggle of the entire human kind against terrorism.At least seven people were killed in the United States yesterday, when a World War II-era bomber crashed at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The plane crashed near the end of a runway at 9:54 a.m. ET (1354 UTC) during an attempted landing, and struck a deicing facility at the airport, according to officials. The pilot was trying to land the plane about five minutes after takeoff. Fourteen people were injured in the crash, including all on board the plane, and one airport worker on the ground, according to Commissioner James Rovella of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.According to Windsor Locks' first selectman, Chris Kervick, there were ten passengers and three crew members aboard the aircraft. Crash victims were transported by ambulance and by air to hospitals in the area, including Hartford Hospital, Bridgeport Hospital, and Saint Francis Hospital.Dr. Steven Wolf at Saint Francis said, "We received a mass casualty alert following the plane crash that took place near Bradley International Airport this morning. As a Level 1 Trauma Center, Saint Francis Hospital department has deployed all the necessary preparations in order to be ready to receive any number of patients."Bradley Airport was shut down after the incident and reopened later that day at 2 p.m. ET (1800 UTC). The airport is the second-largest airport in the New England region of northeastern United States.Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said at a press conference after the incident, "My heart really goes out to the families and we're going to give them the best information we can, as soon as we can, in an honest way [...] We're doing everything we can, and we've got an amazing group of people who are going to get to the bottom of this as soon as we can. You're in our prayers."The aircraft, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, is registered in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and was manufactured in 1944 according to Federal Aviation Administration records. According to a 1989 report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the same aircraft was involved in an incident in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania on August 23, 1987. The report said there was one passenger seriously injured, and two more with minor injuries; no crew were injured.According to Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, the involved airplane is one of eighteen B-17s still in the United States. Blumenthal said the NTSB would begin an investigation at Bradley Airport, led by Board Member Jennifer Homendy.A shipment of humanitarian aid from the Italian government was delivered to Tbilisi, the capital of flood ravaged Georgia on Tuesday. Norway and the United States sent tents, clothes, food and generators for electricity. German and Latvian aid is expected soon.  In the eastern region of Kakheti, several villages of the Lagodekhi district were flooded after the Kabali river burst its bank Tuesday night. No casualties were reported.Torrential rains lasting nearly a week combined with snow-melt to create in the worst floods in 20 years in the Caucasus republic. A third of the country is effected, mostly in the western portion, with damage reported to buildings, homes and many roads. Over 1000 people were forced to evacuate.  Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Nogaideli called for an assessment of the flood and mudslide damages. Amendments to the 2005 budget are foreseen in the range of 20 million Lari to cover disaster relief efforts.Up to eight people may have died after Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia experienced its worst storm in thirty years. NSW Premier Morris Iemma made the declaration at 9.30pm on the 8th June, as people waded through waist-deep water in the centre of the city. Authorities have had to call off the search for a family of five, who were lost when the Old Pacific Highway sank into a thirty-metre deep chasm underneath them. The bodies of an adult and two children were found in the car this morning.Police are also looking for an elderly couple missing in the Hunter Valley, and a Newcastle man who was swept down a storm water drain in the northern part of the city. Authorities also fear a "potentially major environmental disaster", as bulk carrier Pasha Bulker is grounded on a reef in Nobby's Beach. The vessel contains over 700 tonnes of fuel and shows some signs of breaking up. Twenty-two crew members were rescued earlier in the day. Two other vessels, the Sea Confidence and the Betis required assistance from tugs with the Sea Confidence coming within 700m of the shore.The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has issued further flooding and severe weather warnings; they expect the weather to continue overnight easing during Sunday for the area.The wreck of the plane ATR72 that fell into the sea near Sicily, Italy on August 6 has been recovered. One of the two black boxes that contained the communication recording, and the complete set of instruments and commands in the cockpit, was recovered.One of the three people who were still missing from the accident was found, while there is yet no sign of the other two persons. The identity of the recovered corpse is not yet known (and the identification is expected to be difficult).A survey published today by the Italian association Intesaconsumatori (Union of Consumers) said that 61% of Italians are afraid to fly, while 41% of population feels less safe about plane safety than they did one month earlier. According to the survey, 20% would be ready to get off the plane, or refuse to get in the plane, if they found that the airline is different from the one they were told when they bought the ticket.The wreckage of an aircraft carrying eleven mining executives from Australia has been found in Cameroon, according to the country's information minister.According to the official, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, either nine or ten bodies have been recovered from the aircraft, which was reported missing on Saturday and apparently crashed in the Congo.  Bakary said that "[t]he wreckage has been found in Congo. Unfortunately there were no survivors."The plane, a Casa C212, was traveling from Cameroon to Congo, where Sundance Resources, an Australian mining company whose entire board of directors was on the plane, is trying to develop an iron ore mine. Contact with the plane was lost around an hour after it took off.In addition to six Australians, including one of the country's richest men, Ken Talbot, there were two British, two French, and one US citizen on board the plane. The search for the downed plane had involved Cameroon, Australia, the United States, and Canada, and had included four aircraft, although operations had been disrupted by fog.Sundance said that they had halted all African operations in the wake of the crash, which led to the cessation of trading the company's shares and the appointment of an acting CEO, the firm's Chief Financial Officer Peter Canterbury.  Another Sundance official said that although significant, the crash would not "mortally wound" the company.A gas tanker which crashed onto a preserved railway line in Wolsingham, County Durham in the north of England has been removed. Yesterday, the vehicle fell 70 feet from a road bridge onto the Weardale Railway below and left the driver with serious injuries from which he later died in hospital.The driver of the Calor Gas vehicle has been named as Peter Williams who was 25 and from the Darlington area.The tanker was said to be carrying 13,000 litres of liquefied petroleum gas at the time of the accident and nearby homes were evacuated due to fears the gas may leak from the vehicle. Chris Hockaday, from County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service, described the operation to empty the tanker of gas and remove it from the scene: "The decanting finished at about 10pm and the tanker was then dragged along the track by a tractor, where it was lifted onto another vehicle by the specialist recovery company. It was then moved to a secure site for examination. The authorities left the scene at about midnight. Before decanting the gas, we had to right the vehicle, something which had to be done under great control in an operation which took about two hours."The Weardale Railway, which operates over a five mile section of restored track between Stanhope and Wolsingham, remains closed, but the company were optimistic about resuming services on the line.Managing director of the Weardale Railway, Steve Raine, said "The tanker was moved late last night so we haven't yet been able to properly examine the track. However, the damage appears to be quite light, and we're hoping we can get that fixed today." He said that services were most likely to resume this Saturday.The latest information on the Kenya Airways information website states, "Kenya Airways regrets to confirm that its Flight KQ 507 from Douala to Nairobi has been located on a mangrove swamp, 20 km southeast of Douala, on the planned flight path." The website also indicates that search and rescue operations have been initiated. There are no survivors.Flight KQ 507 had 8 crew members, 106 passengers and a flight engineer on board, and was traveling from Abidjan to Nairobi. It made a stopover in Douala, Cameroon where more passengers got on the plane before it continued on its flight. The plane sent a distress signal at 2:00 a.m., just after it took off from Cameroon, but it is not known what triggered the distress signal. The plane was supposed to land at 6:15 a.m. local time, but never arrived. It left Abidjan at 11:05 p.m. local time in Nairobi."All I can say for now is that the wreckage of the plane has been located in the small village of Mbanga Pongo, in the Douala III subdivision. Access to the area is very difficult. We are beginning a new painful phase. Our task will be more difficult now, the task of recovering the corpses," said Hamidou Yaya Marafa, Cameroon's Minister of State for Territorial Administration, during a press conference.So far only small portions of the plane have been found, as much of the plane is reported to be underwater."The plane fell head first. Its nose was buried in the mangrove swamp," said chief of meteorology for the Douala airport, Thomas Sobakam.Reports say that many of the remains of the individuals on board the plane are dismembered and when rescuers attempt to recover the remains, they fall apart in their hands."It's devastating. I found one or two whole bodies at the start, but since then everything is in pieces. People were afraid of the bodies at the start, so I had to pick them up with my own hands, and they came apart in my fingers," said Captain of Cameroon's fire department, Francis Ekosso.There were passengers from 26 different countries on the plane, not including the 9 crew members from Kenya (see list below). Kenya Airways has released the names of all passengers on board Flight KQ 507 (see external links below).The area where the plane went down is reported to be thick with forest, and difficult to reach. Local Fisherman are said to have lead rescuers to the crash site after they heard a "boom" and saw "disturbances in the water.""We are told the aircraft was covered by a canopy of trees, and that was the delay in sighting the crash site. The mangrove area is a very tricky area, access is very difficult. I think they will use trekking and boats," added Marafa.Earlier the chief meteorologist for the airport in Douala, Cameroon, Thomas Sobakam said that "signs" of Flight KQ 507 were located, but also said that what was located was not wreckage. Sabakam also said that the reports that wreckage had been found were "premature."The cause of the crash is under investigation, but officials say the plane took off in bad weather and are looking into whether engine failure played a role or not. At least one black box from the plane has been found, but its not known if it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.The next scheduled press briefing will be on Monday, May 7 at 10:00 a.m. local time.According to the Brazilian air force, Brazilian military aircraft have found wreckage of an airplane in the Atlantic Ocean, about 650 kilometres off the northern coast of Brazil.The wreckage is suspected to have come from Air France Flight 447, a passenger jet that went missing over the Atlantic Ocean on June 1.The debris includes airplane seats and metallic objects. Pilots from TAM, a Brazilian airline had earlier said they saw what they perceived to be a fire in the Atlantic, but French officials say that no sign of wreckage had been found.Brazilian airplanes with sensors are currently scanning the area of the ocean where the debris was found."A TAM airlines plane from Brazil supposedly saw something on fire in the Atlantic Ocean. This was an aeroplane that landed today," said Jose Alencar, the Brazilian vice president.Air France Flight AF447 was an Airbus A330 carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members that disappeared after it went into a severe thunderstorm. Authorities are not yet certain what caused the incident, but are pessimistic as to whether any survivors will be found.After an exhaustive two year, 20 million euro ($28 million) search, the final resting spot of Air France Flight 447 has been located. The location of the wreckage is six miles north of the plane's last reported position off the coast of Brazil at a depth of 3,800 and 4,000 meters (2,070 to 2,190 fathoms or 12,467 feet and 13,123 feet).The wreckage of the Airbus A330-200, was found Sunday by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, using a Remus robotic submarine and its side-scan sonar. After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage.Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, France's Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea, confirmed to reporters: "Bodies were found. They will be recovered and identified.""We weren’t prepared for that. We are now confronted with another trauma," Robert Soulas, vice president of Entraide et Solidarité AF447, a support group for families of victims of the crash, said. Soulas lost his daughter and son-in-law, who were on board the flight when it crashed. "For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."The remains of the plane, which were concentrated in a 600 metres by 200 metres (1,968 feet by 656 feet) area, appear to be relatively intact which leads investigators to believe that the plane hit the water intact and did not explode mid-air. Around 50 bodies of the 228 passengers and crew on board and parts of the plane were found shortly after the crash in 2009.According to Jean-Paul Troadec, the head of France's Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the accident investigation body for aircraft overseeing the operation and investigation, the wreckage and bodies will be bought to surface and then sent to France for investigation. The salvage operation, which will cost around 5 million euros ($7.1 million) according to estimates, will be financed by the French government. Three salvage companies who are bidding to recover the wreck have until afternoon on Thursday to submit proposals. The operation should take between three weeks to a month.On raising the remains of the plane Troadec said: "We want to know what happened in this accident, most particularly so it never happens again." Some family members agreed saying such as Michael Gaignard, whose sister was on board the plane said, "We want to know what happened in that plane." An attorney for several families said some had yet to come to terms with loss of loved ones, saying "There's been no burial, no goodbye ... just lots and lots of suffering."Soulas of Entraide et Solidarité AF447 disagreed. "There's a very traumatic side to this and it causes problems of identification. We don't know what state they are in." He added, "And it risks causing a dispute between families who want to leave the bodies at the bottom of the Atlantic and those who want them brought to the surface."However, despite the discovery of the wreckage, the plane's two flight recorders, the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) have yet to be found at the crash site.Alain Bouillard, who is in charge of BEA's recovery effort said, "It's still a jigsaw puzzle. We do not know where the recorders might be."There are concerns that the two-year length the recorders have been submerged in seawater along with enormous pressure located at the depth of the wreck, that the data on the recorders might be unreadable. Bouillard said it is possible the recorders were damaged, but had "great confidence" in their robustness.Without the recovery of the recorders, investigators may be unable to determine the cause of the crash. The leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's pitot tubes, devices which measure how fast the aircraft is travelling. Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash.The plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down.According to Chinese state media Xinhua, a ship carrying a hazardous cargo has sunk into the Yangtze river. The vessel took its cargo of 100 tonnes of highly corrosive hydrochloric acid down with it after colliding with another vessel today.The report cited an official with the Hubei Provincial Environmental Protection Department as saying "We are paying close attention to the water quality in this area," and that acidity is currently normal. The collision, attributed to strong winds, occurred in Jiangxi Province, where the stricken ship was registered.The crew have been rescued and authorities say they have located the chemicals and are working to recover them. That process is expected to be completed early on Monday, according to Xinhua.According to reports, a Yemenia Airways Airbus A310 passenger jet has crashed into the Indian Ocean near the island nation of Comoros. At least 153 people were onboard the aircraft, 66 of them from Paris, France. So far the only reported survivor is a teenage girl. The plane crashed early Tuesday morning.Yemenia Airways Flight 626 was traveling from Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, to Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport in Comoros.Comoros lies nearly 200 miles from mainland Africa. The small, three island nation has a population of just under 800,000 with a combined military and police force of around 1,000. Comoros has no navy, leaving it with little to no sea rescue resources."We really have no sea rescue capabilities," said an unnamed police official.The cause of the crash has not yet been determined.A Pakistani boy got his older sister to hang him in the same manner as Saddam Hussein.Mubashar Ali, 9, hanged himself, while re-enacting Hussein's hanging with the help of elder sister, 10, after tying a rope to a ceiling fan and his neck in his home in the Punjab district of Rahimyar Khan on Sunday, said a local police official. The father of the deceased boy said that his children had been watching the video of Saddam Hussein's execution on television and attempted to imitate the hanging as other family members thought they were playing in another room. "My wife and sister rushed to rescue Mubashar when children cried for help from the adjoining room, but he died due to hanging," said Alamgir Paracha, father of Mubashar. Police said that the death was accidental and a case of parental negligence. "It was an accident which happened due to carelessness of parents," said district police chief Sultan Ahmad.Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after being involved in a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

Bennett was 60 years old. His death was confirmed Thursday by some of his friends and family members. The helicopter, a Bell UH-1 Iroquois, went down after darkness had fallen.
