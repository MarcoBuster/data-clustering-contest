While the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games may be hard at work, constructing stadiums, building roads, and launching the event's mascots, a third of Canada remains oblivious.When polled by Decima Research, 34% of Canadians could not name the location of the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games.Sam Sullivan, mayor of Vancouver, was asked by CTV whether he was concerned with the results of the poll, commissioned by the federal government. He remained confident of their abilities as an international host, saying the Games will bring "us together as a country."Pollsters accepted either Vancouver or Whistler as correct answers. In the host province, British Columbia, all but 3% were aware. But other major provinces didn't fare so well. Only 68% of Albertans and 60% of Ontario residents knew. Quebec remained the least aware, with only 43% giving a correct answer.Only 2 in 5 Canadians think the Olympics will positively affect those facing social issues. That question fared even worse in B.C., where just 29% agree.American professional wrestler "Dr Death" Steve Williams has died aged 49. The retired wrestler died of cancer.

After table tennis and soccer, events from martial arts including karate, judo, and taekwondo were featured mainly in the 2nd matchday. Unlike the taekwondo event which applied a single elimination rule, events from karate and judo applied round robin rules in their competitions."Invitational Games for the Deaf, Taipei 2008", a large sporting event which takes place as part of the build up to the 2009 Summer Deaflympics, was launched today in Taipei, Taiwan.The invitation games features several sports including table tennis, soccer, judo, karate, and taekwondo.

Paul the Octopus, who lives in an aquarium in Oberhausen, in western Germany, has so far correctly forecast who will win every World Cup game involving the German side. Paul also predicted that the German team will beat Uruguay in Saturday's match for third place.The octopus has become something of a celebrity during the World Cup, as all six of his predictions for Germany's World Cup games proved accurate.  His final prediction, for Sunday's final between Spain and the Netherlands, was broadcast live on television.  The eight-legged sea creature was given two boxes to choose from — one marked with a flag from the Netherlands and another with the flag of Spain.  In the end it was the Spanish flag he went for.Rupert Adams of William Hill, one of Britain's largest bookmakers, said that the octopus's success rate is remarkable."If you had had ten pounds on each and every prediction then re-invested your winnings you would currently have over 1,450 pounds," said Adams.  "It's an astonishing feat to get six predictions in a row.  I am told people are walking into our shops and saying 'I will have what the Octopus predicted.'"But David Spiegelhalter, Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, was less convinced of the animal's abilities, pointing out that many other creatures failed to predict the correct outcomes of matches and went unreported."It's like seeing footage of a golfer getting a hole-in-one," Spiegelhalter said. "We're not seeing the millions of times the golfer made the shot and it didn't go in."At least one other animal has weighed in on the World Cup final. Mani, a 13 year old parakeet from Singapore, allegedly correctly predicted the results of the four quarter-final matches, and also Spain's semi-final victory over Germany. The parakeet apparently thinks that the Netherlands will defeat Spain in the final.Which of the supposed oracles is correct remains to be seen. The final takes place on Sunday in Johannesburg, South Africa.Asafa Powell has broken the world 100 metre record at the IAAF Grand Prix Rieti. The Jamaican set the record of 9.74 seconds in one of two heats, after setting the previous record in Athens in June 2005, and meeting it twice in Gateshead and Zurich. The race took place under a strong following wind, but still within International Association of Athletics Federations standards. Speaking about the heat, Powell said 'It's just to remind my fans that Asafa Powell is still here. I came here and executed properly and did what I was supposed to do.' Powell was followed by Michael Frater, also Jamaican, who came second, and Norway's Jaysuma Saidy Ndure. They ran 10.03 seconds and 10.10 seconds respectively. Powell recently gained a bronze medal at the World Championships, after admitting he had given up during the final when he realised he was out of gold medal contention. It was a major disappointment for Powell, who has never scored a world title despite breaking the record four times.Catherine Ndereba won her fourth Boston marathon yesterday, making her the first woman to do so. The Kenyan trailed for the first 20 miles of the race, before passing Elfenesh Alemu at the top of Heartbreak Hill in Newton. Though the 26.2 mile race takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, it has been dominated by Kenyan and Ethiopian runners for approximately the last ten years. Emily Levan of Wiscasset, Maine, was the first American woman to finish, placing twelfth in 2:43:14. Levan was also 12th in the 2003 Boston Marathon.Ethiopian Hailu Negussie won the men's race in 2:11:45.

The Paralympic team is expected to finish the Games having earned the country's one thousandth medal.The 131st run for the roses in Louisville, KY is set for Saturday at Churchill Downs. Post time is 6:04pm EDT under what should be partly sunny skies and a fast track. The 20-horse field contains 10 strong contenders in what promises to be a fast pace out front in the Kentucky Derby.Trainer Nick Zito, the 2-time derby winner boasts 5 stable horses running the race, and has the odds-on favorite Bellamy Road. The George Steinbrenner owned horse won convincingly in  4 of its last 5 trips.  At its #16 post position, it will have to get out quickly, or be on the outside going into the first turn where it would have to fight for position. Given the early starting speed of Spanish Chestnut, it seems unlikely that any horse will easily set the pace.Showing strong closing in its last 4 races is Bandini, ridden by top New York jockey John Velazquez, a 6-time Breeder's Cup winner. If this horse can hold onto the pace, watch for him at the finish line.For today's 1 ¼ mile race, Jeremy Rose on Afleet Alex looks dangerous, where both horse and jockey are  experienced. But it was Wilko who prevailed in their meeting at the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last October.A Chicago Tribune computer analysis predicts a win for High Fly, based on its “lack of flaws”.  In that prediction they note criteria on which it was calculated, but nothing accounts for the race day excitement of roaring crowds in these 3-year-old thoroughbreds.Last year the jammed Churchill Downs drew 140,000 people on a rainy Saturday to watch Smarty Jones win. The Derby run is the first leg in USA horse racing's Triple Crown. The last horse to win the triple crown was Affirmed in 1978.AUCKLAND —This event saw an emergence of the Pacific Island nations into the Commonwealth Judo community. For many years only Fiji's Nacanieli Takayawa was apparent on the international scene. Although not taking many medals, the efforts going into development in nations such as Tonga allowed many of their players to place 5th or 7th. India also performed well, especially their women's team.2004 Commonwealth Judo Championships13-14 November 2004, Auckland, New ZealandMens -60 kgChana, Navjot (IND)Smith, Tom (ENG)Boore, Stephen (WAL)Leat, Alister (NZL)Mens -66 kgCarder, Gareth (ENG)Pilley, Ben (NZL)Ovtchinnikov, Anton (NZL)Singh, Bhupinder (IND)Mens -73 kgEwers, Craig (WAL)Broom, Peter (NZL)Reed, Tom (ENG)Reid, Lyndsay (NZL)Mens -81 kgCousins, Thomas (ENG)Preston, Luke (WAL)Endicott-Davies, Morgan (AUS)Solanki, Vinod (IND)Mens -90 kgCousins, Peter (ENG)O Connor, Mark (WAL)Dill-Russell, Ryan (NZL)Dill-Russell, David (NZL)Mens -100 kgKelly, Martin (AUS)Pragnell, Andrew (NZL)Koster, Jason (NZL)Mens +100 kgTakayawa, Nacanieli (FIJ)Mens OpenCousins, Peter (ENG)Pragnell, Andrew (NZL)Fakaosi, Epoki (TGA)O Connor, Mark (WAL)Women's -48 kgArchbold, Lisa (NZL)Archana, (IND)Chanu, Ningthoujam Gomti (IND)Women's -52 kgChanu, Angom Anita (IND)Welsh, Elizabeth (ENG)Fong, Kelly (AUS)Women's -57 kgJohnstone, Sophie (ENG)Devi, Laishram Nirupama (IND)Stormont, Vicky (NZL)Taylor, Sharon (AUS)Women's -63 kgHutchins, Gemma (ENG)Newham, Allison (AUS)Kaur, Pawan Deep (IND)Women's -70 kgHolt, Michelle (ENG)Williams, Joy (NZL)Women's -78 kgWilson, Sian (ENG)Bittu, (IND)Women's +78 kgIredale, Fiona (NZL)Diviya, (IND)Women's OpenWilson, Sian (ENG)Williams, Joy (NZL)Healy, Shauna (NIR)The fifteenth Mediterranean Games, held in Almería, Spain were closed yesterday.

The annual women's invitational, held in the Algarve region of Portugal, features some of the world's top teams and may foreshadow face-offs in the 2007 Women's World Cup.  The United States women's national soccer team, champions in four of the last six Algarve Cups and second ranked in the world, will join the number one ranked Germany at this year's competition.  The three "groups" of four teams who will play each other at the beginning of the tournament have yet to be finalized.  However, it's been reported that the U.S. will be in a group with France, Denmark and China.  The U.S. recently beaten China and tied France to win the 2006 Four Nations Tournament.  Teams with the luxury of being full-time players (some women professional athletes must keep regular jobs) will take a break from training before they begin arriving in Algarve next week.The XVIIIth Commonwealth Games were opened officially by Queen Elizabeth II tonight, in Melbourne, Australia in a two-and-a-half hour spectacular Opening Ceremony held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. About 80,000 spectators were in attendance, and hundreds of thousands lined the riverbank of the nearby Yarra River, watching as the Queen's baton made its way to the stadium. The Queen's Baton final runner was John Landy, the current Governor of Victoria, and a Bronze medalist in the 1956 Summer Olympics.The ceremony began with the flags of Australia, England, (previous host) and India, (next host) being raised.In a change from the traditional format, the teams did not enter in alphabetical order; instead, they entered in order of regions of the Commonwealth, starting with the European nations. Then Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Caribbean and finally Oceania entered the stadium.Melbourne funk band The Cat Empire provided musical accompaniment as the athletes marched into the arena, playing music specifically written for each continent.The Queen, dressed in gold and accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, received the baton, which has travelled to all 71 competing nations, where she read the message placed within the baton (366 days earlier on Commonwealth Day, March 14, 2005).The Queen's said "I am glad to have this opportunity to offer my best wishes to every athlete and official taking part in these friendly Games .... It now gives me the greatest pleasure to declare the 18th Commonwealth Games open."The Queen, who is 80 next month (21 April), was taken aback when the audience joined in a tribute of Happy Birthday, ending with eight bars from God Save the Queen, led by New Zealand opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.4,500 athletes representing 71 teams from 53 Commonwealth countries will be competing at the games this year.

Gordon2 Luke McShane3 Nigel Short4 Sarunas Sulskis5 Simon K WilliamsThe 2006 Formula One season has started with the 57 lap Grand Prix of Bahrain on the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir. It is the first time since Melbourne winning the Australian GP from Adelaide in 1996 that the opening race of the season has not been held in Australia. The date was changed to avoid conflicts with the 2006 Commonwealth Games. It is the third grand prix that has been raced at Bahrain, since it was completed in 2004. Last year's race was won by Fernando Alonso of the Renault F1 Team, who went on to win the championship.This year the results were as follows:The 20th Olympic Winter Games are set to start today in Turin, Italy.Producers of the Olympics have promised, "rhythm, passion and speed," as an estimated 35,000 people will pile inside the stadium and nearly two billion will turn out for the events.Dancers, abutting the majestic Alps, paid a tribute to seven nations, including Austria, Germany and France, in the opening ceremonies wearing green sheaths and pulling fake cows on wheels. It was to pay homage to livestock and mountain life, and so the audience could cheer both, everyone was supplied with cowbells. Dancers then brought out big white bubbles which were stuck to their heads. Bacilli, who has performed in concerts for U2 and The Rolling Stones said the balls signify snow.Eight women, Italian actress Sophia Loren, Chilean writer Isabel Allende, American actress Susan Sarandon, Nobel Peace-prize winner Wangari Maathai of Kenya, and three Olympic medal winners carried the Olympic flag.  This was the first time ever that only women carried the flag.At least 6,100 volunteers who worked an estimated 10,000 hours helped to organize and run the ceremonies.Unfortunately, in the hours before the games were to start, eight cross-country skiers, a former gold medalist from Germany, and two Americans, were suspended for five days each after they failed blood tests. The tests say that they had elevated levels of hemoglobin, an enzyme within red blood cells that can increase endurance. However, the positives results could be due to the body's acclimation to mountain air, or dehydration. The American skiers are Kikkan Randall of Anchorage Alaska, and Leif Zimmermann of Bozeman, Montana.Casey Stoner, Australia's new MotoGP world champion, won the Australian Grand Prix on Phillip Island, Victoria, in the afternoon of October 14.

Craig McMillan hit a quick-fire 25, but just one ball after hitting a huge maximum he missed the ball, resulting in him being bowled out by Sanath Jayasuriya. Bond fell soon after for Muralitharan's 4th wicket, leaving New Zealand on the brink of being eliminated from the competition. Franklin and Patel rebuilt and reached their 50 partnership in just 55 balls - which is a new record for a 10th wicket partnership for this World Cup - but Patel succumbed to trying to slog Dilshan over midwicket, but falling short and being caught by Fernando to finish New Zealand's resistance.

This confirms South Africa's place in one of the four Semi-Final places in the tournament, and eliminates both England and hosts West Indies.After losing both opening batsmen in quick succession, with Pietersen falling soon after, England were looking to rebuild steadily with Strauss and Collingwood at the crease. After hitting their 50-partnership in 80 balls, both men fell one after another inside 2 overs.Flintoff was quickly dispatched by a reverse-swinging delivery from Andrew Hall that went in between bat and body to take out the top of middle-stump. Two overs later and Nixon fell for 1 on the last ball of the 36th over, followed by Mahmood being bowled on the first delivery of Hall's next over leaving him on a hat-trick, which he narrowly missed achieving after a wild swing by Monty Panesar just missed the ball, but went on to fly in to wicket-keeper Boucher's hands.Boucher caught Panesar off of the bowling of Nel following a poor shot, and Hall went on to bowl Anderson out to get his first ODI five-wicket haul (taking the wickets of Collingwood, Flintoff, Nixon, Mahmood and Anderson), the third of the competition (after fellow South Africans Charl Langeveldt's against Sri Lanka and Andre Nel's against Bangladesh), to finish with figures of 5-18 (10) - the best by a South African in a World Cup, beating Lance Klusener's 5-21 against Kenya in 1999. Andrew Strauss top scored for England with 46 and Bopara added precious runs at the tail end of England's innings with 27*, in a similar fashion to his 52 against Sri Lanka.South Africa started batting in emphatic fashion: reaching 50 in just 5.4 overs: in contrast, England had taken 15.1 overs to reach 50; and while de Villiers was lucky not to be out on just 21 after being caught behind by Nixon off of the bowling of Anderson, (it was an edge so faint that the umpire, Steve Bucknor, couldn't hear it and couldn't give it), South Africa kept the foot on the gas and even after losing de Villiers on 42 they kept the run rate around 8, resulting in Smith getting 50 off of just 34 deliveries with only 9 dot balls, finishing on 85*. Kallis got to 17*, including getting his 9000th ODI run - a feat only 10 players have achieved.Toss: England won, and elected to bat first.Fall of wickets: 1-9 (Bell, 7.3 ov), 2-37 (Vaughan, 12.2 ov), 3-53 (Pietersen, 16.2 ov), 4-111 (Strauss, 32.4 ov), 5-115 (Collingwood, 33.5 ov), 6-119 (Flintoff, 35.1 ov), 7-121 (Nixon, 36.0 ov), 8-121 (Mahmood, 37.1 ov), 9-144 (Panesar, 44.3 ov), 10-154 (Anderson, 48.0 ov)Fall of wickets: 1-85 (de Villiers, 9.5 ov)Did not bat: Herschelle Gibbs, Ashwell Prince, Mark Boucher, Justin Kemp, Shaun Pollock, Andrew Hall, Andre Nel, Charl LangeveldtEngland: I R Bell, M P Vaughan (capt), A J Strauss, K P Pietersen, P D Collingwood, A Flintoff, R S Bopara, P A Nixon (wkt), S I Mahmood, J M Anderson, M S PanesarSouth Africa: G C Smith (capt), A B de Villiers, J D Kallis, H H Gibbs, A G Prince, M V Boucher (wkt), J M Kemp, S M Pollock, A J Hall, A Nel, C K LangeveldtPlayer of the match: A J Hall (South Africa)Umpires: S A Bucknor (West Indies) and S J A Taufel (Australia)TV umpire: B F Bowden (New Zealand)Match referee: R S Madugalle (Sri Lanka)Reserve umpire: R E Koertzen (South Africa)England have defeated the West Indies in the final game of the Super 8 phase of the World Cup at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados. The result decided little: England finished 5th in the Super 8s table, with the West Indies coming 6th.The end of the match was tight with the result tipping in the balance for the last 5 overs. With just 3 overs left England needed 29 runs - looking unlikely to win the match, but Paul Nixon stepped up and hit 13 off the next over, with another 4 coming from extras, to turn the match round; giving England the upper hand. Despite being bowled out by Dwayne Bravo - who had earlier been involved in the dismissal of 4 other English batsmen (two from run outs, two from bowling and taking one catch) - tail enders Anderson and Broad gave England a tight 1 wicket win with just 1 ball remaining.This was the last appearance for West Indies captain Brian Lara in international cricket: he has now retired from both Test and ODI cricket.

The race, which was to be the 30th consecutive rally, was to start in Lisbon, Portugal and end on January 20 in Dakar, Senegal having crossed the Sahara Desert.The endurance event is the world’s biggest off-road rally and Paris-based organisers Amaury Sport Organisation had said as late as Thursday that more than 500 cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads from fifty different countries were ready to go as scheduled. However, the organisation changed its mind under pressure from the French government.Al-Qaida-linked groups are believed to have planned to attack the rally, and it is reported that specific threats were made against it by al-Qaida in the Islamic Magreb, a regional African offshoot. The day before Christmas a French family on holiday in Mauritania was murdered and al-Qaida are believed to be responsible; the rally was scheduled to spend eight days in Mauritania.Al-Qaida in the Islamic Magreb have recently seen a crackdown by authorities, but are continuing their operations and are now seeking to strike international targets. Last month they bombed the United Nations headquarters in Algiers; that attack killed 37.The Mauritanian government had promised a 3,000-strong security force to protect the competitors but the remote location of the desert and scrubland involved would make effective security arrangements almost impossible. French security consultant Louis Caprioli, former anti-terrorism head at the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire, said “You would need really incredible security precautions, and I don’t think it’s possible with the new techniques of attack, such as suicide bombings.”French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said yesterday that Amuary had been warned by government officials that it would be too dangerous to go ahead with the plan. After last-minute meetings with ministry officials. “No other decision but the cancellation of the sporting event could be taken,” said a statement on Amuary’s website.Caprioli said the terrorists intended to prove “They can chase out the infidels. The cancellation was wise. But it gives the impression that the terrorists have won.”Patrice Clerc, head of Amuary, stated “When you are told of direct threats against the event and when the sinister name of al-Qaeda is mentioned, you don’t ask for details. It was enough for me to hear my government say the danger is at a maximum.”Security has caused many concerns for the race over the years. Extremists tend to view the race as a prime target, as it is highly covered by the media, and is a rare concentration of Westerners. As a result, major security measures have had to be undertaken by French and African authorities. Almost 50 people have been killed, several of whom at the hands of African fighters. Although there are fears for the future of the race, Amuary said that the event would continue in the future. “The Dakar is a symbol, and nothing can destroy symbols,” they said. “The cancellation of the 2008 edition does not endanger the future of the Dakar.” However, they have confirmed that it is unlikely Mauritania will be a destination in future events. Competitors in the event, however, are less optimistic, with many saying that they feel the race will not go ahead next year. Newspapers in Senegal have described the cancellation as a death sentence. Meanwhile, the town of Portimao in Portugal, intended to be the rally’s first scheduled stop, are considering filing for damages against Amuary.Victor Anderes, vice-president of a New York firm specialising in high-profile event security, called the cancellation an unprecedented one in sporting history, saying “Smaller cultural events have been cancelled , but this hasn’t happened with such a major international event.” However, he did accept that “The threat is significant. It would be almost impossible to secure the entire course.”This year's Leisure Taiwan trade show (a.k.a Taiwan Sport Recreation and Leisure Show) started yesterday, with 131 companies participating including sports media companies such as ESPN and VideoLand Television, businesses selling sports equipment and fitness clubs.

And also, he commented about an "earlier suspension" incident in the same stage in 2007: "I didn't participate in this series last year. However, with several cyclists' actual strengths in several criterium stages, I think that the same incident won't take place again this year."In the main race, due to a very close actual strength, not everyone can took the leading for a long-period especially in Asian cyclists' competition.

I really appreciated and thanked for my teammates' help."Prior to the main race of 2008 Tour de Taiwan, the 2008 Taipei Cycle (Taipei International Cycle Show, located at TWTC Nangang) and TaiSPO (Taipei International Sporting Goods show, located at Taipei World Trade Center Hall 1) will not only exhibit from next Tuesday to Sunday (March 13-16) but it will also bring multiple opportunities for sporting goods, athletic sports, bicycle, and MICE (meeting, incentive, convention, and exhibition) industries after the TWTC Nangang stage was firmly included into 2008 Tour de Taiwan and its race will be start next Saturday (March 15).British football clubs Manchester United and Chelsea today competed in the first ever Champions League final containing only English clubs. The UEFA Champions League is a large European football tournament, where the highest ranked teams from many countries compete. Manchester United won 6-5 on penalties. The match started off slowly, with the first goal being scored by Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United. The goal was scored at 19:11 UTC.Claude Makelele and Paul Scholes were both given yellow cards in the 22nd minute due to a collision in air which resulted in Scholes receiving treatment for a small injury.A goal scored just before half time, by Frank Lampard, put both sides at an equal position for the start of the second half. The goal was scored from a free kick which was taken as a result of a foul by Rio Ferdinand in the 44th minute. Ferdinand got a yellow card as a result of the incident. In the first few minutes of the second half, Manchester United  were awarded a free kick due to a foul by Ballack, which resulted Ronaldo falling to the ground.At the mid point in the second half a BBC commentator predicted that changes would be made to the Manchester squad. "Fergie [Alex Ferguson, Manchester United manager] remains impassive on the United bench, but surely he can't leave it too much longer before making a change? His team are being over-powered at present," he said.Drogba aimed to give Chelsea a lead with a shot in the 79th minute, which hit the left hand post.A late substitution resulted in Paul Scholes being taken off and Ryan Giggs being brought on for Manchester United,Vancouver Whitecaps lost their 2nd game of the season after losing 2-0 to Seattle Sounders on last night.Seattle effectively took control of the Interstate 5 derby after early goals from Josh Gardner and Sebastien Le Toux.Whitecaps fans were left in shock after only 7 minutes, as Seattle "blitzed" the home-side with two quick goals in the opening exchanges.It took just 3 minutes for the Sounders to score the opening goal, as Gardner got on the end of a Le Toux through ball before hitting the shot past a diving Whitecaps goalkeeper Srdjan Djekanovic to give the Seattle the lead.Seattle extended their lead through the reigning Player of the Year in Le Toux on 7th minutes with a right-footed shot that went past the diving Whitecaps goalkeeper Srdjan Djekanovic.Whitecaps centre back Omar Jarun underlined the disappointment of his team's start. "The first few minutes were an absolute disaster from us defensively," he told whitecapsfc.com. "We came out flat, and that's disappointing because everything we put into this game in terms of preparation went to waste. It's hard to keep the team's head up after something like that. But tomorrow is another day, and hopefully we can put this defeat out of the way in Portland. Like Seattle, they are another good team, and if do not come out ready to play, it will be another nightmare."Schmetzer was naturally delighted with the way his side claimed an important away victory in Vancouver. "I think we played well," he said. "When you get a couple of early goals, you are in control of the game. With both goals, we were able to dictate the pace of the game."The 1st half ended with jeers from the home crowd.A host of substitutions ensued early in the 2nd half, with Arze, Justin Moose, and Jason Jordan all replacing Valente, Donatelli, and Addlery, as Vancouver tried to bring some spark to what had been a below-par Whitecaps performance.There was also a Whitecaps debut for new signing Chris Pozniak, as he replaced centre back Omar Jarun on the hour mark. "Give credit to Seattle tonight," Pozniak said of the defeat. "They were the better team over the 90 minutes. They are so well organized, and I tried to speed up the play when I came in, but it didn't work. With the game tomorrow night, it might better for us mentally to get another crack at playing and show that we are better than the performance tonight."As the match entered the five minutes of time added on, a deflected shot from Pozniak was the extent of Vancouver's efforts to pull a goal back before the final whistle, as Seattle ran out comfortable winners in the end.The final round of the 2009 College World Series of baseball is set, with eight teams qualifying for the double-elimination tournament.

Komen St. Louis Race for the Cure, held earlier today in St. Louis, Missouri, became the world's largest Race for the Cure, with over 71,000 participants.2010 marks the twelfth year for the race in St. Louis, which raises money for breast cancer research nationwide. Originally brought to the city in 1999, it has raised over US$19 million. It was sponsored by Wells Fargo Advisors, a locally-headquartered brokerage firm of the financial services provider Wells Fargo. Nationally, the Race for the Cure is hosted by Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a non-profit organization supporting breast cancer research.In 1999, there were only about 10,000 participants in the St. Louis Race for the Cure. In recent years, the number has grown to over 60,000, and today's 5K race saw over 71,000 runners, walkers, and wheelchair racers. Despite the heat and humidity, 1,090 teams signed up, and over 4,500 breast cancer survivors participated. Overall, the race raised more than US$3.3 million. A phone bank set up by Wells Fargo and local television station KSDK contributed over US$28,000 of that amount in four hours.Prior to the race, there was a parade of all the breast cancer survivors who had signed up for the race. The actual competition began at 8:30 a.m. CDT (1330 UTC) with the wheelchair race. Following them were the timed runners, the untimed runners, the walkers, and lastly, the "fun walk" participants, who had only opted to walk one mile (1.6 kilometres).The Komen St. Louis Race for the Cure is only one of many Races for the Cure, which is the largest group of 5K runs and walks in the world. The first Komen race was held in 1983 in Dallas, Texas, but has since spread to over 140 cities throughout the world. Proceeds from today's St. Louis race will benefit both local institutions and the rest of the United States. At least 25 percent of the money raised will go toward funding national research on breast cancer, while the rest will be given to organizations in St. Louis for breast cancer awareness programs.India won the first match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh by 87 runs on February 19.

India's Shanthakumaran Sreesanth had bowled a yorker and the umpire declared it not out. Dhoni referred it to the TV umpire and a replay showed it might have missed the leg stump, so the original decision was upheld. The match marked the debut of the controversial umpire referral system in World Cup cricket.With fifty days left to until the start of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the Australian Paralympic Committee earlier today announced the 35-member final swimming Paralympic squad bound for the London Games.New South Wales swimmers are well represented with Michael Anderson of Repton, Tim Antalfy of Georges Hall, Michael Auprince of Peakhurst, Blake Cochrane of Scarborough, Taylor Corry of Anna Bay, Maddison Elliott of Gillieston Heights, Jacqueline Freney of Skinners Head, Amanda Fowler of Blaxland, Mitchell Kilduff of Carlton, Kara Leo of Penrith, Matthew Levy of Northbridge, Andrew Pasterfield of Castle Hill, Katrina Porter of Newtown, Aaron Rhind of Yass, Sarah Rose of Pymble, Sean Russo of Revesby, Teigan Van Roosmalen of Bateau Bay, Reagan Wickens of Grays Point and Annabelle Williams of Cheltenham being named.Five Queensland swimmers have earned spots to London, including Kayla Clarke of Silkstone, Daniel Fox of Cleveland, Brenden Hall of Petrie, Grant Patterson of Cairns and Rick Pendleton of Sippy Downs.

The wins by the Steel and the Vixens are considered by those who follow the netball league to be major upsets.The Firebirds' loss this past Sunday was their first in fifteen games extending back to last season. Last season's championship is not a harbinger of success this season, as every season since the league was founded in 2008, the defending champions have failed to finish in the top four and attempt to repeat their title claim.  Going into the game, the teams had played eight games against each other, splitting the record at 4 wins each.  The Vixens' win can be credited to several players including English national team player Geva Mentor, and returning Vixen stars Bianca Chatfield and Julie Corletto.  The Firebirds' loss involved poor shooting and bad passing. Firebird captain Laura Geitz's quality play could not overcome other difficulties on the court for her team.In the Magic versus Steel game, the teams were tied at 44–44 with five minutes left in the game. The local crowd were behind the Steel, and they finished the game ahead by two baskets. The Magic's coach blames the loss partly on not preparing adequately to play against the Steel's Donna Wilkins, who gave birth to her third child in January of this year. She also partly blames the loss on several errors. Jess Waitapu made her debut for the Magic because teammate Julianna Naoupu had health problems that impacted her ability to play.On Sunday in Auckland, the favored LG Northern Mystics held on to defeat the Haier Central Pulse 51–47. Silver Ferns member Maria Tutaia was replaced by coach Debbie Fuller in favor of Grace Rasmussen, with Rasmussen making six out of seven shots to help put the game away for her team.  The Mystics had six fewer shots than the visiting Pulse, but had a better shooting percentage which proved to be a decisive factor in the game.In Perth on Monday, the West Coast Fever beat the Easiyo Canterbury Tactix by a score of 55–35. The Tactix were back home in Christchurch on Tuesday. The team's captain Maree Bowden and coach Leigh Gibbs were disappointed in the team's performance but believed there were some positives and room for improvement.The West Coast Fever are the only Australian side in the competition to never have won the league's championship, with their best ever finish being seventh in the ten-team competition.  In September of last year, following the Australian victory at the Netball World Championships held in Singapore in July, the Fever signed Australian national team coach Norma Plummer as the club's new coach. stuff.co.nz's Chris Barclay believes this means the Fever have a chance of winning, especially following a pre-season that included two wins, a tie to the Firebirds and a single loss.  She has sought to instill a greater sense of discipline in her players, not taking excuses for missing practices with the exception of Australian Diamond Susan Fuhrmann who is recovering from a chronic knee injury.  She also sought to improve the Fever's roster with the inclusion of England national netball team player Eboni Beckford-Chamber and former Swifts player Catherine Cox.The Tactix are to play the Swifts at home this coming Monday in the second round. They have not beaten an Australian team since 2009. In the third round, the Tactix will play the Steel, in a game stuff.co.nz's writer Matt Richens believes they can win.In Adelaide this past Saturday, the Adelaide Thunderbirds beat the NSW Swifts by a score of 57–40.Australian Diamond goal attack Sharelle McMahon has taken the season off from the Vixens as a result of pregnancy.Muslim groups from across the world are criticising the organisers of the 2012 Olympics in London after it was revealed that the games will take place over Ramadan. The most holy month in the Muslim calendar, which will take place from the 21 July to 20 August in 2012, involves fasting during daylight hours and will affect an estimated 3,000 athletes. Joanna Manning Cooper, spokesman for the games said: "We did know about it when we submitted our bid and we have always believed that we could find ways to accommodate it."Nevertheless, this will come as a huge embarrassment for the organisers who have tried to ensure the event involve all of Britain's ethnic communities.A quarter of the athletes who took part in the 2004 Athens Olympics were from predominantly Muslim countries and the fast will put any athletes involved at a clear disadvantage.The chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, Massoud Shadjared said: "This is going to disadvantage the athletes and alienate the Asian communities by saying they don't matter. It's not only going to affect the participants, it's going to affect all the people who want to watch the games."The president of the National Olympic Committee of Turkey, Togay Bayalti, said: "This will be difficult for Muslim athletes. They don't have to observe Ramadan if they are doing sport and travelling but they will have to decide whether it is important to them. "It would be nice for the friendship of the Games if they had chosen a different date."The games will run from the 27 July to 12 August to coincide with the British Summer holidays. The summer holidays are a six week period running from mid July to early September. During this time, public transportation is generally less crowded and it will be easier to find the 70,000 volunteers needed to keep the games running. The International Olympics Committee has specified that the games must take place between July 15 to August 31. Giselle Davies, IOC spokesperson said, "We give a window to the five bid cities. The host city selects the dates within that window."The organisers are working with the Muslim Council of Great Britain to find ways around the problem.London, England — The Paralympic Village officially opened on Wednesday in London, with many nations having moved in as of Saturday in preparation for the start of the games.

Standing female French skier Marie Bochet has won six World Cups ahead of the World Championships and is considered by event organizers as a favorite in the standing group. Russian standing skier Alexey Bugaev is also considered a favorite by organisers as he won two Slalom and one Giant Slalom World Cup competition.  In the women's sit-ski, German Anna Schaffelhuber is considered the favorite having prepared for the Championships by winning five of the eight World Cup events.  On the men's sit-ski side, Japanese Takeshi Suzuki and Swiss Christoph Kunz both earned three World Cup victories in the lead up to this competition.  In the women's visually impaired group, Slovak Henrieta Farkasova will enter the competition with five World Cup victories.  On the men's side, Spanish Jon Santacana is favored to win with three Giant Slalom and one Slalom victory during this year's World Cup events in the lead up to the World Championships.British Combined Services Disabled Ski Team coach Mark Scorgie has noted that this year's European ski season has been problematic with weather interfering with most competitions.  Poor weather conditions continued Wednesday Rogla IPC Alpine World Cup, with the first Giant Slalom run canceled because of high winds.The World Championships includes over 270 skiers, guides, coaches and support personnel from 28 countries including Spain, France, Australia, Ukraine, Netherlands, Croatia, Finland, Switzerland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Turkey, Belgium, Norway, Russia, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, Slovakia, Czech Republic, United States, Austria, New Zealand, Sweden, Hungary, and South Africa..

"These are extraordinary circumstances and we simply couldn't or wouldn't expect our players to be emotionally ready to start a Test match the day after farewelling one of their team-mates," said Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland.A new date for the match has not been settled on. It could be held between the Adelaide (December 12–16) and Boxing Day (December 26–30) Tests. An announcement is expected "in the next few days"."After consulting with the players, we have communicated to Cricket Australia that the opportunity to farewell their team mate is the priority, and the prospect of them playing the following day is simply too big an ask," Australian Cricketers' Association chief executive Alistair Nicholson said. "The players are going through a grieving process and they must be afforded the opportunity to do so."Fans who have purchased tickets to this match have been advised to hold onto their tickets.The 2014/15 Test cricket series between Australia and India has been reshuffled, announced Monday night, after the scheduled first match was postponed. Adelaide Oval is now scheduled to host the first match from December 9."Players will look to prepare themselves with the dedication and commitment that is a trademark of our Australian Test cricketers. There is no doubt that their return to the field will be enormously challenging, particularly for those who were present on the SCG [Sydney Cricket Ground] last week," Australian Cricketers' Association head Alistair Nicholson said.The Gabba, in Brisbane, is to host the second Test from December 17. This allows a minimum break of five days before the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Sydney's New Year's Test has been delayed to begin January 6. The limited overs schedule, due to start on January 12, is unaffected.The Philippines will host the 23rd edition of the Southeast Asian Games starting Sunday. The host nation is not just hoping to gain the overall championship, but also seeking to boost its tourism industry. With the venues of the Games spread around the tropical country, officials were taking advantage of the 10-day sporting event to showcase some of the Philippines' best tourist destinations. Some events will be held in the cities of Bacolod and Cebu, and suburbs near Metro Manila. It is also for the first time in the history of the Southeast Asian Games, the opening ceremony will be held in an open-air park instead of in a stadium. Philippine President Gloria Arroyo, will lead the nation in welcoming more than 7,000 athletes, officials and members of the participating countries – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, East Timor, Vietnam and the host.Cebu opened the 23rd Southeast Asian (SEA) Games yesterday with pomp and pageantry. The SEA Games welcome ceremony, served as the "appetizer" for the formal opening in Manila.Security is tight with a 17,000-strong police force on alert to ensure the safety of the thousands of athletes and officials taking part, amid the threat of possible attacks by militants.The government is also determined to impose a strict smoking ban throughout the duration of 23rd Southeast Asian Games. No one will be allowed to smoke within a 50-meter radius from venues in Metro Manila, Bacolod City, Cebu City, the Subic freeport in Zambales province, Angeles City in Pampanga province, Tagaytay in Cavite province, and Los Baños and Calamba in Laguna province. The ban also covers any form of advertisement of tobacco companies.A total of 41 events, 441 gold medals are up for grabs, with the Philippine martial art arnis as well as ballroom dancing making their debuts.The basketball event was cancelled after a dispute involving the Philippines Olympic Council (POC) and Basketball Association of Philippines (BAP), which saw the former expelling the latter. POC and BAP were later embroiled in a court case, which apparently ruled in favour of BAP's reinstatement. In an unexpected move, representatives of the Philippines' largest Muslim separatist group will attend the opening of the SEA Games as a "goodwill measure", a rebel spokesman said yesterday. Eid Kabalu, spokesman for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), said he and four other rebel officials would attend the event to show his group's sincerity in seeking peace in the strife-torn southern region of Mindanao. However, in the capital, there are hardly any banners to herald the 23rd SEA Games. There is no excitement and even the mascot, the eagle, is nowhere in sight. Inconvenienced and incensed by the treatment, the ten visiting countries blasted hosts Philippines for poor arrangements before the start of the 23rd SEA Games."A healthy life starts from Walking." With this quote advertised on TV commercials in Taiwan, 25 divisions in Taiwan simultaneously held the walking events of "Taiwan Walking Day" yesterday. This recreational activity by Sports Affairs Council (SAC) and Ministry of Health (MOH) of Executive Yuan R.O.C. is the 2nd national event after the "Taiwan National Bicycle Day" promoted by SAC on May 5 this year.In the main arena of the Taipei Municipal Chungshan Football Stadium, with the conjunction of "2007 Taiwan Walking Festival" by Republic of China Alpine Association held at Saturday (Nov. 10), this national event in Taipei attracted more than 5 thousand people including VIPs from "2007 Master Forum on Walking in Taiwan", worldwide walking and mountaineering professionals, and local public figures."Walking is a good recreation sport for health, to promote good conceptions on health, we (MOH) will present several books for the participants to make them manage their health well." Sheng-mao Ho (Ministry of Health) told the media. By the way, to promote advantages of recreation sports and health improvement, Jongher Yang (Commissioner of SAC) hopes the public will change the greeting from "Have you eaten yet?" to "Have you done sports yet?".During the national event, the Police Radio System in Taiwan had a live radio SNG to some participated divisions, and some magistrate hoped the public would do more recreational sports to fullfil the goal of "Taiwan Walking Day".A four-year-old Indian boy from the eastern state of Orissa ran 65 kilometers (40 miles) continuously, setting an Indian record and possibly a world record as well.Budhia Singh, a slum resident whose talent was discovered by a local coach, completed his run in seven hours and two minutes.  Budhia had originally planned to run 43 miles, but doctors intervened at the 40-mile mark when he started showing signs of extreme exhaustion.  300 cadets from the Central Reserve Police Force, which plans to sponsor his upbringing, escorted Budhia, while thousands of onlookers cheered him on.Officials from the Limca Book of Records, India's best-known record book, witnessed the run and said that Budhia's accomplishment would appear in the 2007 edition of the book.Coach Biranchi Das says that he had seen Budhia's talent when Budhia accidentally entered a sports field without permission.  Das had the boy run laps as punishment, but after five hours the boy was still running.Human rights groups in India decried the run, saying that government officials endangered Budhia's life by allowing him to run in sweltering temperatures.  "It is an act done so rashly or negligently to endanger human life or the personal safety of others as defined under section 336 of the Indian Penal Code," said Suhas Chakma, director of the Asian Center for Human Rights.Das said that doctors had examined the boy and found nothing wrong."I loved running today. I can run as much as I want," Budhia said after the run.Mike Flynt, 59, of Franklin, Tennessee has made the roster of the Sul Ross State Lobos' football team, and could play as early as September 1, 2007. Flynt last played college football in 1970. Flynt returns reportedly after stating that he regretted his dismissal from the school's football team before his senior year. Flynt eventually received his bachelor's degree from Sul Ross after attending another school where he earned the last 12 credit hours he needed. He transferred those hours back to Sul Ross. Flynt enrolled in graduate school so he can take advantage of his final semester of Division III eligibility.Flynt is giving new meaning to being a college senior. After all, he's a grandfather. He's eight years older than his coach and has two kids older than any of his teammates. His youngest child just started at the University of Tennessee.Flynt's position is still being determined, but he used to play linebacker. Wherever he lines up, just getting into a game likely will make him the oldest player in college football history. Neither the NCAA or NAIA keeps such a statistic, but research hasn't turned up anyone older than mid-40s.And with around 200 pounds (90 kg) on a 5-10 (178 cm) frame, about the only visible difference from his playing days is a shaved head. He's in tremendous shape for his age because he's made a living out of working out. Flynt, who declined an interview request, is paying his own tuition because Division III schools do not offer athletic scholarships.Today, defending champion Novak Djokovic defeated Swiss professional Roger Federer 6–1, 6–2, 3–6 6–3 in the Australian Open 2016 semi-final. Djokovic has previously featured in five Australian finals, winning them all.Serbian Djokovic won the first set 6–1 in just 22 minutes, with ten aces total through the match. It took 32 minutes to complete the second set 6–3, with Federer winning three games of the set, and serving five aces through the entire match. Djokovic had only 20 unforced errors, compared to Federer's 51. The seven-time Wimbledon winner, Federer, made a comeback in the third set, winning it 6–3. It was the longest set of the match, taking 45 minutes.Djokovic managed to win the fourth set 6–3 in 40 minutes, thus going through to the final. With this defeat, Federer suffered a third straight defeat by Djokovic. Last year, he lost in the final of the US Open to Djokovic who won 6–4, 5–7, 6–4, 6–4. Dojkovic won three out of four Grand Slams last year, only losing to Swiss player Stan Wawarinka at Roland Garros in the French Open.Djokovic, the number one seed, is to play in Sunday's final against the winner of Andy Murray, seeded number two, versus Milos Raonic .A 65-year-old woman has been arrested in connection with the deaths of two Mexican midget wrestlers. Brothers Alejandro and Alberto Perez Jimenez were found dead in their hotel room in Mexico City, Mexico. The brothers' drinks had been spiked with a fatal dose of eye drops and the pair were robbed. The mini wrestlers entered their hotel room with two women. Later, surveillance cameras recorded the two women leaving the hotel alone. The police traced and arrested one of the female suspects by way of a stolen cell phone that belonged to the wrestlers. Police are still searching for the second woman. Alejandro and Alberto wrestled on the Lucha Mini Wrestling circuit. The pair fought under the names Espectrito Jr and La Parkita, known as "The Little Ghost" and "Little Death". The female suspect admits meeting the wrestlers but denies poisoning them.Prosecutors say that there are female gangs in Mexico City who drug and rob men.The 65th running of the Aiken Trials was held Saturday, on March 17th at the Aiken Training Track in South Carolina. The event consists of six horse races of a quarter mile to 4 1/2 furlongs that bring experience to new challengers in the field of racing competition. Five of the races were for two-year-old horses and contenders that have not previously won. The sixth race is for horses who have never won a sweepstakes. Orgainizers of the event looked to draw between 10 and 12,000 spectators. Tailgating, and a special VIP tent, along with live music and expanded food vendor services added to the event which has been growing each year. It is the first of three events that form the Aiken Triple Crown. The races began at 2 p.m and lasted until about 5 p.m.The Honourable Peter McGauran, Federal Minister for Agriculture, has issued a 72 hour Australia wide travel ban on all Equine horse species. The ban followed confirmation that 16 horses from two separate Sydney locations have been infected with Equine Influenza. This follows earlier restrictions placed on horses in New South Wales (NSW).Mr McGauran said "There will be a 72-hour ban on all race meetings for both thoroughbreds and harness...""In addition there will be an order for standstill for all horses under licensed persons. Also, an appeal to all those with ponies, recreational horses or work horses not to leave their properties..."Equine flu was first detected in a stallion at Eastern Creek Quarantine station after arriving from the northern hemisphere. There are 80 horses currently in quarantine at either Eastern Creek in New South Wales or at the Spotswood quarantine station in Victoria. These horses are thoroughbreds brought into Australia for the spring breeding season. Horses currently in quarantine are expected to be held for another 30 days.The movement ban caused the cancellation of race meeting across the country, resulting in losses of tens of millions of dollars.Equine flu is highly contagious though it is not infectious to humans, though skin, clothing and equipment can transmit the disease. Additional restrictions have been place on people and equipment in NSW with exclusion zones around the quarantine stations. Breaches of these restriction could result in fines of up to A$44,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months.The normally unrestricted travel of horses between Australia and New Zealand has been suspended and New Zealand authorities are checking all horses that have entered the country since the beginning of August.On Monday local time, a chartered flight carrying 72 passengers and nine crew members crashed on the outskirts of the city of Medellín, Colombia. The Colombian police has indicated only five people on board survived the crash.The British Aerospace 146 was flying from Brazil to Colombia via Bolivia. The plane reported facing electrical problems near La Ceja and La Unión before crashing at roughly 10:15pm local time (0315 Tuesday UTC). The crash site had bad weather, and heavy fog prevented rescue helicopters from landing.According to initial reports, six passengers were rescued but later one of them died in hospital.The flight was carrying Brazilian Série A football team Chapecoense's delegations. Chapecoense was scheduled to play Colombian club Atlético Nacional today in the Copa Sudamericana final; Copa Sudamericana is South America's second-tier club competition, the winner of which is promoted to the first-tier competition of Copa Libertadores in the next season. The Chapecó based club were promoted to the first division Série A in 2014. They are currently ninth in the league table and the final league match of the season was scheduled to be played on Sunday against Atlético Mineiro. Reaching the final of Copa Sudamericana was the best outcome in the club's history.By varying reports either 21 or 22 Brazilian football journalists where also on the flight. The five survivors include at least two football players, who have been identified as Alan Ruschel and Jakson Follmann.South America's governing body of football CONMEBOL has suspended the upcoming fixture. Atlético Nacional were scheduled to play the second leg of the final on December 7.Brazilian president Michel Temer tweeted, "I express my solidarity at this sad time when dozens of Brazilian families have been affected by tragedy." ((pt))Portuguese language: ‍Nesta hora triste que a tragédia se abate sobre dezenas de famílias brasileiras, expresso minha solidariedade. Temer has also called three-day mourning in Brazil.Atlético Nacional requested CONMEBOL award the Copa Sudamericana to Chapecoense. Several Brazilian clubs said they would loan players to Chapecoense for the upcoming season for free. They also requested Chapecoense be granted three seasons' immunity from relegation to a lower division.Round 6 of the Hyundai A-League produced an interesting first for the competition in its short existence, and something which has been totally against the grain so far this season. In the 20 games so far this season, only three home wins had been recorded, but for the first time ever in the league, all four home teams won their respective matches in a single round. The Mariners stay four points clear at the top despite losing its first game of the season against Adelaide, while Wellington had their first taste of victory at home, with the Phoenix smashing Perth 4-1. Melbourne and Sydney are set for a blockbuster in Sydney next week, after both had hard fought wins.Attendance/Average: 60,523 / 15,131Goal of the Week: Alex Brosque - Sydney FCPlayer of the Week: Bruce Djite - Adelaide UnitedRound 7 of the A-League 2007-08 has produced some interesting moments throughout the country. Accusations have been made that the A-League's 'thug-like' onfield play has decreased its good name, but all teams enjoyed a close-to satisfying game, whatever the result.WA team Perth Glory is still stalling in its win drought, sparking calls for coach Ron Smith's dismissal, however this was met with limited concern. The low attendance numbers were partly due to the Perth Glory vs Adelaide United match with one of the lowest crowds in Perth's history, 6252.Attendance/Average: 49,768 / 12,442The Chicago White Sox scored a narrow 5–4 victory Monday against the Detroit Tigers after White Sox player A.J. Pierzynski scored a go-ahead run in extra innings. The go-ahead run gave the White Sox two extra runs."We're just finding ways to win games. We're battling. We're not giving at-bats away," Pierzynski, catacher for the White Sox, said after the game.Though the White Sox led 3–2 in the fourth inning, Mark Kotsay got out at home plate when attempting to get the White Sox a fourth run. Later, Tiger Don Kelly scored a home run, pushing the Tigers up to a lead of 4–2. The homer had both Kelly and Miguel Cabrera scoring a run each. The White Sox also hit a run in the eighth inning.Also notable was that rookie relief pitcher Chris Sale won his first game after pitching in the tenth inning. Sale, who is on the Sox, earned praise from Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen, who said "very, very pleasant surprise. Very, very nice."The White Sox are currently 3 1/2 games behind the Minnesota Twins in the American League Central Division in the MLB. The Sox currently has a record of 77 wins and 60 losses, and have won four games in a row. The Detroit Tigers are third in the Central Division with a record of 68–70, and are 13 games behind Minnesota.The game was played in Comerica Park in Detroit. 32,924 people attended the game.It was Taupo, New Zealand's turn to host the sixth race A1 Grand Prix (A1GP) contest, it is also the first A1GP competition this year and the first A1GP race in Taupo ever. The track in Taupo was just finished a week ago.In qualifying on Saturday, Germany, driver Nicolas "Nico" Hülkenberg, managed to get the fastest two out of four lap times, their first ever pole position; France managed to get second placing, with their first A1GP driver Loic Duval; and Black Beauty, New Zealand, driver Jonny Reid managed to get third place. The qualifying results determine the starting place for the 14-lap sprint race.The first attempt at the rolling sprint race failed because of line up trouble so it was done again. During the sprint race on Sunday the top three racers did not trade places with Germany, France and New Zealand remaining in their respective order. The finishing place in the sprint race determines the starting place in the 50-lap feature race the same day.During the standing start feature race Germany managed to get a strong lead, leaving France and New Zealand to battle it out for second place. New Zealand tried to take second place a few times but always not having enough speed to complete the takeover. New Zealand's best chance for a takeover was at lap nine at the pit stop, but France had a one second better pit stop than New Zealand did, keeping their lead.A few drivers crashed during the feature race and sprint race. A very impressive crash happened during the sprint race between Great Britain and Malaysia, which resulted in Great Britain's front being smashed.Germany, the overall leader with 65 points, easily managed to get first place, around 19.5 seconds ahead of second place France and third place went to New Zealand. It was Germany's first time that they had managed to get a double win on the same day.Germany and Nico Hulkenberg, were presented their gold medal by the minister of recreation and sport, Honourable Trevor Mallard, the same person who gave the announcement to the drivers, "Gentlemen, for the pride of your nation, start your engine."First place, second place and third place got, as well as their respective medals, a unique piece of New Zealand, a Māori carving, which got progressively bigger for each placer.An Air New Zealand Boeing 777 and A1GP Team New Zealand's car held two races together at an operational airport today.Auckland International Airport this morning (NZDT) offered the use of a runway for the national airline of New Zealand and the national A1GP team to race against each other.The A1GP car nicknamed Black Beauty was driven by official race driver, Jonny Reid; and the commercial airliner codenamed NZ Alpha One (NZA1) piloted by Captain Dave Morgan.Mr Reid said, "I've never been on a such a wide track before and it was fantastic looking across and seeing the Boeing 777 alongside me - it was something else altogether."Captain Morgan was able to win the first race against Mr Reid after it was given a head start due to its slow start time. NZA1 left the tarmac traveling at around 270 km/h, whereas Black Beauty had just sped past at 300 km/h.In the second race, Black Beauty managed to win despite having a slower start due to surface water on the runway. But water was not too much of a problem because the track was straight, Mr Reid says.Black Beauty was not able to reach its top speed due to a speed limiter being required for A1GP races.Prior to the commencement of the first race, Captain Morgan said that the biggest challenge he faces is trying to keep NZA1 on the ground due to less fuel than normally on a test flight, and no passengers.Auckland International Airport managed to accommodate the race while just adjusting scheduled times and keeping the rest of the airport fully functional after being approached with the deal six-months ago. The airport has never closed since opening 42-years ago.The stunt was used for promotion of the next race, to be held on January 20 at Taupo, New Zealand. Twenty-one nations will be arriving to take part in the sprint and feature race. Team New Zealand is currently ranked third in overall standings.Jonny Reid, co-driver for the A1GP New Zealand team, today made history by driving the fastest over the 48-year-old Auckland Harbour Bridge, New Zealand, legally.Mr Reid managed to drive the New Zealand's A1GP car, Black Beauty at speeds over 160km/h seven times over the bridge. The New Zealand police had trouble using their speed radar guns to see how fast Mr Reid was going because of how low Black Beauty is, and the only time the police managed to clock Mr Reid was when he slowed down to 160km/h.Black Beauty, like all the other A1 Grand Prix cars, is powered by a V8 engine, 3.4 litres and has a top speed of 300km/h. During the record attempt, it managed to get to 160km/h from zero in under three seconds.The stunt was to promote the upcoming A1GP sixth round at Taupo in a couple of weeks, which Mr Reid will be racing because of his two wins at Indonesia, instead of other co-driver, Matt Halliday.Mr Reid performed the record on the clipon lanes of the bridge which were closed at Christmas because the lanes were being resurfaced. The lanes will be open this Monday, January 8.Mr Reid said the surface at the top of the bridge hadn't been swept so it was quite slippery. "It was mega slippery at the top but we always knew that would be the situation and it was just great to show the public a little bit of what we were about." However he also said that "It was fully under control."Mr Reid said the buzz from doing that, especially with the help from police, was huge. "I absolutely thrived on it. It was a very unique experience which you don't come across every day. It was mega, it really was."Mr Reid assures everyone that the speeds he will be reaching in Taupo will be much, much faster than what he achieved today.Once Mr Reid had finished crossing the bridge seven times, he finished with a few doughnuts.Two cars were involved in a nose to tail crash on one of the northbound lanes trying to watch the action.Earlier tonight in Zurich, United States national team soccer player Abby Wambach was named 2012 FIFA World Player of the Year, soccer's yearly designation for the best women's player in the world, beating out teammate Alex Morgan and five time winner Brazilian national team member  Marta.Wambach became the first woman from the United States to win the award since Mia Hamm in 2002.  Her victory came in the same year she aided her team in winning a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics and where she personally contributed five goals in her team's effort.The men's award, the Ballon d'Or, was won by Argentinian national team player and Spanish La Liga Barcelona FC player Lionel Messi for the fourth consecutive time.Bobby Abreu, welcome to the spotlight.The Philadelphia Phillies star, now 31 and a two-time All-Star, has produced well for the Phillies over the last half a decade without the glamour of other top players. However, last night there was no denying that he was the star of the show.And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 Home Run Derby, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described Comerica Park, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's David Ortiz (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's Carlos Lee to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star Ivan Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke Miguel Tejada's record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park.On Monday night, Australian Football player Adam Cooney won the Australian Football League's most prestigious award, the Brownlow Medal, awarded to the AFL's best and fairest. He received 24 votes, ahead of Simon Black with 23 votes and Gary Ablett and Matthew Richardson with 22 votes. Cooney took the lead after 20 rounds of votes had been cast (from twenty-two), and is the first Western Bulldogs player to win the medal since 1992.Cooney was surprised to win the medal, after having been locked out of the vote count for two rounds (after having been to the toilet), and at one point, about to leave the vote count, believing he had little chance of winning the medal. However, he returned, and took the lead.The Brownlow Medal is the start of AFL Grand Final week, which ends on Saturday, September 29, with the AFL Grand Final, with the Geelong Cats playing against the Hawthorn Hawks at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.It should also be noted that AFL CEO, Andrew Demetriou mistakenly started reading out the votes for Round 2 first, instead of the votes for Round 1.Hawker, Canberra — Coming off a national championship win for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) men's open team in mid-February, Australia men's national softball team representatives Nick Norton and Adam Folkard are getting ready for more softball later this year, including the Australian club championships to be held in Brisbane in June.Folkard and Norton have both won the World Championships and have each won a total of ten national championships with the ACT side. They are both named to the current men's national team, which has roughly thirty players, and believe they are likely to survive the December cut down to eighteen players who will represent Australia at next year's World Championship in Auckland, New Zealand.The World Championship is one of the two most prestigious available to male softball players.  The other is the International Softball Congress, an event Folkard and Norton have both competed at.As national team representatives, there are a lot of expectations for them.  In Australia, there is almost no financial support for the men's game so they must cover most of their own costs, including travel to and from international competitions.  According to Folkard's father, these costs can be prohibitive.  In one year, when Folkard was a representative on the men's U18, U23 and Open team, it cost A$15,000 for travel and other expenses just for Folkard.  When costs for bringing family members such as Folkard's sisters to major international tournaments, the costs were even higher.  Folkard, his father and Norton all joked this cost his father an investment property to allow Folkard to continue to compete at the highest level.  Both Folkard and Norton currently work as tradesmen to support softball playing.Beyond money, the national team requires players to be actively involved in wider softball community.  Players must represent a club at the club championships in Brisbane if they want to retain a spot in the squad.  Folkard plays for a Western Australian club and Norton plays for a Sydney based club, driving down from Canberra to play every Sunday during the season.Folkard and Norton have both played softball at the highest level in the United States, where the men's game is not yet fully professionalized but still presents more opportunities for players than are available at home. For several years, Folkard has gone to the United States for three-month stints, playing for teams in Chicago, Pennsylvania, and New York.  One side he played was sponsored by Ernst and Young.  Folkard currently plays for a Canadian side and has been trying to convince Norton, whom he has grown up playing softball with, to join him like Norton has done one previous season.  According to Folkard, playing with a North American club has certain advantages.  The clubs pay for his travel to and from Australia, and pay for Championship rings.  When asked how North American clubs sign Australian players, he said they follow men's softball in Australia and call up players to offer contracts.  Australian men's players gain additional exposure to potential clubs when they compete, with some sides approaching them during the North American season and seeking to contract them for the following season.Both men would love the opportunity to play softball in the Olympics, but believe such an opportunity is unlikely.  According to them, softball at the Olympics is a women's game intrinsically linked to men's baseball, and men's softball is unlikely to ever be considered on the programme as a result.Folkard and Norton both play for the same club in the ACT territory club competition.  Their team has secured a grand final berth for the match in ten days.  They are waiting to find out who they will play against based on a match this weekend.  Both have previously won this competition.The 2007 AFC Asian Cup has begun in South-East Asia, with Thailand drawing 1-1 with Iraq in the opening match of the tournament.The Asian Cup is the premier international competition for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The 2007 tournament will run from July 7 to July 29, featuring a group stage and then four progressive knock-out rounds.The 2007 Asian Cup is the first in its' 43-year history to be co-hosted by four nations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam will each host one of the four groups, and will take two games each in the knockout rounds. The final is scheduled for Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia on July 29.Heavy rain caused the opening ceremony of the Cup, held at the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok prior to the Group A match, to be delayed. Hosts Thailand took the lead in the sixth minute when referee Kwon Jung-Chul awarded them a penalty kick. Striker Kiatisuk Senamuang was deemed to have been fouled when brought to ground by Iraqi defender Ali Rehema.Iraq nearly equalised in the sixteenth minute after a spectacular overhead 'bicycle kick' by Salir Sadwn was saved by Thailand goalkeeper Kosin Hathairattanakool, who pushed the ball onto the post and eventually cleared. Iraq equalised in the thirty-second minute when captain Younis Mahmoud headed a ball over 'keeper Kosin and into the net from a free kick by Sadwn. Despite dominating the first half, Iraq went into half-time level at 1-1.Both teams tired in the second half, but the three best chances to take the lead fell to the hosts. Therdsak Chaiman and Datsakorn Thonglao both shot just wide either side of the hour mark, and substitute Teeratep Winothai forced a save out of Iraqi goalkeeper Noor Hassan with an effort from outside the penalty box five minutes from the end. The game ended at 1-1, however, and means both Thailand and Iraq move to one point each in the Group A ladder after one match played. Oman and Australia are the other two teams in the goup. Australia will make their Asian Cup debut later today after moving from the Oceania Confederation to the AFC at the start of 2006.The Australians are considered favourites, along with defending champions Japan, to win the tournament in their first outing, following their impressive show in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. They reached the second round after qualifying from Group F, including a 3-1 win over Japan, before losing by the single goal - an injury time penalty - to eventual champions Italy.Tournament favourites and debutants Australia have drawn 1-1 with a skillful Oman in the second match in Group A of the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Oman shocked the Socceroos when they scored on thirty-two minutes, after some enterprising play on their left-hand flank. A ball cut back made its' way through the Australian defence to Omani striker Badar Mubarak, who slotted the ball low into the left-hand corner of the goal.Oman very nearly had a second goal on three separate occasions in the second half. They were only denied by three world-class saves by Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, including a low save from a driving volley by Ahmed Mubarak, a reflex save to stop a point-blank header in the seventieth minute, and then another low-down save minutes later from Fawi Bashir's driving shot.A heavy downpour began ten minutes prior to the final whistle, and it appeared to reinvigorate Australia. They pressed forward in numbers, and were rewarded in injury time with a goal to Everton midfielder Tim Cahill, after a low volley by Marco Bresciano was well-saved by Omani keeper Suleiman Al Mazroui.Cahill achieved the remarkable double of scoring both Australia's first Asian Cup and World Cup goals, after he scored in the eighty-third minute of their match against Japan at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He and John Aloisi capped off the comeback by scoring twice late to defeat Japan 3-1.The Australian players were visibly frustrated by Oman's play-acting tactics, which saw the stretcher used four times in the first half alone. British match commentator Simon Hill described the tactics as "a blight to the game" and "absolutely rubbish", the latter in relation to one incident where no contact was made whatsoever. When queried about it after the game, Arnold said cynically "welcome to Asia".The Australians were flat and their defending was poor, said coach Graham Arnold at the post-match media conference. He also commented on goalkeeper Schwarzer's three fantastic saves, saying "Mark Schwarzer's got us out of jail. Schwarzer's made two unbelievable saves, otherwise it's 2-0 and all over".The draw leaves all four Group A teams equal on the table on one point, with one goal for and one against, following Iraq 1-1 draw with hosts Thailand yesterday.In the other game played yesterday (UTC), co-hosts Vietnam caused a major shock by defeating United Arab Emirates in their Group B fixture.The Emirates are the current Gulf Cup champions, and the hosts were expected to struggle to win this match, or progress from Group B which includes two-time Asian champions Japan and Asian Games gold medallists Qatar. Vietnam is playing at Asian Cup level for the first time in nearly half a century.UAE had the better of the chances in an otherwise-even first half, with the best Faisal Khalil's shot in the thirtieth minute, which was well-saved by Vietnamese goalkeeper Duong Hong Son who managed to turn the ball around the post for a corner.However, they scored two second half goals to take the three points from the My Dinh National Stadium. On sixty-three minutes, a counter-attack from the half-way line involving three Vietnamese players resulted in defender Huynh Quang Thanh putting the ball in the back of the net.Vietnamese player of the year Le Cong Vinh made it 2-0 nine minutes later when he chased down a long ball and calmly lobbed it over Emirates goalkeeper Majed Nasser, who had come off his line to try and avert the danger.Bruno Metsu, coach of the United Arab Emirates, substituted players and launched an all-out attack to try and salvage something, but failed to find the goals he needed.Co-hosts Indonesia have defeated Bahrain 2-1 in their opening 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group D fixture.Cheered on by 60,000 predominantly-Indonesian fans at the Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia took the lead in the fourteenth minute through Budi Sudarsono.Sudarsono received a lofted ball from midfield and pushed his first touch around the advancing Bahrain goalkeeper, Abdul Rahman Ahmed. Left with an open goal, the Indonesian striker calmly slotted home the first goal of the match.Bahrain equalised thirteen minutes later when midfielder Sayed Mahmood Jalal prodded the ball into the back of the net. After a curling cross from the right-hand side, the Indonesian defence failed to clear, and the ball found its' way through the goalline scramble for Jalal to score.The scores remained 1-1 until half time, however Indonesia took the lead again on sixty-four minutes. Midfielder Firman Utina drove a low, hard shot towards the Bahrain goal from 30 yards out, forcing a low save by Bahrain goalkeeper Ahmed. Ahmed's save rebounded onto the post and back out towards the penalty spot, where Bambang Pamungkas charged onto the loose ball and placed it in the top-right hand corner of the net.Indonesia sit atop the Group D table after just the one match, with Iran and Uzbekistan playing the second match in the group.In Group C, Malaysia became the only of the four co-hosts not to take any points from their first Group Stage match when they lost to China 5-1.Striker Han Peng and midfielder Wang Dong both scored doubles for the visitors at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, Kuala Lumpur, taking them to equal leaders of the individual goalscoring list. Han Peng got China's first in the fifteenth minute when he headed home a cross from the right-hand wing. Midfielder Shao Jiayi got their second after thirty-six minutes, when a pass cut back from near the goal-line reached him on the far post after leaving the Malaysian goalkeeper Azizon Abdul Kadir stranded. The score remained at 2-0 at half time.Six minutes after the break, Wang Dong got his first of two goals when his shot from twenty yards was deflected, again leaving the Malaysian goalkeeper stranded going in the wrong direction. Han Peng got his second only four minutes later, after he got on the end of a cross from the right-hand wing by midfielder Mao Jianqing.Malaysia made the score 4-1 after Indra Putra Mahayuddin scored from 25 yards. After receiving a lay-off from Hairuddin Omar, Indra Putra sent a curling strike past outstretched Chinese goalkeeper Li Leilei and into the bottom of the net.Wang Dong completed his double in the ninety-third and final minute of the match, with a looping header over the Malaysian goalkeeper. The pass to Wang Dong, a lofted ball from outside the penalty area, drew 'keeper Kadir off his line to allow Wang Dong to head over and into the goal.As with Indonesia, China now sit atop Group C with a good goal difference. The other Group C teams are Korea Republic play Saudi Arabia, who will play at the same stadium twenty-four hours after the China-Malaysia game.Iran have scored late to draw 2-2 with China in their 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group C fixture.China made a dominant start over the Iranians, and were rewarded on five minutes when Shao Jiayi struck a curling free kick into the top-left hand corner of the goal, despite Iranian goalkeeper Hassan Roudbarian getting one hand to the shot.Mao Jianqing then doubled China's advantage after thirty-six minutes. A defensive error saw an Iranian central defender become attracted to the ball rather than the attackers, and Zheng Zhi crossed a ball from the right which found Mao. He took a touch off his chest and then struck the half-volley into the bottom-left hand corner.Iran managed to equalize just before the break. A free kick was awarded to the Iranian team twenty-five yards out from China's goal, and after a short lay-off, Zandi struck a curling strike which beat a diving Li Leilei in the China goal.The Iranians then found an equalizer. Captain Mehdi Mahdavikia swung a ball in from the right hand side of the field after a corner was taken short, and Nekounam jumped high at the near post to put Iran level after seventy-three minutes.Iran will play Malaysia and China meet Uzbekistan in the final matches of the group. Given Malaysia's form in the tournament to date, it is likely that Iran will defeat the co-hosts. If this occurs, or Malaysia holds Iran to a draw, Uzbekistan must defeat China to progress to the quarter-finals, whilst a draw would be enough for the Chinese. Malaysia cannot mathematically make the next round.In Group D, Bahrain have scored late to defeat Korea Republic 2-1.Kim Do-Heon put the Koreans one goal up after just four minutes after Bahrain failed to clear a free kick properly. However, two minutes before half time, Salman Isa put Bahrain level after a free kick by Mohamed Hosain found Isa on the back post. The Koreans were the more aggressive team in the second half, but failed to finish their chances. In the eighty-fifth minute, Bahrain found the winner when Ismaeel Abdullatif capitalized on a defensive mistake by Kim Jung-woo to score.Korea must beat Indonesia at the Bung Karno Stadium, Jakarta two goals or more and have the result of the other game, between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, not end in a draw to progress to the quarter-finals. Bahrain must defeat the Saudi Arabians to progress.Iraq has defeated Australia 3-1 in their 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group A match at the Rajamangala Stadium, Bangkok, Thailand.Iraq took the lead after twenty-three minutes when midfielder Nashat Akram scored. He curled in a free kick from around thirty yards out, and Salih al Sadwn rushed towards Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Al Sadwn's presence sufficiently distracted Schwarzer, who dived the wrong way.The score remained at 1-0 until half time. Two minutes after the break, Australia equalised through striker Mark Viduka. The Australian captain managed to head a curling cross by midfielder Brett Emerton back across Iraqi Noor Hassan's goal and into the top corner.However, Iraq scored twice to win the match, the former through a defensive error by Australia. Hawar Mulla Mohammed was played through with a lovely ball from a teammate, who had attracted the Australian central defence out-of-position. Mohammed slotted the ball home from 15 yards to re-take the lead.Iraq sealed the three Group A points when Karrar Jassim Mohammed scored in the eighty-sixth minute. He managed to get on the end of a deflected shot and calmly tap the ball into an empty net, after goalkeeper Schwarzer had dived to defend the initial shot.The win puts Iraq on equal-top of the group with hosts Thailand. If Iraq defeats or draws with Oman in their final Group A encounter, they will progress through to the quarter-final stage. Australia must defeat Thailand to remain any chance of progressing through to the next stage.In the event that Australia win (ie. are on four points) and Iraq win or draw (ie. are on seven or five points), Australia will progress through to the next stage on head-to-head rather than Thailand despite having a possibly-worse goal difference. Goal difference (goals for minus goals against) is only used to separate two teams if they drew in their head-to-head match in the group stage. If Iraq lose to Oman and Australia win, all four teams will end up on four points. It is unclear how the head-to-head rule will be applied by the AFC in this situation, and it is probable that goal difference will be used.In Group B, Japan defeated United Arab Emirates 3-1 at the My Dinh National Stadium, Hanoi, Vietnam.Defending champions Japan took the lead when Naohiro Takahara scored after twenty-two minutes. Takahara doubled their advantage five minutes later when he sent a lovely volley into the right-hand side of the net after twenty-seven minutes, leaving Emirates goalkeeper Majed Maqdemi stranded.Shunsuke Nakamura made it 3-0 before half time when he converted a penalty kick awarded to Japan on forty-two minutes. The Emirates scored a goal after sixty-six minutes through Saeed Alkas, but no comeback eventuated and the final score was 3-1 top Japan.It leaves Japan equal on top of the Group B table with Vietnam on two points, with the teams locked on four points each. The winner of the match will take top spot in the group. In the event that the Japan-Vietnam match is drawn, both teams have a goal difference of +2. However, Japan have scored one more goal than Vietnam, and will take top spot in the group on that basis.Qatar, the other team in Group B, must win against UAE and hope for a winner in the Japan-Vietnam match to progress, or else defeat the Emirates by three goals or more. Qatar drew both matches with Japan and Vietnam, meaning it will come down to goal difference if two sides are equal on four points. The UAE cannot reach the quarter-finals stage.A lighting failure five minutes from the end interrupted the 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group D match between Korea Republic and Saudi Arabia.The match, played at the Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia, was stopped for 27 minutes after the lighting on one half of the stadium suddenly turned off.At the time of the disruption - 84 minutes 35 seconds played - the match was delicately poised at one goal apiece.An spokesperson for the Asian Football Confederation has said that the lighting failure was 'due to problems with power around Jakarta city'.Referee Mark Shield, from Australia, immediately stopped the match after the lights turned out. Under tournament rules, officials had one hour to get the lights and play restarted before the match would have to be abandoned. An emergency generator was used to restore some of the knocked-out lights to a sufficient level for playing, allowing Shield to restart play after the lengthy delay.The match was an eventful one generally, especially after half time. Both teams played a cautious first half which was devoid of any real scoring opportunities.However, after the break, Korea went 1-0 ahead through striker Choi Sung-Kuk after sixty-six minutes. A curling cross from the left-hand wing found the head of Sung-Kuk, who moved in front of the Saudi defender and headed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner of the net.Eleven minutes later, referee Shield awarded Saudi Arabia a penalty kick after Malek Mouath was adjudged to have been fouled inside the penalty box by a Korean defender. Captain Yasser Al-Qahtani stepped up and converted to level the scores 1-1 after seventy-seven minutes.After play was restarted due to the power failure, Saudi Arabia had an excellent chance to win the match with the final kick of the game. Striker Saad Al Harthi missed a one-on-one opportunity with the Korean goalkeeper, pushing his shot wide.The draw leaves hosts Indonesia on top of the Group D table after defeating Bahrain 2-1 in the opening match of the group.In Group C, Iran has come back from a goal down to defeat Uzbekistan 2-1 at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, Kuala Lumpur.Iran conceded the lead to Uzbekistan on sixteen minutes when Iranian defender Rahman Rezaei scored an own goal. Trying to head the ball back to his goalkeeper Hassan Roudbarian, Rezaei only managed to head the ball over Roudbarianand into the back of his own net.The score remained 1-0 until the fifty-fifth minute, when Iran equalised through Seyed Jalal Hosseini. Hosseini headed a fast-moving corner kick from the right hand side by Mehdi Mahdavikia past Uzbekistan's defence to equalize.Iran then went ahead after seventy-eight minutes after midfielder Andranik Teymourian provided a through-pass which found Javad Kazemian on the edge of the penalty box. Kazemian struck his shot sweetly to beat the goalkeeper and made the scoreline 2-1.No further goals came, however Iranian coach Amir Ghalenoei was sent from the sidelines by the referee due to an indiscretion. The result puts Iran on three points and at the top of Group C, however they trail China, who defeated Malaysia 5-1 a day prior, on goal difference.An eighty-eighth minute goal has given Gulf Cup champions Qatar a 1-1 draw with Japan in their 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group B match at the My Dinh National Stadium, Hanoi, Vietnam.Three-time champions and current defending champions of the Asian Cup competition, Japan scored in the sixty-first minute through prolific striker Naohiro Takahara. They held the lead for nearly half an hour before Sebastián Quintana levelled the scores at 1-1 for Qatar.Japan's goal was the result of a clever finish by Takahara after getting on the end of a Yasuyuki Konno cross from the left-hand wing. A series of passes around the edge of Qatar's penalty area ended up with a through-ball for Konno on the left, who precisely drilled his left-footed cross for Takahara to smartly strike on the half-turn into the net.Japanese midfielder Yuki Abe fouled Quintana two metres outside the box, and Quintana sweetly struck the ball to the right of the defensive wall and past Japanese goalkeeper and captain Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi on eighty-eight minutes.The drama-packed last few minutes included the goal as well as a straight red card against Qatar defender Hussain Yasser for a reckless tackle. Australian referee Matthew Breeze adjudged Yasser to have dangerously lunged at Japanese midfielder Hideo Hashimoto with the studs showing, collecting him both late and above the ball, two minutes into injury time.Qatar coach Džemaludin Mušović was sent away from the sideline by Breeze immediately following Yasser's dismissal, after overzealously protesting the referee's decision to send his player off. When Mušović initially failed to leave, the sideline-based fourth official intervened and he made his way to the grandstand.The result leaves underdog hosts Vietnam on top of Group B after their upset victory over the United Arab Emirates yesterday.Saudi Arabia has scored in injury time to defeat Indonesia 2-1 in their 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group D fixture.Saudi Arabia took the lead after twelve minutes, when Yasser Al-Qahtani headed home a cross from the right hand side of the field by Ahmed Al Bahri. His header was driven low and to the left of the Indonesian goalkeeper Yandri Christian Pitoy, who dived but failed to get his right hand to the ball.Indonesia struck back and levelled eight minutes later, when Elie Aiboy rounded Saudi goalkeeper Yasser Al Mosailem and calmly slotted the ball into the empty net. Elie received a through-ball from Budi Sudarsono and kept his composure, going to the left of the advancing goalkeeper and taking an extra touch before putting the ball into the back of the net.Both goalkeepers made saves to keep their sides level, with Mosailem making two late in the first half to keep Saudi Arabia level at the break. Pitoy made a couple of excellent saves late in the second half, and Indonesian defender Maman Abdurrahman made a precise sliding tackle to stop a one-on-one opportunity for Al Qahtani on seventy-eight minutes.The 88,000 predominantly-Indonesian fans inside the Bung Karno Stadium, Jakarta were silenced by a Saad Al-Harthi goal in the ninety-second minute. A swinging free kick from the left hand side saw Al-Harthi leap and head the ball beyond goalkeeper Pitoy's grasp to give Saudi Arabia all three points and the lead of Group D. Korea Republic play Bahrain this afternoon (UTC) in the fourth Group D fixture.In Group C, Uzbekistan has defeat Malaysia 5-0 at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, Kuala Lumpur. It is Malaysia's second consecutive five-goal defeat, after they lost to China 5-1 in their other Group C fixture.Maksim Shatskikh opened the scoring after ten minutes with a back-post header. Timur Kapadze then doubled Uzbekistan's advantage on twenty-nine minutes, before Ulugbek Bakaev converted a penalty kick just before half time to make the score 3-0.After the break, Malaysia dug in and didn't concede again for forty minutes. On eighty-five minutes, Aziz Ibragimov broke through to score. Shatskikh completed his double and the 5-0 result in the eighty-ninth minuteThe result leaves Uzbekistan on top of Group C on three points, equal with China and Iran. The latter two play each other this afternoon (UTC).Qatar have drawn with co-host Vietnam 1-1 in their 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group B match, played in front of a capacity 40,000 spectators at the My Dinh National Stadium, Hanoi.Vietnam started strongly, although failed to create any meaningful opportunities on the Qatar goal. However, their first real chance resulted in a goal after thirty-two minutes. Vietnam striker Phan Thanh Bình sent the ball towards goal from 25 yards, and the Qatar goalkeeper Mohamed Saqr had the ball slip through his hands and trickle over the line.The score was 1-0 at half time.

Running with the ball, he took one touch on his chest and then half-volleyed the ball home from the edge of the penalty area. Thailand currently sit atop Group A on four points, with Australia to play Iraq this afternoon (UTC).File:Soccer-City-Stadium-at-capacity.jpgHosts South Africa played the Cape Verde Islands Saturday in the first game of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations football tournament in Group A. The game ended 0–0 in front of 50,000 fans at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. The South African national team, known as Bafana Bafana, failed to score despite the home advantage.Cape Verde, who made their Africa Cup of Nations debut, had one of the best chances of the game when Platini broke through on goal but fired wide. With the 0–0 score, the Cape Verde Islands, who have a population of only about 500,000, took their first point of the tournament.After a long period of heavy rain in Johannesburg the conditions were wet, causing problems for play. Cape Verde goalkeeper Vozhina spilled a save from a free kick before eventually gathering the ball. With both teams failing to string together a series of passes, they resorted to long balls to advance up the pitch.Towards the end of the game, South Africa had a penalty appeal rejected. The South African bench had called for a penalty after Bernard Parker appeared to have been brought down in the box by Toni Varela, but the referee carried on play. South Africa nearly took the game in injury time but Bongani Khumalo's header floated over the crossbar from close range. Both managers spoke to the media after the match, with differing reactions to the draw. South African coach Gordon Igesund said, "The first half was a complete waste of 45 minutes. We got a point. I don't think we deserve too much more than that, to be honest." Cape Verde manager Luico Antunes expressed joy with the result. He said, "I'm happy with the performance of the team. It'll make Cape Verde's 500,000 people happy. Today, I can hold my head up high. It means that our team has been well organised. Not conceding goals makes the team more confident."South Africa and Cape Verde are in Group A along with Angola and Morocco.The Australian Football League (AFL) has recently come under fire for not supporting European Australian rules football organisations. Local teams have affiliated with AFL teams who help provide them with balls, guernseys and other equipment."Since 1995 we have been asking the AFL for support on a regular basis, mostly concerning material. Apart from a few footballs, there was basically no support," said Malte Schudlich, president of AFL Germany. "We would be in exactly the same situation today if we would have never had any contact with the AFL."Australian rules football is played on a field 170 metres by 160 metres. The two teams consist of 18 players a side. Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total).Geelong star Gary Ablett tonight took out the 2007 AFL premiers' best and fairest award, the Carji Greeves Medal, well clear of runner-up - Brownlow medallist, Jimmy Bartel.Ablett polled 691 votes, 178 more than runner-up Bartel, with Cameron Ling 11 votes back, for 167 in third place. Ablett's win capped a stellar year in which he also won the AFL Players Association's Most Valuable Player award, and was named the Coaches' Association's player of the year. He polled votes in every one of his 22 home-and-away matches, and was voted best-on-ground in seven games.He joins his father Gary Ablett Sr. as a best and fairest winner, with Ablett Sr having earned the award in 1984. The award remains elusive for Brownlow medallist Bartel. It was the second straight year in which he was runner-up, having trailed Paul Chapman last season. In other awards handed out by the club tonight:Best First-year Player: won by Joel Selwood, winner of the AFL Rising Star award.Best Clubman: went to defender Matthew Egan, who missed the finals series through injury.With only a few days before final nominations for spots to compete at the London Olympic Games and little less than a month until the start of them, African Olympians are trying to finalize their selections while preparing for their moment on the Olympic stage. Meanwhile, with two months before their own event, African Paralympians continue their own preparations this week including qualification competitions and tournaments that aid in team selection.With a £25,000 grant on offer to any Olympic team willing to base themselves in the United Kingdom ahead of the Games, several national delegations took advantage of the opportunity to arrive early to train, acclimate and get the full Olympic experience. Gambia, Lesotho, and Egypt are a few countries that took advantage of the grant program.  Egypt's athletes will spend two weeks at the Forum sports complex in Antrim, Northern Ireland. Gambia's Olympians will prepare for the Games at the University of York's Huntington Athletics Stadium.Eight Algerian boxers are making the trip to London, with Abdelhafid Benchebla leading his country's Olympic delegation. La Tribune is optimistic about the opportunity for the country to capture its first Olympic boxing gold medal since the 2000 Sydney Games but worries that the country does not invest in its sports representatives until it is too late to improve their performance. Olympic judo medalist Ammar Benyekhlef will miss the London Games because of passport problems. Algeria's Paralympians are also preparing for London. Earlier this week, the national goalball team participated in a Lithuanian hosted tournament featuring teams from Lithuania, Finland, Sweden, Turkey, Brazil, Belgium, the United States of America, and England.  The team coach Mohamed Bettahrat talked about the tournament, saying to the French language Algerian papaer La Tribune, "A new opportunity to work with the great nations offered to us to optimize our preparation for the upcoming Paralympic Games. This is a great tournament that brings together renowned this time, the selections that will be present in London, one of our group." tournament performance played a role in final team selection.  150 of Angola's Paralympic hopefuls were in Luanda this week competing in the national athletics championship hoping to earn a trip to the London Paralympics. For those qualified, they will then participate in a training camp starting on July 7 in Huíla before traveling to Portugal on July 14 ahead of the Games.  They then leave for London on August 4.Mandatory Bristol based training has been arranged by the National Olympic Committee of Kenya for nation's runners ahead of the Games but Kenya's runners have implied this will disrupt their preparations.  Middle-distance runner Silas Kiplagat is quoted in The Star of Nairobi in response to this mandate, "I'm not for the idea because all along, we have been training in high altitude and switching to the low altitude in Bristol is likely to be counter productive."   The Bristol idea is also opposed by Athletics Kenya, with the organization's chairman  Isaiah Kiplaga saying "The athletes have put in hard work for the last couple of months for the Olympic Games and Bristol being a low altitude area, it will hurt our medal hopes." Kenya's runners are expected to leave for London in two waves, with the first group leaving early next week and the second wave, which includes long distance runners, leaving closer to the start of the Games.This past Saturday, Kenya's Ezekiel Kemboi qualified for the London Games at the country's national championships but his trip to the Games may be in jeopardy as two days ago, he was accused of stabbing a woman in Eldoret. According to Capital FM, Team Kenya has yet to issue a formal response to the allegations.For two weeks, seven to nine Lesotho Olympians will prepare for the Games in north Wales, in Wrexham.  Local Welshmen have been recruited to assist Lesotho competitors in their preparations for the Games, with local organizers looking for potential sparring partners if Lesotho qualifies a boxer.  Two Lesotho marathon runners have already qualified. Swimmer Masempe Theko needs alternative arrangements because the Wrexham pool is only 25 meters, half the distance of the Olympic course pool.  What strokes Theko will compete in at the Games is still to be determined. At least two of Liberia's Olympians go into the Games having competed in their sports at universities in the United States. One attended University of Texas. Another, Jangy Addy, attended the University of Tennessee and will represent the country in the decathlon after having qualified for the event.Malawi Olympians will be headed to London with their national Olympic committee under a cloud, with the Nyasa Times alleging corruption in the contractor bidding process for facilities and other monetary handouts.  The Malawi delegation only manage to qualify its athletes through the Olympic solidarity movement, which allows athletes to compete by invitation after they failed to meet qualifying standards.  Fourteen year old Joyce Tafatatha and twenty-three-year old Charlton Nyirenda will represent the country in swimming. Neither swimmer has swum in a 50 meter pool before, practicing in a 25 meter unheated pool at home in Malawi.  Charlton goes into the game with a goal of breaking the Malawi record of 25.46 in the 50 meter freestyle swim.  Rounding out the Malawi competitors are marathoners John Kayange and Mike Tebulo, and Ambwene Simukonda who will compete in the 400 meter track event.   Arriving in London earlier this week, the team is training at University of Gloucestershire's Oxstalls campus. According to Nigeria Olympics Committee (NOC) President Sani Ndanusa, Nigeria's athletics competitors go into the Games with medal expectations.  In the lead up to London, the country's Olympic hopefuls participated in most of the major track competitions. The national Olympic Committee has until next week to finalize the list of track and field competitors they will send to London, but they have already made the decision to only send competitors who have made Olympic A qualifying times and scores. The Committee wants to avoid the embarassment of  Olympic B qualifying competitors doing poorly at the Games in front of a large population of Nigerians who live in the United Kingdom. One of the Nigerian Olympians has been able to prepare for the world stage by competing at University of Texas as an athlete. Nigeria's national football team does not have to worry about Olympic preparations as they failed to qualify for the Games in what is seen as a major blow to football in the country.Rwanda T46 Paralympic competitor Theoneste Nsengimana qualified for the Paralympic Games in the 1500 meter event this past Saturday following a 4.06.05 finish at the Belfort Championship in France.  In the process, he set a new national record for the distance in what was only his second international competition, with his first occurring last year at the All Africa Games held in Maputo, Mozambique.  Other Rwandan competitors who will join him in London include the national sitting volleyball team, power lifter Théogène Hakizimana and runner Hermas Cliff Muvunyi. South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius's Olympic 400 metre qualifying time efforts have yet to meet with success. At a qualifying race in Benin two days ago, he finished second in a qualifying heat with a time of 46.32 seconds, 1.2 seconds slower than than the required time. He missed the qualifying time again in yesterday's semi-final when he posted a time of 46.14 in another second place finish.  He has one more opportunity to qualify for the Games before Sunday, when the qualification window closes.

He has exactly the right attitude for the job."Scuderia Toro Rosso is part of the Red Bull stable, and is considered the ‘junior team’ to  Red Bull Sports Drink billionaire owner Dietrich Mateschitz’ primary Red Bull Racing F1 team. They recently picked up an option on Bourdais for 2008, an encouraging sign that the Frenchman may finally achieve his life-long goal of driving in F1. Toro Rosso is based on the former Minardi F1 team, a perennial back-marker but fan favorite. Minardi ex-owner Paul Stoddard now commandeers the new Team Minardi USA in Champ Car.Back in North America, Bourdais readies himself for the Rexall Grand Prix of Edmonton, in the unusual position of being third in points standings. Three DNF’s, stronger competition, and the parity that the new Panoz DP01 has brought to the series after the years of development that Bourdais’ team, Newman/Haas/Lanigan lavished on the previous Lola chassis had given them an on-track advantage, has resulted in Bourdais scrambling to claim his fourth consecutive title and the accompanying Vanderbilt Cup, before presumably heading off to F1.Andre Agassi and Maria Sharapova have been voted the sexiest Wimbledon champions from the last twenty years according to a survey conducted by the U.K. commercial website GetMeATicket.Agassi and received 77% of the votes as the sexiest champion amongst names such as Boris Becker and John McEnroe.

Today the name of Iran is synonymous with prestige, justice seeking, monotheism, anti-despotism, and the entire blessed values that are dear for the world nations," he continued.An Irish journalist, Rory Fitzgerald, wrote a satirical piece in response to the president's remarks. "A visibly shaken Paul spoke out earlier today saying: 'As an octopus, I can claim some objectivity in my view [of] human affairs,' " Fitzgerald wrote.Paul correctly predicted the outcome of Germany's seven matches and picked Spain over the Netherlands for the World Cup final.

Ingram's father played football for nine years in the NFL and was the 28th overall pick in the  1987 NFL Draft.On the opening Texas possession, an injury to Texas starting quarterback Colt McCoy, who left the game, put true freshman Gilbert in charge of the Longhorn's offense.After the game, McCoy told ESPN that he "[...] would haven given anything to be out there with [his] team."The game, held annually in Pasadena, California, is the final college American football game in the country determines the national champion for the previous year's regular season.

In an investigation carried by The Telegraph correspondents, Sam Allardyce negotiated a deal worth £400,000 (about US$520,000) with supposed businessmen to bypass FA rules on the summer player-transfer market.Representing an imaginary company based in the Far East, the investigators, portraying themselves as businessmen, sought evidence of corruption in English football. In discussion with them, Allardyce said some agents evade the FA rules, introduced in 2008, preventing a third party from owning a player. Allardyce called these rules "ridiculous".Allardyce criticised his predecessor Hodgson and his assistant Gary Neville. He said Hodgson was an ineffective public speaker because he lacked "personality". Of Neville, Allardyce commented he should have been asked to "sit down and shut up". He said the national team should not select players who are not played by their clubs. He also added that the English players under Hodgson were not up to their potential because they were unable to cope psychologically.He said the FA is "stupid" to spend money redeveloping the Wembly Stadium. He said, "They [the FA] stupidly spent £870 million on Wembley, so they're still paying that debt off. [...] If they'd built it anywhere else, it would have cost about £400 million".Allardyce apologised to the FA and said, "Although it was made clear during the recorded conversations that any proposed arrangements would need the FA's full approval, I recognize I made some comments which have caused embarrassment. [...] I also regret my comments with regard to other individuals".The English FA announced current England U-21 manager Gareth Southgate would be the interim national team manager for upcoming games against Malta, Slovenia, Scotland, and Spain. Allardyce's spell lasted for only 67 days, making him the shortest serving manager for the Three Lions. Allardyce managed England for only one game which was a 1–0 victory against Slovakia.Fernando Alonso became the first Spaniard to win the FIA Formula-1 Spanish Grand Prix. Unlike in the previous race, this time, Michael Schumacher placed third after the qualification on Saturday. Giancarlo Fisicella, Alonso's teammate, started second, thus completing the front row by Renault. Two Ferrari cars occupied the second row.In the race, which took place in Barcelona, Montmello circuit de Catalunya, Schumacher struck hard to overtake Renault drivers, but finished with this goal half done. Unable to compete with Alonso's speed, he easily overtook Fisico after the first pit stop.As said by the winner about his own speed, he "controlled the second part of the race" and slowed down because of the huge gap between him and his closest competitor, Michael Schumacher.Although he set the fastest lap in the race, this time, Felipe Massa did not have enough pace to overtake Fisicella, thus completing the race on the fourth place. Kimi Räikkönen did not struggle as much with the other drivers as he did with his own car and finished fifth. All the other competitors, except for the sixth place Jenson Button, finished with a gap more than a lap.In the drivers' championship, Fernando Alonso won back 2 points from Michael Schumacher and now has a 15-point lead.On Thursday, FC Barcelona technical secretary Robert Fernández announced Brazillian football defender Dani Alves would leave the club this summer as a free agent.Alves spent eight seasons with the Catalonians when the club signed him from Sevilla FC. Making his debut for Barça in 2008, Alves played 391 matches and he played the second most games of any foreign player in the Catalan jersey after Lionel Messi. In his last league appearance for Barça, he provided an assist to Luis Suárez which was Alves's 100th assist in La Liga.Alves won 23 trophies with Barclona — six La Liga, four Copa del Rey, four Supercopa de España, three UEFA Champions League, three UEFA Super Cups and three FIFA Club World Cups.Last season Alves extended his contract, as FC Barcelona had a transfer ban imposed by FIFA. Robert Fernández said in the press conference that Aleix Vidal was signed with awareness of Alves's possible departure. He also said, "This is personal decision that the club has to accept".Alves posted on Instagram saying, "I'm privileged, a hard-working and honourable footballer who's been lucky enough to wear the shirt of the best club in the world in a wonderful decade for the club thanks to the quality of its players and coaches" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Soy un privilegiado, un futbolista trabajador y honrado, a quién la vida le ha permitido vestir la camiseta del mejor club del mundo en una década prodigiosa por la calidad de sus jugadores y entrenadores.FC Barcelona has invited him to address club supporters at the 2016–17 season start in farewell.File:America's Cup.jpgThe Swiss yachting team, Alinghi, have defeated Team New Zealand in the fifth race for the 32nd America's Cup. The overall score is now 3-2 to Alinghi.Alinghi won the race by 19 seconds, though throughout the pre-start race each yacht was within close distance of each other. Team New Zealand, racing with NZL-92, crossed the start line first and reached a 12 second lead at the first mark. But when Team New Zealand were preparing to fly a new kite, their spinnaker ripped in two and went flying into the air. Their second spinnaker was not tied on properly and the third one got tangled half way up.Team New Zealand managed to free the first two and untangle the third to continue the race, making up some of the 140 metres Alinghi had created in the three minute hold up.Grant Dalton, managing director of Team New Zealand, said, "That was an important race and it wasn't one we should have lost on a mistake on a move we've practised time and again."The team first to five wins, wins the "Auld Mug".The Switzerland-based yachting team, Alinghi have defeated Team New Zealand to bring their overall wins to four, with New Zealand left on two wins. If Alinghi wins the next race, they will win the "Auld Mug", which they currently hold.Alinghi crossed the line 28 seconds before Team New Zealand, despite having winds favourable to Team New Zealand, 8-9 knots.Head of Alinghi, Ernesto Bertarelli said, "We only have one to go but it's going to be as hard as all the others."Yesterday's race was filled with flaws with Team New Zealand having trouble with spinnakers. This race was the opposite, Team New Zealand yachting without flaw, and leading for much of the race. At the first mark, Team New Zealand led by 14 seconds. Though SUI-100, skippered by New Zealander Brad Butterworth, managed to overtake NZL-92, skippered by Dean Barker, to get a 28 second lead by the end of the race.During the pre-start race, Team New Zealand crossed in front of the path of Alinghi, leading to a denied appeal by Butterworth. Neither team led the start of the race.Yachties and sport commentators have labelled the challenge for the 32nd America's Cup the most exciting ever. Defeating the trend of whoever leads the start of the race firsts, wins the race.Managing director of Team New Zealand, Grant Dalton had previously ruled out crew changes for the next race if such a scenario was to present itself in the future.The next race, and the possible final race, will be on Sunday.In 2003, when Team New Zealand was defending the America's Cup in Auckland, New Zealand, Alinghi were the victors, becoming the first European team to win the "Auld Mug".File:America's Cup.jpgAlinghi has defeated Team New Zealand by one second in the seventh race to win the 32nd America's Cup in a close run race. The final score was five wins for Alinghi and two for Team New Zealand in the best of nine challenge.Skipper Brad Butterworth, coincidently a New Zealander, led the Switzerland-based boat to a second straight "Auld Mug" trophy.The race started with Team New Zealand, skippered by Dean Barker, having a slight advantage. This was soon lost to Alinghi however, ending the first mark with a seven second lead. Nearing the end of the second mark, Team New Zealand managed to overtake Alinghi to gain a 14 second lead.However, when SUI-100 were catching up to NZL-92, Team New Zealand were penalised for port-starboard incident. Team New Zealand then lost the lead.Coming up to the final leg of the race, Team New Zealand managed to take a 70 metre lead after the wind faded, and both yachts had dropped their spinnakers and Alinghi dropped into a hole. Team New Zealand still had to complete their 360 degree penalty turn, and did so. After completing the turn, Alinghi sailed up beside them and took the win by one second.Swiss President Micheline Calmy-Rey congratulated the team, sending a telegram that read: "We Swiss find our way at sea, not just in the mountains."Micheline Calmy-Rey, president of Switzerland, sent a telegram to the team congratulating them of their win. "We Swiss find our way at sea, not just in the mountains," referring to Switzerland being most popular for Alpine skiing.Managing director of Team New Zealand, Grant Dalton, said, "All credit to Alinghi. They kept it close when we got past them on the first run they just kept on sailing the way they do and beat us fair and square in the end.""It don’t think the margin today really matters. They still won it."The New Zealand Government has announced that it is setting aside NZ$10 million to help retain key yachties. This is just under double what the government gave them after the loss in 2003.Sports and recreation minister for New Zealand, Trevor Mallard, said, "It is the view of the government that the team should continue, that it should be based in New Zealand and that Auckland should host an America's Cup regatta again."The Swiss syndicate, Alinghi has won the first race against Team New Zealand over the challenge for the top yachting award, the 32nd America's Cup. Alinghi finished the race 35 seconds ahead of Team New Zealand.In the first race of a best out of nine challenge, Alinghi and Team New Zealand started at an even pace. Team New Zealand managed to edge out 25 metres in front of Alinghi on the right hand side of the course, which Team New Zealand chose by winning the coin toss.Team New Zealand skipper, Dean Barker said that the right hand side was the better side at the start of the race. But the wind changed and favoured Alinghi on the left hand side.But ten minutes through the race, Alinghi's SUI-100, skippered by New Zealander Brad Butterworth, managed to head out, at times 160 metres in front of NZL-92."It felt really good – it was a huge relief to get out there. The racing was close, but we were pretty calm...," Alinghi trimmer Simon Daubney said.The wind speeds were around 12.5 knots, with Alinghi grinder, Matt Welling describing the conditions as washing machine like. It has been reported that Team New Zealand modified their yacht, NZL-92, for choppy conditions.Barker, Team New Zealand weather checker, Adam Beashell, and Daubney agree that SUI-100 isn't faster than NZL-92, and New Zealand could win in different conditions. Barker said, "You certainly couldn't blame it on our boat. We are very happy with it. It was just the way the breeze blew today. They are a very strong opponent and they got in front and controlled the race well." Daubney said, "The boat speed is pretty similar between the two, but it was puffy and the breeze was up and down, so you can’t get too much of a read on it in just one race. From a first look though, it seems the boats are pretty similar in speed."Team New Zealand mastman, Barry McKay said the Team New Zealand will bounce back and carry on, a view also shared by Team New Zealand after-guard, Rob Salthouse.In the last America's Cup challenge, 2003, Alinghi defeated Team New Zealand 5-0, though in 1995 and 2000, Team New Zealand defeated Alinghi.Around 800 boats of different sizes and types gathered on the Mediterranean Sea to watch the first race.Team New Zealand won the right to challenge Alinghi for the cup after defeating Luna Rossa Challenge five-nil for the Louis Vuitton Cup.File:America's Cup.jpgThe seventh race in the challenge for the 32nd America's Cup has been postponed due to unfair and unstable race conditions. This race could have been the last and final race as Alinghi are currently on match point on four wins, while Team New Zealand are only on two wins in the best of nine competition.At 12.30 a.m. (NZST) there was already speculation gathering that there could be a delay due to the wind being all over the place. The principal race officer also confirmed that there was a very real possibility that there would be a delay.The delayed flag was flown at 12.55 a.m., five minutes before the yachting race was due to begin. This was due to unstable weather conditions, which could lead to an unfair race.At 1.20 a.m., 20 minutes after the race was scheduled to start, there had still been no word from the race committee on a possible racing time. The wind speeds were around five knots near the starting line, but the wind direction still wasn't stable and fair.The wind speed was starting to get higher into more acceptable conditions with the wind at the start line around seven knots. But the wind direction was still unstable.At 2.10 a.m., the principal race officer announced that there would be "no more racing today". Tomorrow is a guaranteed rest day, so the next possible day for racing will be early Wednesday morning (NZST).During this America's Cup challenge and other previous ones, discussion has been raised that a new boat design is needed, as to make the race more interesting with faster boats and more takeovers throughout the race.It was also Grant Dalton's, managing director of Team New Zealand, 50th birthday.Team New Zealand have defeated Swiss syndicate Alinghi in the second race of the 32nd America's Cup Challenge on Sunday, making the overall score equal with one win for each team.Team New Zealand, racing with NZL-92, crossed the start line three seconds ahead of Alinghi's yacht, SUI-100. But Alinghi led the race at the first mark by 13 seconds, though near the ending of the race, Team New Zealand managed to overtake Alinghi to lead the final leg of the race by 28 seconds.Former Alinghi and Team New Zealand skipper, Russell Coutts said that the latest win for Team New Zealand will act as a big boost for them. Ray Davis, Team New Zealand after-guard, said, "It’s been huge for the team to get a win on the board in the America’s Cup. It has been a long time coming for Emirates Team New Zealand."Dan Cowie, Team New Zealand trimmer, said, "As we said yesterday there are two very even boats out there. We didn’t learn a whole lot more today."The next race is scheduled for tomorrow, Monday being a race-off day.The last time Alinghi and Team New Zealand fought for the America's Cup was when Team New Zealand was defending the trophy in Auckland, New Zealand.The past three consecutive America's Cup challenges have been all whitewash victories, and five of the last six challenges have also been whitewashes.File:America's Cup.jpgTeam New Zealand have won the third yacht race in the bid for America's Cup, beating the defending champion, Swiss syndicate Alinghi. Sport commentators and yachties are describing the win as one of the greatest races in the history of the Cup.Team New Zealand finished the race 25 seconds ahead of Alinghi, despite the leader changing three times throughout the race. This new win for Team New Zealand puts the overall score at 2 wins for Team New Zealand and one win for Alinghi. The winner of the America's Cup will be the first to reach five wins.By the first mark of the race, Team New Zealand had a lead of one minute and 23 seconds. However, at this turn, their spinnaker got caught in the genoa gear and Richard Meacham, mid bowman, almost went over board. Due to this mistake, Alinghi were able to catch up and lead the second mark by 15 seconds. Grant Dalton, head of Team New Zealand, said, "The trouble we had at the leeward mark let [Alinghi] back into the race and [Team New Zealand] paid the price."But Team New Zealand managed to win, 25 seconds in front. Team New Zealand navigator Kevin Hall said, "My heart rate would be doing about 180 right now but it's nice to be towing in and looking at them back there instead of in front of us like they were in the second beat."The head of Alinghi, Ernesto Bertarelli, believes that the race committee should not have started the race, which it did so at 4:59 p.m.. The race cannot be announced after 5.00 p.m.. "We waited for two hours..."Team New Zealand strategist Ray Davies said, "There was certainly a bit of dice rolling."President of the Nelson Marlborough Yachting Association Doug Mckee described the race as the most exciting one since Australia winning the America's Cup when the Australians won the Auld Mug from the New York Yacht Club who had held it for 132 years. "We are definitely good enough to win the cup."Hall said, "It probably hasn't happened very often that you see three passes in an America's Cup race. It's a testament to the strength of both teams."The wind speed was around 8–9 knots.Alinghi beat Team New Zealand in 2003, also winning the America's Cup in Auckland, New Zealand.American Alpine ski racer James Heuga has died at the age of 66. Heuga won a bronze medal at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck.Richard Rokos, a coach who helped Heuga with his training in his later years commented on his death. He said "He tried to do his best, and when he didn't do as well as he was hoping for, he was disappointed. He couldn't walk, he couldn't run, he couldn't do anything else, but this was the way he could present himself as a competitive athlete. An icon is gone”.Heuga competed for the United States at the 1964 Winter Olympics. He won a bronze medal in the slalom with a time of 2.11.52. Heuga, along with Billy Kidd who won silver in the same event became the first Americans to win a medal in Alpine ski racing. Forced to retire early from competitive sport due to multiple sclerosis, Heuga continued to train as an athlete. In 1984 he opened up the Jimmie Heuga Center to help sufferers with multiple sclerosis. Billy Kidd, whom he shared the podium with at the 1964 games, said “Obviously, the world knew him for his accomplishments as a ski racer, but I admire him even more because of how he led his life, especially with the challenges of MS.” He is survived by his four children.Track star Marion Jones, winner of 3 gold medals in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, has tested positive for the performance enhancing drug, EPO. The hormone helps create extra red blood cells which allows the user's body to absorb extra oxygen.  Jones was expected to compete in yesterday's Golden League meet in Zurich, Switzerland, but left early in the morning for "personal reasons." It was announced earlier today (UTC) that she had tested positive for EPO. Jones faces a two year ban if her B test sample comes back positive.Jones has a history of association with steroid users and dealers. In 1999, her then husband CJ Hunter tested positive for a similar drug, nandralone. He had to withdraw from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and received a two year ban.  Jones later divorced him, and in 2002 started a relationship with another track star, Tim Montgomery, who were both coached by Trevor Grahm.Montgomery set a record in the 100 meter sprint of 9.78 seconds at a race in Paris that year. He was banned for two years and stripped of his record due to evidence in the Federal BALCO investigation. In the BALCO investigation, several witnesses stated that Marion Jones was taking banned substances received from BALCO. Jones' coach, Grahm, has been involved with 10 other athletes that tested positive and were ultimately banned for the use of illegal substances. Justin Gatlin, also coached by Grahm, also tested positive for artificial Testosterone, but has not been banned or stripped of his record. Another American athlete, cyclist Floyd Landis tested positive for excessive levels of adrenaline after winning the Tour-de-France, which may lead to him being the first winner in the tournament's history to be stripped of the title.American Major League Baseball third baseman Alex Rodriguez, a star player for the New York Yankees, admitted in an interview on sports network ESPN that he used performance-enhancing drugs during 2001 through 2003."I did take a banned substance, and for that, I'm very sorry," Rodriguez told ESPN's Peter Gammons. "When I arrived at Texas in 2001 I felt an enormous amount of pressure to perform."Last week, Sports Illustrated reported that the baseball player, nicknamed 'A-Rod', tested positive in 2003 for Primobolan and testosterone, two substances that have been banned by the league.During the 2003 season, Rodriguez was playing with the Texas Rangers, and was the winner of the American League MVP Award and was American League leader in home runs. According to sources, Rodriguez was one of 104 players named on a list for testing positive before the 2003 season. The list was compiled in an attempt to determine whether the MLB needed to begin conducting random drug testing.After the initial report Rodriguez was approached by Sports Illustrated while he was training for the upcoming season in a Miami area gym. At that time, Rodriguez told the reporter "You'll have to talk to the union." He was also asked for an explanation of his positive test result, to which he commented "I'm not saying anything." According to a report by ESPN, sources claim that Rodriguez was aware that he tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.However, in December 2007 after United States Senator George J. Mitchell's Mitchell Report was released accusing such teammates of Rodriguez as Roger Clemens, Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte of steroid use, Rodriguez appeared on ABC's 60 Minutes and declined the use of any steroid or performance-enhancing drug. He also commented that he would not need the help of steroids, stating, "I've never felt overmatched on the baseball field. I felt that if I did my, my work as I've done since I was, you know, a rookie back in Seattle, I didn't have a problem competing at any level."Senator Mitchell stated in a prepared comment yesterday that his report had only named that players that "had received credible evidence of their illegal purchase, possession, or use of performance enhancing substances." He pointed out that he "did not have access to the results of the 2003 drug testing, and to this day I do not know which players tested positive then."The MLB declined to comment directly on the situation due to court orders on the list of names and documents, but did release a statement: "Information and documents relating to the results of the 2003 MLB testing program are both confidential and under seal by court orders. We are prohibited from confirming or denying any allegation about the test results of any particular player by the court orders. Anyone with knowledge of such documents who discloses their contents may be in violation of those court orders."Rodriguez has been one of the many prominent American baseball players over the past few years who has been linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Other prominent names include both the arguably greatest hitter and pitcher in Major League Baseball history, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. Bonds, the all-time Major League record holder for home runs, was linked to steroid use during the BALCO scandal in 2003, while Clemens was named in the Mitchell report in December of 2007.The executive vice president for labor relations of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, stated that league commissioner Bud Selig was "disturbed" by the linking of steroid use to Rodriguez. Commenting for the league, he said, "Because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we cannot make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named."The report by Sports Illustrated also made the claim that Gene Orza, the COO of the Major League Baseball Players Association informed Rodriguez of a random drug test that occurred in September of 2004, a test that was supposed to remain confidential to all players. The MLBPA denied the accusations, commenting "There was no improper tipping of players in 2004 about the timing of drug tests. In September 2004 MLBPA attorneys met with certain players, but we are not able to confirm or deny the names of any players with whom we met." When asked in the Sports Illustrated report, Orza declined to comment, stating "I'm not interested in discussing this information with you."The anonymous testing of players was started in 2003 by the MLB, in order to get a brief estimate of how many players were using performance-enhancing drugs, leading to the beginning of the mandatory, penalty-enforced testing that began in 2004. 1,198 players took the "survey test" in 2003, and the results were later stored in a laboratory in Las Vegas, with codes being used in place of the players names. However, a list of the players actual names that went with the list of codes was kept in a separate office in Long Beach, never intended to ever be together with the codes.In April 2004, federal agents with search warrants raided the two labs looking for information on the 2003 BALCO scandal test results of 10 players, including Barry Bonds. While searching, they found both the list of names and the codes, including the positive test result of Rodriguez. Following the investigation and raid, the MLBPA informed all 104 players on the list that their positive test data had been sized by the federal agents.Former Major League Baseball star and self-confessed steroid user José Canseco told the media that the news was old, saying "I said in my book Vindicated that he was a known steroid user before 2000. It's old news. I've been saying this forever. You guys are playing catch-up." In the book, Canseco links Rodriguez to steroids through the claim that he saw him using the drugs. In his first book, Juiced, references to Rodriguez were removed by the publisher of the book because it could not be confirmed that Canseco actually saw Rodriguez taking steroids. According to the publisher, it was only after Canseco passed a lie detector test that information about Rodriguez was allowed into Vindicated.Current senior advisor to the Texas Rangers John Hart commented on the situation in an interview with MLB Network. "I think in the climate that we have today, you don't have much shock anymore. Obviously Alex probably is the best player in baseball. This has always been a special talent and the guy has been putting up Hall of Fame numbers since the day he showed up in the big leagues. I've been in the game for almost 40 years and it hurts a little bit, if in fact this is true. It breaks my heart for the game that we have this kind of thing occurring, But at the same time, a lot of people seem to have been caught in this net," he said. Since the positive test occurred in 2003 before penalties were instituted, Rodriguez will most likely not be suspended by the MLB as a result of the situation.The second urine sample provided by the winner of this year's Tour de France, American cyclist Floyd Landis, has tested positive for excessive levels of testosterone. This confirms the results of the earlier test done after his victory in the Tour de France on 20 July. The International Cycling Union said: "The UCI communicates that the analysis of the sample B of Floyd Landis's urine has confirmed the result of an adverse analytical finding notified by the anti-doping laboratory of Paris on July 26, following the analysis of the sample A.". Landis now faces the prospect of being stripped of his title, along with the possibility of a two year ban.He also stands to lose $575,700 in prize money. This would be the first time a winner has been disqualified for doping in the Tour's history. The American has refuted the charges saying his body naturally produces high levels of testosterone. In its comment about Landis sample analyses, the USA Cycling announced that it will "refer this case to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) as the organization solely responsible for the adjudication of anti-doping cases involving American athletes in the Olympic movement"The Phonak team fired Landis on Saturday for "violating the teams internal Code of Ethics", a statement released by the team said.Oscar Pereiro Sio who finished second, 57 seconds adrift, now claims himself the true Tour de France champion after hearing about Landis' result. [1]Since 1984 testosterone use is forbidden, but difficult to test for because the body produces it naturally. A test involves measuring the testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio. An average caucasian has a 1:1 ratio but it is tolerated up to 4:1 (ratio was 6:1 or even 10:1 in the past). A new test using a spectrometer and carbon 13  ratio (CIR) exists. This new test gives a more accurate result for the presence of synthetic testosterone. This test was used on Floyd's samples in order to confirm synthetic testosterone in his blood.University of Michigan Wolverines head coach Lloyd Carr, who had coached the college football program for thirteen years, announced his retirement from the coaching profession, effective after the Wolverines' bowl game."Yesterday was one of the most emotional days of my life," Carr said at his press conference, referring to when he informed his team of his retirement. "I’ve cried more tears than I knew I had. I’ve never laughed so hard in my life. There’s so many memories. It was a wonderful day."During his tenure at Michigan, Carr won five Big Ten Conference championships and a national championship in 1997. He had a disappointing 1-6 record vs. Jim Tressel's Ohio State Buckeyes, though his overall record vs. Ohio State was 6-7. Carr's last victory over Ohio State came in 2003. He amassed a 121-40 overall record while at Michigan and ranks seventh among active coaches with a 75.2 winning percentage.There has been a lot of speculation, even before Carr's retirement, regarding who would become the next Michigan head coach. Current Louisiana State University head coach Les Miles is viewed as the top candidate to replace Carr.Observers see Les Miles as the front-runner despite his recent comments. "I want to stay just where I’m at," Miles said. "I don’t want to think about it. Don’t want to envision it. I want to go forward and prepare."Vernon Bellecourt, once the primary spokesperson for the American Indian Movement, died recently at age 75. Bellecourt, an Ojibwa who fought for Native rights, was perhaps best known for his opposition to Native names and mascots for sports teams.First in the headlines in 1972, Bellecourt organized a cross-country caravan of the Movement, to Washington. Once there, members of the group occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. His goal of international recognition for Aboriginal nations and their treaties found him meeting with figures like Libyan Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi, and Palestine's Yasir Arafat. In 1977 Leonard Peltier was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the murder of two FBI Agents during a 1975 shoot-out on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation; Bellecourt led the campaign to free him.Most recently, he visited Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, to discuss getting free or cheap heating oil for reservations.His work as president of the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and Media made a much wider known mark, though. Bellecourt emphasized that he believed such names perpetuated racial stereotypes, clouding the real identities and problems facing natives.Teams with native-related names could almost guarantee on Bellecourt showing up at major games. He twice burned an effigy of Chief Wahoo, the Cleveland Indians baseball team mascot, and both times was arrested. When the Washington Redskins of the National Football League made the Super Bowl, Vernon was there to protest. The United States Commission on Civil Rights was critical of such names by 2001, calling them "insensitive in light of the long history of forced assimilation". Some newspapers have stopped using the names of teams with Native origins.None of his "big four" targets have shown any indication of changing: the Washington Redskins, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Cleveland Indians or the Atlanta Braves.Post-season use of American Indian mascots were banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2005, suggesting the names are "hostile or abusive". Bellecourt was pleased with the NCAA sanctions, but suggested such actions were only going "half way".The Florida State Seminole and the Illinois Illini were among the 18 colleges affected by the ban. Florida president T.K. Wetherell threatened legal action in response. The Florida Seminole tribes have endorsed the University's usage of the name, but some out-of-state tribes were "not supportive", according to the NCAA vice president for diversity and inclusion.Born WaBun-Inini, Bellecourt died from complications of pneumonia on October 13, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.Karl Von Hess, the American professional wrestler whose wrestling persona was that of a Nazi sympathiser has died at the age of 90. The cause of death was linked to a battle with Alzheimer’s disease which he had battled in recent years. Born as Francis Faketty he first trained as a lifeguard and began to teach swimming. He joined the U.S Navy and served in World War II. After completing his service he began to train as a wrestler. He tried several gimmicks before coming up with the Von Hess gimmick. He took his idea off of Kurt Von Poppenheim who has a less sinister German gimmick. Fakerry legally changed his name to Karl Von Hess and was signed by the WWWF, later the WWF. He was so convincing as a heel that people tried to stab and attack him. His gimmick became so controversial that promoter Vince McMahon had to calm matters by doing an interview with the Washington Post. He said that “Von Hess is no Nazi. He uses that silly salute to point up the act that he is the villain".Von Hess defended his choice of gimmick saying, "It was right after the war and I had tried everything.  I played different characters, and then I came up with this gimmick of Von Hess and I played it right to the hilt."  Von Hess began to draw big crowds until the early 1960s when his gimmick began to wear thin; he was phased out of the WWWF in the late 60’s. WWE Hall of Fame member Johnny Rodz called Von Hess his favourite heel saying that "He was the meanest. Who the heck comes to the ring and breaks the steps before you get in the ring? What gives a guy that reason?"After leaving the WWWF he had several stints with other promotions but then retired. He opened several trailer parks and other businesses with his wife who died in 2005.Former professional wrestler Mike Shaw has died at the age of 53.  His death was announced by a family friend.  Shaw was most famously known for his time with the the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), as Bastion Booger.  The cause of death was announced as a heart attack.During the course of Shaw's wrestling career he had several gimmicks including Makhan Singh, Friar Ferguson, and Norman the Lunatic, although Shaw is most famously remembered for his gimmick of the Bastion Booger, an overweight man with bad hygiene.  After working for local wrestling promotions and World Championship Wrestling, Shaw joined the WWF.  Bastion Booger was one of his gimmicks while wrestling for the WWF.In an interview with wrestling journalist Scott Teal in 1998, Shaw said "I think the Booger character would have worked if it got over as a heel, but my heart wasn't into it. I didn't like the character. I didn't like the outfit. Don't get me wrong. I was happy to be in the WWF. It was something I wanted to do my whole career. I made a good living there." After leaving the WWF, Shaw retired from active wrestling.  Thereafter he ran his own wrestling school.  He made an appearance on WWE Raw on December 10, 2007 to take part in the show's fifteenth anniversary.Shaw is survived by his wife and two children.Barbaro, winner of the 2006 Kentucky Derby, was euthanized on the morning of January 29, according to co-owner Roy Jackson. Barbaro suffered a major injury to his right hind leg shortly after the start of the 2006 Preakness Stakes.According to Jackson, "We just reached a point where it was going to be difficult for him to go on without pain. It was the right decision, it was the right thing to do. We said all along if there was a situation where it would become more difficult for him then it would be time."Barbaro's right hind leg was shattered in the opening lengths of the Preakness race. Three bones in the leg were broken - the cannon bone, the sesamoid bone, and the pastern bone. Laminitis took hold in the left hind leg as a result of the extra weight borne on the leg by the horse. It appeared for a while that Barbaro would recover; however, earlier this month, the horse suffered two significant setbacks that greatly reduced his ultimate chances for survival.The three-year-old colt underwent emergency surgery on May 20 to fuse two joints in the damaged right leg. Further surgery was required on January 27 to insert two steel pins into one of the healed bones. The latest procedure was especially risky because it because it transferred more weight on to the leg, with the foot resting on the ground not bearing any weight. The right rear hoof was already deteriorating, having developed a painful abscess earlier in the week.U.S. Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps has apologized to fans following tabloid pictures of him smoking a marijuana pipe.The 23-year-old multiple gold medalist was pictured yesterday in the British Sunday newspaper The News of the World apparently using a "bong" at a University of South Carolina party he attended whilst visiting a friend on November 6, 2008. He released a statement on his Facebook wall, saying "I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment."The statement said "I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me. For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public - it will not happen again."Marijuana is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) when athletes are actually competing, but not outside of that. Phelps therefore is unlikely to face sanctions from WADA because of the incident. However,  US swimming officials and Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), the international swimming federation, will comment later on their thoughts about the incident. FINA banned Gary Hall for three months in 1998 for marijuana use.Phelps has never failed a drugs test in his career and has previously volunteered for extra testing as part of the sport's campaign against performance enhancing drugs. He does, however, have a conviction for drunken driving gained when he was 19. Phelps was named as the U.S. Olympic Committee's male athlete of the year last week and was also Sports Illustrated magazine's "Sportsman of the Year" in 2008. He has endorsement contracts with Speedo, Visa, Guitar Hero and Frosted Flakes.Andre Agassi retired after a defeat by Benjamin Becker of Germany at the U.S. Open. The score was 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5.After the match ended, Thirty six year old Agassi sobbed as the 24,000 fans gave him a standing ovation lasting four minutes."The scoreboard said I lost today, but what the scoreboard doesn't say is what it is I've found," Agassi told the crowd, tears streaming down his cheeks, his voice cracking with emotion. "Over the last 21 years, I've found loyalty. You have pulled for me on the court and also in life. I have found inspiration. You have willed me to succeed sometimes even in my lowest moments."Agassi had a 21-Year Tennis Career. In all he won four Australian Opens (1995, 2000, 2001 and 2003), two US Opens (1994 and 1999), one Wimbledon (1992) and one French Open (1999). He was also World No.1 on several occasions. Recently, he had been increasingly crippled by a bulging disc in his lower back in the last 18 months and announced on June 24 that this was his farewell tournament.Two relatives of a coach for the American Volleyball team, and their tour-guide, were attacked by a knife-wielding Chinese man Saturday.Todd and Barbara Bachman of Farmington, Minnesota USA, in-laws of Hugh McCutcheon- head U.S. indoor men’s volleyball coach, were touring the Drum Tower in central Beijing when the attack occurred. Mr. Bachman was killed, his wife and their tour-guide were injured and are undergoing treatment at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.Elisabeth Bachman McCutcheon, wife of Hugh McCutcheon and a member of the 2004 United States women’s Olympics volleyball team, was also present for the attack on her parents, but was herself uninjured.The attacker, identified by Chinese state sources as Tang Yongming, a 47 year old from  Hangzhou, Zhejiang leapt to his death from the tower's second story in what was labeled a suicide.A United States Olympic Committee spokesman stated that the victims weren't wearing anything that might have marked them as Americans or as associated with a US team. He further stated that it wasn't known whether the U.S. men's volleyball team would compete in a match scheduled for Sunday and that no extra security was planned for U.S. athletes.U.S. President George W. Bush and his wife Laura were in the city for the Olympic games. Mr. Bush stated, “Laura and I were also saddened by the attack on an American family and their Chinese tour guide today in Beijing. The United States government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs.”Todd Bachman was the CEO of Bachman's, Inc; a regional chain of garden centers based in Minneapolis. He was sixty-two years old.French  tennis champion  Amélie Mauresmo yesterday won her first  Grand Slam title at the  Australian Open in  Melbourne. Mauresmo was winning 6-1 2-0 when her opponent,  Belgian player  Justine Henin-Hardenne, retired, citing a stomach complaint.After winning a rally in the second game of the second set, Henin-Hardenne approached the umpire and complained of feeling unwell. She then consulted her trainer before returning to the court. After losing two points, she approached the net and told Mauresmo she was too ill to continue, ending the game in 52 minutes.Henin-Hardenne apologized to her opponent, the tournament organisers and a disappointed crowd of 15,452 people. “I’m feeling very disappointed for sure to end the tournament this way. I am feeling very sick and couldn’t stay longer and continue,” she said.She later told a press conference that she believed  anti-inflammatory medication she had been taking for a shoulder injury had made her feel ill and left her with no energy. “I felt it when I woke up, but I tried. I knew at the beginning of the match that I could not win it,” she said.Henin-Hardenne’s retirement gave Mauresmo her third victory by default in the tournament. She reached the fourth round after Dutch player  Michaella Krajicek retired with  heat exhaustion. In the semi-final, Mauresmo was again the beneficiary of a retirement when Belgian player Kim Clijsters retired with an ankle injury.Until now, 26-year-old Mauresmo was the only former world no.1 to never have won a  Grand Slam  title. She said in a post-match interview that when she returns home to her base in  Geneva, Switzerland, she will toast the win with a bottle of 1937  Château d'Yquem wine which she has been saving to celebrate her first grand slam title.“I bought a bottle about three or four years ago. Very good one. Very old one also. I keep it. I thought, "You know, this one is going to be for my Grand Slam, my first Grand Slam title,"" she said.Mauresmo’s win comes seven years after the then  unseeded player reached the 1999 Australian Open final, the last time she has reached a Grand Slam final. She lost to  Martina Hingis and was berated by the press and several players for her muscular build and for acknowledging her then partner, Sylvie Bourdon, believing if they were open about their relationship, people would be less inclined to gossip. At the time, Lindsay Davenport complained that playing Mauresmo was like playing against a male player. While Martina Hingis accused her of being “half a man.”Henin-Hardenne’s retirement is the first time a player has retired from a women’s Grand Slam final since  Brazil’s Maria Bueno retired in 1966 during a final against Australia’s Margaret Smith Court.Mauresmo is now ranked world no.2 and is the first Frenchwoman to win an Australian Open since Mary Pierce won in 1995. Mauresmo takes home the Australian Open trophy and prize money of $AU1,220,000, while Henin-Hardenne walked away with the runner-up prize money of $AU610,000.Anaheim wins series 4-1.

The site even says "don't forget a gold medal will be given for the most damage at a single location."There was no explanation on the site, as to why Royal Bank was targeted.The bank has supported the Canadian Olympic Movement for 60 years. The RBC Olympians Program was created in 2002, and among the 35 athletes it has supported are diving bronze medalist Blythe Hartley, Jennifer Botterill from the gold-winning women's ice hockey team, and athlete Perdita Felicien. This year, the program is sponsoring a total of 28 summer and winter athletes.Opposition to the 2010 Olympics has focused on the $1.63 billion expense for taxpayers, destruction of natural habitat, and loss of low-income housing to support a fee-based recreational event.Munich-based football club Bayern Munich yesterday announced their current manager Pep Guardiola would remain only to this season's end. Former Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti would replace the Spaniard next season. Bayern under Guardiola won back-to-back Bundesliga titles and one German Cup since summer of 2013.

A minutes silence was held at 15:06 in Liverpool, Nottingham and Sheffield.In the 20 years that have passed but the families of the victims and a large portion of the population in Liverpool feel that there are still unanswered questions over the events and blame still to be apportioned.In addition there are questions regarding, what is seen as, the post event coverup and the part played in it by Norman Bettison. Who was latter appointed Chief Constable of Merseyside by Merseyside Police Authority in circumstances that caused members of the authority to resign.The Sun newspaper and it's then editor Kelvin Mackensey are still regarded with hate by a portion of Liverpool fans for there coverage of the events particularly for blaming Liverpool fans and for allegations that fans attacked the police during the rescue and urinated on them.About 50 cyclists have been involved in a hit-and-run attack by a car in the suburb of Mascot, just south of the centre of Sydney, Australia.The cyclists, including former Australian Olympian Ben Kersten, and road racer Kate Nichols, were in a group of cyclists hit when a driver who had been "worrying" the rear of the pack, overtook the cyclists, pulled in front of the pack, and then slammed on the brakes.The riders suffered a collection of minor scrapes and bruises, but no deaths were caused. The incident, which has been reported to have caused approximately A$30,000 worth of property damage to the cyclist's vehicles, also caused a semi-trailer to jack-knife, and cars to swerve.  Although the cyclists had been following Australian road rules, the National Roads and Motorists' Association's senior adviser, Anne Morphett, said a large bike pack can sometimes stretch to 40 metres. "They need to break them up so cars can overtake safely. You might have three across and five deep, but not 40 or 50 deep," she said. "We want to see people get their training in but they need to be in areas that are safe - and these are public roads, not a training facility."Kate Nichols, one of the injured, was also seriously injured in a crash in Germany in 2005 involving the Australian women's road cycling team that killed Australian cyclist Amy Gillett.The driver, a 34 year old man from Claymore, has been spoken to, but has yet to be charged.The Kentucky Kernel, the University of Kentucky student newspaper, rejected a full-page ad calling for Tubby Smith's dismissal as the men's basketball head coach.  Richard Cheeks, a professor at the school, and a group called Concerned Fans for UK Basketball sought the $1,700 ad.Cheeks said "We see the program in decline. ... We don't want it to decline the way the Louisville program did in the latter years when Denny Crum was there. So we decided that we were going to begin to get our message out."A spokesman for Kentucky basketball, Scott Stricklin, said "Being that he's one of the nation's winningest coaches, he pretty much knows what it takes to win championships because he's done it here," Stricklin said.The Kentucky Kernel's general manager, Chris Poore, the decision to reject the ad was without the influence from the University of Kentucky's administration.In the past nine seasons at Kentucky, Smith has obtained a 241-71 record, including winning the 1998 national championship.Today, Filippo Pozzato (Team Liquigas) won the 62nd running of the Belgian distance bike race Omloop Het Volk with a sneak attack past the leaders, Stuart O'Grady (Team CSC) and Juan Antonio Flecha (Team Rabobank).

Tom Boonen (Team Quickstep) from the chase group came third.Argentina and the Netherlands drew 0-0 in a cagey stalemate in Frankfurt, Wednesday.Both sides had rested key players for the game and seemed to give the greatest respect for the other side's abilities and in the end both defenses won.File:Commerzbank-Arena-Luftbild.jpgWith Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez, who started for rested players, Argentina had the talent to get a win.  However; though Messi was lively the Argentines struggled for space to trouble the Orangemen and Argentina had to settle for a draw, which was enough to top Group C. The Netherlands, who had rested Arjen Robben and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, had the best of the first twenty minutes play. In this time they had 65 per cent of the play, although this was to almost even out by the end of the match. A goal nearly came when Dirk Kuyt robbed a defender to the left of the penalty box and ran toward goal. Had Kuyt passed to Ruud Van Nistelrooij instead of forcing a near post save out of Roberto Abbondanzieri there may subsequently have been a more open match. Argentina then had more of play though they needed a set piece to trouble the opponent's defence. A Juan Riquelme freekick fizzed low into the box and Khalid Boolahrouz almost tipped into his own net but Edwin Van Der Sar's right post intervened.The teams denied each other space which made it hard to pass around the penalty boxes and get clear sights of goal. This is implied in the game statistics. Both keepers made three saves during the game; while - indicating some attacking play - there were 17 corner kicks as defenders successfully blocked crosses and shots.The best two moments in a second half that was more scratchy than the first came from the boot of Tevez. On 72 minutes a hard shot from outside the box produced a one-handed save from Van Der Sar and a last minute effort from a long ball whizzed wide.In the round of sixteen Argentina would play the runners-up of Group D who were Mexico. The Netherlands would play Portugal for the right to get into the Fifa World Cup quarter-finals.On Friday, Argentina defeated Colombia in the third quarter- final of the 2015 Copa América ((en))Spanish language: ‍America Cup which was held in Estadio Sausalito stadium in Viña del Mar, Chile.

Rodriguez jumped to receive the ball and, in the same moment, chested high the way it had come. He met the descending ball 25 yards out with a perfectly timed left-footed volley and the ball arrowed over Oswaldo Sanchez into the opposite corner of the net.The evenness and excitement of the match might easily be overshadowed by the winning goal. Though the shot totals were not high - Argentina had five shots on target to Mexico's three -  the action was end to end.Part of the reason for the excitement was while Mexico tried to keep a fast attacking pace Argentina attempted to slow the game down. There could have been more goals; both Argentina and Mexico defended well and had timely saves from their goalkeepers. Mexico got off to the best possible start with a goal from a set-piece after five minutes. Pavel Pardo's cross from the right touchline was flicked on by Mario Mendez and Rafael Marquez slid in to score on a half volley at the far post.For Argentina the equalising goal five minutes later was the best possible response to going behind. A corner kick was swung in low to the near post; Hernan Crespo raised his foot, Jared Borgetti stuck out his neck and between them the ball sped past Sanchez.The match had its moment of controversy. Just before half time the Argentine goalkeeper rolled a ball to Gabriel Heinze. Somehow his defender let it go past him to Mexican striker Jose Fonseca. Heinze lunged to bring Fonseca down. Massimo Busacca adjudged Roberto Ayala to be the last defender and spared Heinze the red card for the deliberate professional foul. Goalkeepers at either end made match saving contributions in the second half.  On 53 minutes Roberto Abbondanzieri saved a defensive a clearance that deflected off Borgetti six yards from goal. Five minutes later Javier Saviola was through on goal; he went high and hard with the shot but Sanchez stuck out a strong left palm and batted the ball away for a corner. Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez replaced Crespo and Saviola as Argentina sought to break the deadlock. A minute from time Tevez thought he was through on goal but Ricardo Osorio got back just in time and the game was destined for another 30 minutes and that special moment in extra time.Argentina's win meant they would play their quarter-final match in the Olympiastadion, Berlin, against the host nation Germany on June 30.Argentina thrashed Serbia and Montenegro 6-0 in a display that stunned the crowd in Gelsenkirchen, Friday.On one side of this one-way game there was an embarrassment of Argentine talent; on the other there was the humiliation of Ilija Petkovic's side being out-played for 90 minutes by a team at the top of their form.With the roof over the Veltins Arena it was dark enough in the stadium for camera flashes to light up in the crowd. On the pitch the Argentine players provided the flashes of brilliance.An early goal after six minutes was the first of six goals that were the product of almost flawless team play and individual execution. Argentina swept down the left, Maxi Rodriguez ran at speed into a pass and toe-poked first time beyond Dragoslav Jevric.The next one was the climax of a 24 pass move. Esteban Cambiasso tapped the ball forward to Hernan Crespo just inside the penalty area; a back heal and Cambiasso ran on and smacked it past Jevric.On 35 minutes the Argentina fans in the crowd seemed to know which way the game was going. The chant "Ole" was heard as the Argentines continued to pass amongst themselves with great ease.Totally dominant, the blue and white stripes had over 60 per cent ball possession come half-time. Roberto Abbondanzieri in the Argentina goal was for the most part the spectator number 52'001.It could have been four nil at the break but on 36 minutes Crespo's effort was judged to have come from an offside position.  Crespo got booked because he did not stop when the referee blew his whistle. The television replay showed the linesman was mistaken.The third goal came on 41 minutes. Jevric could only palm a Javier Saviola shot to Maxi Rodriguez at the far post who stuck away his second off the post.Savo Milosevic won his hundredth cap for Serbia and Montenegro, a statistic that included games with the Yugoslavia football team. He forced a corner with a hard long range shot and failed to reach a header after Danijel Ljuboja had briefly stretched Argentina on the right.On 64 minutes Mateja Kezman appeared to make a frustrated two-footed lunge which caught Javier Mascherano. The referee reached for the red card and made a hard position harder for the unfortunate Serbia and Montenegro team.Then it was the Lionel Messi show. The Argentines were comfortable but had not scored in the second half until the 19-year-old Barcelona striker came on after 74 minutes.  Soon there were three more goals to the total.Messi set up Crespo for a tap in; he burst into the penalty area and a delivered a superb low pass across the goal that beat both the keeper and defenders.Another young Argentine Carlos Tevez got past two half-hearted challenges from the Serbia and Montenegro defence and put the fifth around Jevric. The goal many Argentines in the crowd had waited for came two minutes from time. Messi, recently back from injury, was fed on another burst into the penalty area. He beat Jevric at his near post.This year Montenegro made their split from Serbia official in the political arena. In the Veltins Arena, Friday, the performance of the two national sides combined might be grounds for the coming football divorce.The mathematics of the Group C table mean Jose Pekerman's Argentina are not yet through to the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup. They would go through if the Netherlands did not lose to Ivory Coast, who played Friday.On Saturday, in the 2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup final in Colombia, Argentina defeated Russia 5–4 to win their first World Cup trophy.Russian player Eder Lima netted the first goal of the match in the 16th minute. Alamiro Vaporaki scored an equaliser within 30 seconds. Argentina got the lead just before half time as Leandro Cuzzolino successfully converted a second spot penalty kick into a goal, due to the sixth foul committed by the Russian side.Less than two minutes into the second half, Lima scored an equaliser for Russia. But Argentina's Alan Brandi scored two goals in quick succession, as La Albiceleste lead 4–2. In the dying moments of the game, Constantino Vaporaki scored the fifth goal for Argentina, putting both the Vaporaki brothers' names on the score sheet. Within 40 seconds Dmitry Lyskov scored a goal for Russia, and in the final minute Lima scored a penalty completing his hat trick, but Argentina was still ahead and won 5–4 at the end of the final time at the Coliseo El Pueblo stadium in the city of Cali.Argentine captain Fernando Wilhelm won the Golden Ball for the best player of the tournament. Iran defeated Portugal 4–3 on penalties after a 2–2 draw to win the bronze medal.On Tuesday, Italian-capital football club AS Roma announced the signing of Argentine midfielder Javier Pastore from French club Paris Saint-Germain on a five-year contract, which runs through to June 30, 2023.

"The body doesn't just keep going and going."Speculation on the retirement of the six-time Tour de France winner had been growing in recent months.

The contract with his new team sponsor, the Discovery Channel, obligates him to compete in one more Tour de France.Arsenal beat Real Madrid 1-0 in a UEFA Champions League second round, first leg match on February 21, 2006. A 47th minute goal from Thierry Henry meant that Arsenal became the first side from England ever to win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.Arsenal generally had the better of the game, Henry's goal coming after he made a surging run from midfield, evading challenges from both Ronaldo and Thomas Gravesen before shooting low past Iker Casillas. Arsenal's Spanish forward Jose Antonio Reyes had had an early chance, which was saved by Casillas while Roberto Carlos blocked a Fredrik Ljungberg shot. At the other end, Real's David Beckham had two chances, one a missed header and the other a clear one-on-one, but Jens Lehmann saved. Late on in the game, Arsenal sub Abou Diaby could have scored a second, but Casillas saved at his feet, before Ronaldo just missed a Beckham cross in front of an open goal.The second leg of the tie will be played at Highbury on March 8, 2006.Real Madrid: Casillas, Cicinho, Sergio, Woodgate (Mejia 9), Carlos, Gravesen (Julio Baptista 76), Beckham, Guti, Zidane, Robinho (Raul 63), Ronaldo.Arsenal: Lehmann, Eboue, Toure, Senderos, Flamini, Ljungberg, Hleb (Pires 76), Gilberto Silva, Fabregas (Song 90), Reyes (Diaby 80), Henry.On Sunday, London-based football club Arsenal, winners of the 2015 FA Cup, defeated 2015 Premier League Champions Chelsea 1–0 in the 2015 Community Shield trophy which was played in the Wembley Stadium.The match saw only two yellow cards, to one player from each club in the second half. Though Arsenal had lesser possession of the ball and fewer shots, they had more shots on target. A total of 23 fouls were committed. It took fourteen attempts for The Gunners to win a game over the city rivals. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the only goal of the match, for Arsenal in the 24th minute. Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois could not save this left-footed shot in the top corner which gave Arsenal a lead. In the 80th minute, Chelsea won a free kick. Eden Hazard's kick was denied by ex-Chelsea Petr Čech, who recently signed for Arsenal and this was his debut for Arsenal.This was Arsène Wenger's first victory over the Portuguese Chelsea manager José Mourinho. Wenger did not even shake hands with Mourinho after the victory. This is back-to-back Community Shields for Arsenal. They defeated Manchester City in the previous final."We were the best team", said Mourinho in remarks to BT Sport.  "We had more initiative, we controlled the game by having ball possession. Arsenal defended with 10 players, they put everybody in front of their own line and they had good organisation, congratulations to them."Serie A champions Juventus have confirmed the $24,000,000 (£13,700,000, €20,000,000) capture of Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira.The central midfielder, who will now partner Brazilian - Emerson, has signed a 5 year contract at the Stadio Delle Alpi.Juve had been in talks for the 29-year-old for the last few weeks and a deal has been completed.Vieira will now link up with boss Fabio Capello again after a brief stint at AC Milan with him almost a decade ago.The Frenchman joins the side despite being strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid over the last two summers.Vieira ends his Premiership stay after nine years in England since he became Arsene Wenger's first signing at Arsenal.Arsenal and PSV met at the Emirates Stadium in London earlier today for the second leg of their Champions League battle.  The first match ended 1-0 for PSV, giving them the advantage from the start in this game, as a tie would be all they needed to win.  Arsenal, who again were without Thiery Henry to start the football match, played a very young side as usual, although 17 year old Theo Walcott was with Henry on the subs bench.  PSV  played an attacking side, with Arouna Kone and Jefferson Farfan in the front.PSV started strong out of the gate, and appeared to catch the home team by surprise with their determination.  Arsenal were able to stave off the first attacks, and soon had the game under controlled and switched it into one way traffic.  Fabregas and Denilson played strongly in the midfield to dictate the play for Arsenal, and soon chances began to show for the Gunners.  The first fell to the Ivorian Kolo Toure, who pushed off his fellow countryman Kone, only to see his shot fly harmlessly wide of the net.  More chances poured in for Arsenal, but the youngsters did not have the killer touch to finish off any clean shots on the goal.  William Gallas of Arsenal had to leave the pitch to replace a contact lens, and PSV took a chance on the man advantage to press forward.  Phillip Cocu put himself in a great position behind the defense, but spurned his chance as he headed the ball wide.  Arsenal again pressed, as a header by Adebayor went wide, along with two volleys by Julio Baptista.At the start of the second half, Arsenal continued to be frustrated by a combination of poor finishing and good defending by PSV.  The Gunners would finally get the goal they needed after 58 minutes, thanks to an own goal by Alex.  A corner by Arsenal allowed Adebayor to flick the ball on, and fortuitously it bounced off the hapless defender Alex and into the net.  The goal boosted Arsenals confidence, and they continued to press the game.  Arsenal nearly doubled their lead when Adebayor was sent one on one with keeper Heurelho, but his shot was directly at the keeper, and the game remained at 1-0 for the home side.  As they pushed forward, Arsenal left gaps at the back, and Jefferson Farfan exposed one such gap before Denilson brought him down in the area, but no penalty was given.  Henry then joined the fray from the bench, and though he didn't look completely comfortble, still managed to force Heurelho into a save with a dipping free kick.  PSV would make Arsenal pay for their missed chances however, as Alex made up for his own goal and headed and Edison Mendez free kick home, tying the game and giving PSV the lead on aggregate.  The aggregate loss concluded a sorrowful series of cup events for Arsenal after they lost in both the FA Cup and the Carling Cup, and now added the Champions League to the list.On Sunday, London-based club Arsenal F.C. agreed to sign 21-year-old Japanese forward Takuma Asano from Sanfrecce Hiroshima and their city rivals Chelsea F.C. has signed 22-year-old Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi from French club Olympique de Marseille.Today, London-based football club Arsenal announced signing 23-year-old Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka from German club Borussia Mönchengladbach.

In planning for almost two years a US$5 million backing from  Malaysian business tycoons Tony Fernandes of AirAsia and Indonesian media mogul Erick Thoir should see the league commence in September this year. The goal is to boost the mainstream popularity of basketball which, according to organizers of the new league, is already the second most popular team sport behind football.Fernandes believes using overseas professional players will help increase the competitiveness and skills of the local ASEAN players. Fernandes said, "The aim is to develop local talent. Foreign players from outside ASEAN will be role models. Maybe one day our players will play in the NBA."Singapore's The Straits Times quoted secretary general of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), Patrick Baumann, as saying "Asia was ready for a professional league but warned organizers will have to ensure it doesn't fade away after a few years. The time is right but it is not going to be simple to sustain the league". He further added that "there has to be good entertainment. The clubs need to be managed professionally and well funded. You cannot have the league for one or two years and then stop."Addressing concerns over the current financial crisis and its possible impact on the launch of the league Fernandes said, "Yes, there will be a lot of obstacles and road blocks. But no mountain will stop us. During an economic downturn like now, this new league will create jobs."The composition of the league is still under discussion however it is expected that at least eight teams will part of the series this year. Each nation will be permitted a maximum of two privately owned teams. Other details including prize money, sponsorship and number of games is still in planning. The league will be organised by the South-east Asian Basketball Association which governs basketball across the region.Singapore Slingers are expected to be one of the first confirmed teams in the new competition. Bob Turner, CEO of the Slingers, said "We are definitely very interested. We believe that this will take the sport to the next level and we hope to confirm our entry as soon as possible."The league is tentatively scheduled to start in September 2009 and continue until February 2010. It will initially consist of eight teams that will play on a home-and-away basis.

It comprises a round-robin group stage followed by a knock-out finals series.The Mariners defeated Villa 2–0 in their Group D fixture earlier in the tournament, courtesy of a double to striker Matt Simon.

According to the press conference facilitator, the media set a record for most people attending an Olympic team announcement at the AIS.BigPond Media, the Liberal Party's own media people, the Daily Telegraph, and 2UE  were some of the media organisations present, with some having made the trip up to Canberra from Sydney. The level of media present stands in stark contrast to the Australia women's national basketball team training camp at the AIS in May where Fox Sports, WIN News, and the Canberra Times were the few media outlets in attendance.While a team practice open to the press started at 10:30 a.m. Canberra Time (0030 UTC), many in the media corps arrived after athletes finished practice but before Abbott was scheduled to speak.  Those who arrived early had to be asked by coaches to step off the mats as the gymnasts were still practicing, which sport journalists and photographers in Australia do not generally have to be told. Following the press conference, when Abbott and Australia's Minister for Sport Kate Lundy jumped off the trampoline into a foam pit, they got an upfront view of photojournalists who climbed into the pit beforehand in order to get a better picture.  The Australian media's lack of interest in the gymnastics announcement made its way into the printed coverage, with The Daily Telegraph's Alison McMeekin poking fun at Abbott as "Trampoline Tony", and not a single gymnast's name in her coverage. Sister News Limited tabloid, and Australia's highest circulation newspaper, the Herald Sun also carried McMeekin's jabs at the opposition leader. Ben Packham of The Australian, another News Limited publication, spun the announcement of the gymnastics team to criticise with the headline Abbott accused of carbon tax gymnastics.Australia's Liberal Party sent their own media representative to cover Abbott's appearance.  The cameraman had one job, to cover Abbott.  His boss told him he did not need to get any footage of the gymnasts if Abbott was not in frame.Shortly after Abbott and Lundy left, most of the press corps disappeared from the AIS facility.Prior to 2007 Taipei 101 Run Up, organizers held a 35-floors warming up match for local athletes from 2009 Summer Deaflympics with the theme of "Value Your Every Step". This warming up simulated every possible situation as athletes wore the RFID chip and some professional medical teams stood by for emergency."Taipei City and 2009 Summer Deaflympics (in the future) will be known with a conjunction from this game (Taipei 101 Run Up) and the promotion of 2009 Summer Deaflympics." Emile Sheng (Chief Executive Director of 2009 Summer Deaflympics) remarked before this match, "We (Taipei City Government, the organizer of 2009 Deaflympics) will provide the best service for athletes from participated nations to do an effective promotion of the deaf culture in Taiwan.""The deaf culture in Taiwan was rarely respected by common people. After Taipei City was elected to be the organizer of the 2009 Deaflympics, and a success of '2007 World Deaf Swimming Championship', this (deaf) culture is now progressively respected around the world. I hope this game can be a great platform to make this known by more and more people with deaf athletes' participation." Sue Wang (Spokeswoman of 2007 Taipei Run Up and Sign Language Anchor of Public Television Service) remarked.Hsiao-hua Tseng and Lan-feng Chen, men's and women's fastest athlete in this (warming up) match, finished separately with 6 min 9 secs and 6 min 45 secs. After this match, the host (Taipei 101) awarded certifications and announced that the main match will take place next Sunday (November 25) morning.London, England — As Paralympians ready for the Games which are set to open later this week, they have access to a world class fitness center inside the Paralympic Village which is designed to maximise their pre-Game preparations.According to volunteers staffing the center, instead of being a single large room, as in Beijing, the building has numerous rooms. It, along with the adjacent Village Services Centre, is designed to be converted into a school after the games conclude. Rooms have been structured as a gym, an auditorium, and science laboratories.Gym equipment is supplied by Technogym, an Italian firm that has supplied gym equipment for the Olympics since 2000. Equipment has been provided not just for for the Fitness Centre, but for gyms at all the Olympic venues. The newest equipment is oriented toward maximum flexibility, allowing athletes to exercise the particular muscles that they most require for their sport.

There are also a number of instructors available to provide motivational training.London, England — Yesterday, on the final day of competition, athletics concluded at the London Paralympics with the running and wheeling of the marathon for the men's T12, T46 and T54, and the women's T54. Spain and Great Britain both had a gold and a silver medal, Brazil and the United States had a gold each, Switzerland had a silver and a bronze medal, Colombia had a silver medal, and Tunisia, Australia and Belarus each had a bronze medal.Alberto Suarez Laso of Spain set a world and European record in the T12 marathon with a time of 2:24:50.  In the same event, Tunisian Abderrahim Zhiou set an African record with a time of 2:26:56 and Colomobian Elkin Alonso Serna Moreno set an Americas record with a time of 2:26:39.  Despite failing to get a medal, Japanese Masahiro Okamura set an Asian record with a time of 2:28:51.  In the women's T54 event, Australian Christie Dawes set an Oceania record with a time of 1:49:37.Great Britain's gold medal was earned by David Weir, and was Weir's fourth gold medal earned in the London.  This put Weir at the top of the individual gold medal count for London alongside Raymond Martin of the United States. Tatyana McFadden of the United States had a chance at four gold medals in London, but was unable to seriously compete after a pair of tire punctures mid-race that seriously slowed her down.  McFadden conveyed her experiences in the race to the media, saying, "At 18 or 19 miles it went again, this always seems to happen to me in London. Luckily, I had a spare but I was bombed out. I just wanted to sit and cry but I also wanted to finish, there was only about six miles to go and I was determined I wasn't going to get another flat tyre]. [...] Finishing is the most important thing for me, it makes you a better person. I just wanted to compete and stay strong."Swiss racer Edith Wolf quit the women's marathon mid-race after running into a hole on the course that left her without feeling in her left arm and neck, and required her to be hospitalized.  Following the race, Wolf's husband and coach told the media, "She was really looking forward to the marathon. She was really prepared, so I think she's really disappointed. I think tomorrow she will wake up and see her four medals and she will be very happy."  When questioned about the media, some of whom disappeared at the conclusion of the men's race, and specifically the media from Wolf's home country, he said, "There are not so many media here, which is disappointing. But now they have recognised this  is really a great Games. This is the second biggest sports event in the world and they are not here, so it's their loss, they missed a big chance."Colombia's German Naranjo Jaramillo served as Elkin Alonso Serena Morena's guide for the length of the marathon.  Because of this, Jaramillo also earned a silver medal.  Gold medalist Laso of Spain and bronze medalist Zhiou of Tunisia utilized multiple guides, and the guides were not eligible for medals. Other runners in the men's T12 marathon who had the same guide the whole race included ninth place Ildar Pomykalov of Russia who was guided by Aleksei Lashmanov, and Henry Wanyoike of Kenya who did not finish but was guided by Joseph Gachuhi.Fifteen years after the Winnipeg Jets left the province of Manitoba, Canada, an announcement on Tuesday made official what ice hockey fans have been anticipating: The National Hockey League's (NHL) Atlanta Thrashers are moving to Winnipeg. The Thrashers, who have been a target for relocation rumors amid the ownership struggles and financial losses, will leave Atlanta after eleven seasons there in the highest-level professional ice hockey league in North America. The deal, which was finalized early in the morning Tuesday, has just one step to climb: a vote by the NHL's Board of Governors, which will take up the matter at their June 21 meeting.Atlanta Spirit Group, LLC. (ASG), who owned the Thrashers—and continues to own both the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association, as well as Philips Arena, the arena both teams occupied—completed the sale to Winnipeg investor group True North Sports & Entertainment Ltd. The Thrashers will move into their new home arena, MTS Centre in Winnipeg. ASG has also been trying to find buyers for the Atlanta Hawks as well as Philips Arena. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, who also presided over the league when the Jets left Winnipeg in 1996, has stated the Thrashers will remain in the Southeast Division for at least the 2011-12 season, after which time the NHL is expected to shuffle teams between the Western and Eastern conferences to move the Thrashers to the West, to play with other teams in western North America. The two teams situated in the Western Conference which reside in the Eastern Time Zone, the Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets, as well as the Nashville Predators are considered favorites to be moved into the Eastern Conference when this happens.The city of Winnipeg, which has been ready and waiting for an NHL franchise since the Jets relocated to Glendale, Arizona and became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996, is already host to a team in the second-tier American Hockey League, the Manitoba Moose. During the announcement Tuesday, True North stated that they were starting a season ticket drive. They also announced that they have yet to choose a name for the new team.The Thrashers are not the first franchise that True North has set its sights on in regards to acquiring an NHL team. The Coyotes, which have been owned by the league since the previous owners filed for bankruptcy in 2009, was highly sought-after by True North in the past few years in an attempt to literally "return the Jets to Winnipeg". In early May, the Glendale City Council approved a measure to pay $25 million to the league, to cover their operating expenses for the next year in order to keep the team in the city.This is not the first time an NHL franchise has been relocated north of the border from the #8-ranked media market in the United States; in 1980, the Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary, Alberta, becoming the Calgary Flames. Atlanta was later granted an expansion franchise in 1997, and the Thrashers took the ice to start the 1999-00 NHL season. In the 11 seasons the Thrashers spent in Atlanta, they made the playoffs only once; in the 2006-07 season, they reached the Eastern Conference quarterfinals, where they were swept in the best-of-seven series by the New York Rangers in four straight games.Yesterday at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, Real Madrid lost 1–0 to crosstown rival Atlético de Madrid in this year's edition of the Madrid derby.  Atlético de Madrid had last defeated Real Madrid in La Liga play in 1999.Diego Costa scored the game's only goal, following an early ten minutes where Real Madrid dominated on possession.  Following the goal, Real Madrid was unable to keep up possession and Atlético successfully shut down much of Real Madrid's passing game.  Atlético players also slowed down the play with a number of players falling to the ground. Real Madrid's fans shouted that miracles were happening because after Atlético players rolled around on the ground, they would get up and be able to walk and run within seconds.The Auckland City Council in New Zealand has approved the proposed NZ$700 million+ waterfront stadium in 13-7 (yes-no) vote in a marathon session lasting nearly 5 hours on Thursday night instead of an upgrade of Eden Park costing around $400 million. However they have called for the stadium to be location "substantially east" of the central government's preferred Marsden Wharf/Captain Cook site. The proposed stadium has been dubbed "Stadium New Zealand" by the media.Two weeks ago Trevor Mallard, sports minister, said that the two councils had two weeks to come up with a decision on whether or not to support a waterfront stadium or Eden Park.It is now falls on the Auckland Regional Council to approve the stadium plans or propose something else, which is supposed to happen tomorrow, Friday. Based on both these decisions, the central government will then make a decision on whether to construct the new Stadium New Zealand or upgrade the current Eden Park, located also in Auckland, which site will also be chosen. It is intended that this stadium will be used for the 2011 Rugby World Cup final.Dick Hubbard, Mayor of Auckland, said: "In the past Auckland had missed too many opportunities. We can't get it wrong, we cannot bypass this opportunity. Controversy is a good sign, a healthy sign – all the major projects around the world have had controversy. Today it's not about rugby, it is about boldness and vision against caution."As long as the waterfront stadium is moved then they have a "strong and absolute preference" towards the stadium. Neil Abel, councillor, had tried to remove the "strong and absolute" remark because he believes that Aucklanders did not get an opportunity to indicate that the decision is absolute.Christine Caughey, councillor, said that the pressure that was put upon them for their decision by Mr Mallard was like "putting a gun to your head."Other councillors also said that there wasn't enough time given for Aucklanders to have their say and to make their decision. They also said that some of their questions about the costs and transport, etc were left unanswered.Despite those setbacks the majority did agree that the design of the stadium should be "bold, iconic and reflect our first city of the Pacific aspirations".If the government cant make a deal with the Ports of Auckland, which owns the land the waterfront stadium is to be located, the regional council, other stakeholders, to move the stadium then the ACC will withdraw their support and support their second favoured, an upgrade of Eden Park.The Auckland Regional Council (ARC) has voted to support an upgrade of Eden Park and not the New Zealand government's preferred option of a new stadium built on Auckland's waterfront. The stadium consultation is because to host the Rugby World Cup, which New Zealand is hosting in 2011, the final venue has to be able to seat at least 60,000 people.Trevor Mallard, minister for sports, would not comment on the decision made by the ARC. Mr Mallard would not speak to the media until Monday when he goes to the cabinet.Yesterday the Auckland City Council also made their decision on the stadium but they had a different opinion, going with the waterfront stadium.Mr Mallard said a fortnight ago that the final will go to Christchurch's stadium Jade Stadium if the two councils could not agree on the stadium they wish to pursue.With coming to its decision the ARC said that it sympathizes with the public as there was no formal public consultation and the two weeks given to them to make their decision and tell the government their choice was not enough time.The ARC also said that the Auckland City Councils resolution to move the waterfront stadium around 200 metres to the east is not viable as found by a Technical Working Group working for Trevor Mallard."By taking this decision, they may be putting more responsibility on Auckland ratepayers," the mayor of Auckland, Dick Hubbard, said.The ARC found the waterfront stadium was "inappropriate" because there would be a significant adverse reaction to the council owned Ports of Auckland, special legislation would be required to build it, it would have a "negative impact on the heritage and urban design values of the Britomart precinct and the adjacent waterfront area", and it would be quite expensive to build.With all the above considered the ARC decided to pursue the Eden Park option as it is also an internationally recognised stadium and was used for the bid to attempt New Zealand to get the 2011 Ruby World Cup."Trevor Mallard's stadium is a dead duck," he said. "This afternoon he has no option but to take the waterfront stadium off the table," Keith Locke, Member of Parliament for the Green party.On Friday, the Aussie Spirit finished their test series against the Japan women's national softball team with a 6-5 victory, winning two out of seven games against the second ranked team in the world.  The series had important implications for both teams as their coaches need to trim their rosters down from twenty to seventeen ahead of the World Championships later this year in Canada.The last game of the series came down to Australia's final batter.  The game was tied 5-5 going into the bottom of the seventh inning. Clare Warwick led off the inning with a double. Chelsea Forkin then grounded out but advanced Warwick to third. Brenda De Blaes then made a base hit.  The Japanese attempted a throw home to prevent Warwick from scoring.  In the run down to try to tag her out, the catcher made an error and overthrew the ball to the third baseman that allowed Warwick to score and end the game.In the first two games of the series on Wednesday, Australia lost 3-2 and 5-3. On Thursday night, with several home runs having been scored on both sides, Australia lost both games to Japan by scores of 10-7 and 7-4. Friday night, Australia won the first game 5-3 and lost the second one 7-1.In field hockey at The Hague, Netherlands, Australia defeated the Netherlands to win the 2014 Men's Hockey World Cup yesterday, and was defeated by the Netherlands in the 2014 Women's Hockey World Cup on Saturday. Never before have the same two countries played in both Hockey World Cup finals in a single year.In the men's final, the Australian team, known as the Kookaburras and coached by Ric Charlesworth, successfully defended the World Cup they won back in 2010 with a 6–1 win over the Netherlands team, which was playing in its first final since 1998. The Netherlands put the Kookaburras on the back foot when Jeroen Hertzberger scored the first goal. In five consecutive games in the series the Australians had scored their first goal in the first seven minutes. Australia's Chris Ciriello equalised with a goal from a penalty corner. Another goal by Kieran Govers gave the Kookaburras a 2–1 lead at the half time break. Four more goals in the second half, including one by 321-game veteran Jamie Dwyer, put the result beyond doubt.The story was very different in the women's competition, where the Australian women's team, known as the Hockeyroos, were the underdogs, having not made a final in the World Cup or the Olympic Games since 2006. They made this final only after defeating the team in a semi-final penalty shoot out after a 2–2 draw in which the teams alternated goals, each Australian goal followed by a US goal by Kelsey Kolojejchick. Whereas, the Netherlands team had scored 21 goals in the tournament up to this point, while only conceding one, and had not been beaten by Australia since 1998. Netherlands captain Maartje Paumen scored the first goal of the match from a penalty stroke, giving the Netherlands team their seventh Hockey World Cup win. Kim Lammers then made it 2–0.  Neither side was able to score in the second half, but it was not for want of trying, and Australian goal keeper Rachael Lynch ended up with a total of eight saves.Argentina defeated the United States 2–1 in the women's bronze medal game.London, England — At London's Olympic Basketball Arena last night, Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team decisively beat South Africa by a score of 93 to 39 before a crowd of 2,106.

Football Federation Australia's statement said they "respect[ed]" the federal government's decision.Hong Kong and the Northern Mariana Islands are the other two counties in the same group with North Korea and Australia. In March, a qualification match between Malaysia and North Korea for 2019's Asian Cup was rescheduled after Kim Jong-Nam's death at Kuala Lumpur airport, half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. On September 28 the match was postponed — by this time, its third postponement — after the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs barred Malaysians from travelling to North Korea.Last month, at the UN general assembly, US president Donald Trump said the US "would [...] totally destroy North Korea" if the US had to defend the US and its allies from North Korea.

Edward Ockenden of Australia had earlier scored in the sixth minute and Moritz Furste of Germany drew level in the 46th minute.Germany, the two-time defending champions, had beaten Australia in the final of both the previous Hockey World Cups by one goal.

Openers Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden got off to a flying start, achieving 0/19 off the first two overs.  Hayden was later caught and bowled by Paul Wiseman for 70.  Although Hayden was clearly out, he refused to walk, insisting after the incident with Craig McMillan in the previous test, that the field umpires called for the video replay, which quickly ruled that he was out.  Ponting then came out to replace Hayden, and quickly took a fancy to the New Zealand bowlers.  He eventually misjudged a spin delivery from Daniel Vettori and was stumped for 68.  Damien Martyn briefly stepped in, but was cheaply dismissed for 7, only to be replaced by Darren Lehmann, who is not out on 28.The best performance of the innings though, came from Justin Langer, who is currently not out on 144.  Australia, at the time of writing, are 3/327, putting themselves into a commanding position for the second day's play.  Australia has already won the series with their previous victory in Brisbane, and this test is widely regarded merely as batting practice for Stephen Fleming's New Zealand side.  Key bowler James Franklin is returning from injury in this game, but has had a poor start, with figures of 0/84 off of 14 overs.Following its recent loss to South Africa, the Australian Cricket team has replaced player Jason Krejza for Nathan Hauritz in the traditional Boxing Day test to be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of an expected crowd of 70,000.

Only West Indies have done better making 7-418 in Antigua during the 2002-03 tour.All rounder Andrew Symonds kept his place despite being restricted in training with knee-soreness. Victorian speed bowler Peter Siddle was also thought to be on the verge of replacement yet managed to retain his place in the team. There has been rumour that the injury would keep Symonds out and Queenslands team mate Shane Watson would be returned after time on the sidelines.News.com.au quotes Australian Captain Ricky Ponting "We have only made the one change in the side and that's Nathan Hauritz will come in for Jason Krejza. Otherwise we are pretty happy with what most of the rest of the guys did in Perth."Australia, currently leading the work test team rankings must avoid a 3-0 loss to South Africa if they are to retain their current rankings. If they do loose the series, it will be the first time they have done so on home soil since they lost the West Indies in 1993.Following their emphatic win, South Africa has named an unchanged side putting aside doubt over vice-captain Ashwell Prince making a comeback as he continues to suffer with a thumb injury. South Africa will train before joining family and friends in the traditional Christmas Day luncheon for both teams.Homebush Bay, New South Wales —Last night, the Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team beat Japan 80–49 in their final game of pool play at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge taking place at at the Sport Centre at the Sydney Olympic Park and are through to the first place match.The contrast between the two teams was seen in their wheels: almost every Australian player had a four wheeled chair that gave them increased stability while every single Japanese player had three wheels, which gave them great maneuverability.   Japan played the aggressor throughout the match, with several players aggressively blocking with wheelchair on wheelchair contact.  Both sides were loud, chanting defense, defense, defense when their side was on that side of the court.The first quarter was closely fought, with Japan racking up 5 by 5:54 left in the first.  They successfully took a lead of 17–16 by the end of the first quarter.  They were unable to hold the lead, with Australia holding a 40–24 lead at the end of the first half.

Coach Verbeek gave Viduka a week to decide whether he wants to be part of Australia's plans in the future."He has this week to make up his mind," Verbeek said. "I have one spot open and that's the spot for him. It's up to him. We all know his situation at Newcastle, a very tough year, a long time injured, missed a lot of games, played the final five or six games in a row, relegated, end of contract and not the youngest player anymore, so I think he has enough things on his mind. If he makes the decision not to play anymore, then we have to respect his decision." Nick Carle, Brad Jones, Adrian Madaschi, Mark Milligan, Matthew Spiranovic and Shane Steffanuto, who have been out of the side for varying lengths of time, all return for the qualifiers.Australia currently head Group A in round four of Asian Football Confederation qualifying.

Australia scored six tries, two to inside centre Matt Giteau, as they recorded their largest win over South Africa. It was the first time a team had been held scoreless in the Tri Nations since South Africa's 28-0 loss to the All Blacks in Dunedin in 1999, and the margin was one point shy of the Springboks' worst defeat in their history, a 53-3 rout by England at Twickenham in 2002.The Wallabies made four changes to their starting lineup that lost to the All Blacks the week before. Hooker Jeremy Paul, No. 8 Scott Fava and inside center Giteau were all moved into the starting lineup, with Rocky Elsom moving to blindside flanker. Queensland prop Rodney Blake was expected to return for the Wallabies, but failed to recover from injury in time.

Matthew Hoggard was the shining light for the visitors, taking 7-109.England resumed the fifth day at 1-59, and the match looked headed for a draw. However, with some magic from Shane Warne, Australia managed to roll England for just 129 in the last over before tea, setting up a thrilling final session run chase. Warne took 4-49, and was backed up well by Glenn McGrath, who took 2-15.Requiring 168 to win off 35 overs, Australia came out firing, scoring quickly before losing both Hayden and Justin Langer early. Ricky Ponting was joined by Michael Hussey, who was promoted to number four, and built a steady partnership before Ponting was dismissed for 49. Damien Martyn then fell cheaply, and Hussey was joined by Michael Clarke to complete the chase. The pair batted through to the total was reached, with Hussey scoring 61 not out. Australia reached the target with 19 balls to spare, at 6:45pm local time.No team had lost after declaring on as high a total batting first as England did in more than 125 years of Tests. As a Nine Network commentator described it, "Australia has just won the most extraordinary Test match; however, it was [a Test] that England should never have lost". Prior to the start of play, bookmakers had a draw paying $1.02.Australia now go into the third test at the WACA ground in Perth, Western Australia knowing one more win will reclaim the Ashes urn which they lost for the first time in over a decade in England during 2005.Australia has won the first test of The Ashes series against England by 239 runs at Lords in London. Rain threatened to halt the Australia's charge towards victory on Day Four but it held off long enough for Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne to together pick up the five required wickets for victory. Earlier, Australia's 9th and 10th wicket partnerships put on 95 runs between them, leaving England with the unlikely chase of 420 runs. McGrath bowled superbly in the test and finished with match figures of 9-82. The 35 year-old claimed his 500th test wicket in the first innings, placing him fourth on the all-time list. For the home team, debutant Kevin Pieterson scored 57 and 64 not out to ensure England were not thrashed.Scores: Australia 190 and 384, England 155 and 180Earlier today, Australia earned its first 2012 Summer Paralympics medal when Natalie Smith won a bronze medal with a score of 492.4 at the Royal Artillery Barracks in the women's R2-10m air rifle standing SH1 event.

Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!" and United States fans chanting "U-S-A! U-S-A!"  The United States's Jen Armbruster scored all three of the United States goals, one of them coming off a penalty shot. While the United States had no fouls in the game, Australia had four for high balls.The two teams played with contrasting styles.  The United States spent most of their time upright, only dropping and lunging to block the ball after the Australians threw it.  Meanwhile, the Australians spent most of their time low and close to the ground as they lunged to prevent the ball from going into the goal. The Australians, who were all wearing green and gold socks, were louder than the United States and talked to each other more while on court.Australia came into the match having lost 1–3 to both Japan and Canada. They have one game left to play at the London Paralympics when the play Sweden, who have lost 1–5 to the United States, tied Japan 0–0 and beaten Canada 2–1.With a 5–1 win against Sweden and a 1–2 loss to Japan, the United States still has to play Canada in pool play.Goalball was created in 1946 as a sport exclusively for people with a visual disability and designed to help veterans returning from World War II with their rehabilitation.  Games in the Paralympics have two twelve minute periods, with a three minute break between halves. Players are blindfolded to insure equal ability to see while on the court, and the game can be stopped to ensure goggles are properly fitted.  Standing in front of a long goal, they throw the ball at the opposition team's net who in turn try to block it by hearing the ball, which contains a bell, and using their bodies to prevent the ball from going in.  The audience is asked to remain silent during play.Australia's overnight penalty shootout 9–7 win against the Russia women's national water polo team qualified the Australia women's national water polo team into the quarter-finals of the FINA Women's World League Super Finals, where they will meet the Germany women's national water polo team at 9:00 p.m. AEST.Australia was behind at the end of the first quarter, with a score of 2–3.

Gourley is next set to compete at the Sochi Test event.Gourley  was the only Australian competitor at the Championships. His Australian teammates, including Jessica Gallagher, Melissa Perrine, Toby Kane, and Cameron Rahles Rahbula, missed the Championships either because they needed a small break from this season's competition schedule or to give themselves additional time to train for the Sochi Test event coming up next month.Brisbane, Queensland —Queensland Roar in Australia has advanced through to the 2008-9 A-League Preliminary Final, after defeating the Central Coast Mariners in their 2-leg Semi Final. Queensland will now travel to Adelaide for the Preliminary Final. In a top four finals series, which the A-League uses, the Preliminary Final is a final played between the qualifying Semi Final (1st vs. 2nd) and the winner of the elimination Semi Final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining spot in the Grand Final.Queensland lead one goal to zero after a back and forth first half. The Mariners pressed early keeping Queensland to their own half in the first three minutes. Queensland created a number of opportunities down the other end to no avail. The Queenslanders missed from a corner and were unlucky to have an offside decision go against them. Michael Zullo fired off a shot from close range only for it to be saved.The Mariners fired right back. They secured a free kick 20 metres out from goal. The kick went was saved and resulted in a corner. Queensland cleared the ball from their penalty area. The Mariners jumped on a number of Queensland mistakes, taking three shots on goal in the space of two minutes.Queensland then applied pressure down the Mariners end resulting in a goal to Mitchell Nichols.

Australia drew 0–0 with Qatar, Japan defeated Uzbekistan 1–0, South Korea qualified by defeating the United Arab Emirates 2–0 and a 2–1 win over Iceland saw the Netherlands qualify. All four countries have two games to play in qualifying."They put us under pressure," Australia coach Pim Verbeek said of his team's games. "We thought they could only do that for 20 minutes and they did it for almost 90 so I have to congratulate the young players from Qatar. They made it very difficult for us."In a statement emailed out to the media, Football Federation Australia CEO Ben Buckley said, "It's another first for Australian football, and it's come off the back of a comprehensive qualification pathway which began in February last year. Qualifying this time around, with the travel and match conditions the team has experienced, is a true measure of the progress football has made. While 'do or die' results, such as the famous Uruguay game four years ago are exciting, a qualifying campaign such as this one through the Asian zone is a tough test."FIFA named the Japan-Uzbekistan game as match of the day. Japanese forward Shinji Okazaki scored the only goal of that match, securing Japan's place at the World Cup."This away game was really tough but I'm really happy, because I'd only scored in friendly games previously," Okazaki said. "This time, I feel like I did very well for the Japanese team."Japan are a big team — both on and off the field — who have become a major force in world football. We are delighted that they today became the first team to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup," Danny Jordaan, World Cup organising committee chief, said.South Korea opened the scoring in there match with the UAE through Park Chu-young after five minutes. Ki Sung-yueng sealed qualification for the Koreans on 37 minutes.The Netherlands scored their two goals in the first ten minutes. Nigel de Jong scored after eight minutes and Mark van Bommel scored on 15 minutes.Yarralumla, Australia — Members of the Australian Adaptive Rowing team, consisting of Kathryn Ross, Erik Horrie, and John Maclean, are currently finalising their Australian based training for the paralympics on the waters of Lake Burley Griffin, Canberra. Our reporters interviewed Erik Horrie, an arms and shoulder (AS) single scull competitor, who is moving towards his first paralympics. We asked about his preperations, and the sport in general. Horrie , 32, says that he is hoping for strong results for the team in the preceding third rowing world cup mid June in Munich. 2011, Horrie's debut year rowing at a national level after a background in wheelchair basketball, saw him place fourth in his first world cup event. In a Canberra winter, temperatures routinely remain sub-zero as athletes prepare, early morning, on the water. Horrie commented that despite conditions, a far cry from those found by his Queensland-based "Dragons" club, he trains six times a week, including strength sessions at the nearby Australian Institute of Sport [AIS] facilities, and cross training. Funding for the sport has increased significantly in Australia in recent years, especially since it's introduction to the paralympics in Beijing. Horrie commented that competitive successes have seen a increase in funding toward the program.  A substantial allocation allowed the AIS to host four athletes on site and secure a second fleet of boats for their European base. Rowing equipment comes at a substantial cost with an eight costing fifty five thousand dollars. Finding athletes is a primary focus, especially with the limited pool of disabled athletes to draw upon, and the AIS runs active talent searching programs. Horrie told Wikinews reporters that despite increasing media attention his focus remains on fun.Tuggeranong, Canberra — Nineteen year old Australian Shadow Olympic team member Alice Ingley was attending the second day of the National Archery Championships, a few days before the start of the target recurve event that she hopes to represent Australia at the Olympics in. Injuries may impact her chances, but in an interview with her, she did not think it would be a big problem.The archer found out about her inclusion on the shadow team the night after returning from a concert by her favorite band, Celtic Thunder, in Wollongong.The National Championships have possible Olympic qualification implications for Ingley as there are more girls on the shadow squad than eligible to compete on the full team at the Olympics, so cuts will be made based on performance at the event.  From here, the three Australian women chosen to represent Australia will compete at the archery team event qualifier in the United States six weeks before the 2012 London Games.  The possibility of individual qualification at the Games is another important part of the event, as Australia has only secured one spot for a female archer.The only Olympic archery event is the target recurve competition, and it is the only event Ingley will be participating in at Nationals.  She has competed in field recurve but is not competing to maximize her training for Olympic inclusion.  She is hyper focused on the sport at the moment, with archery being her life.Ingley, who might be related to the historical Robin Hood, is not a stranger to high level international competition, having competed at the 2010 Youth Olympics.  This event was the only time she enjoyed substantial media interest, as otherwise archery is largely ignored by the Australian press. She has also competed at the first Youth Olympics, the Junior World Cup and two senior World Cups. She has also participated at the 2011 University Games in China and the 2011 Olympic Test Event in London.She has an American doppelganger, Miranda Leek, and the two are sometimes mistaken for each other at international competitions.She is a member of the Yokine Archery Club in Western Australia. Previously, for two and a half years, she had been affiliated with the archery program at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), but poor performances by the national team and other considerations led to the AIS dropping their high performance archery sport.Ingley cannot drive, as she has not had the time to learn because of her archery focus. When not competing in archery, she works for Western Australian Newspapers. She deferred university for a year to try to realize her Olympic dream, taking time off from Edith Cowan University where she was working on a Bachelors of Arts in History.Tuggeranong, Canberra — Australian Shadow Olympic team member Odette Snazelle was in Tuggeranong ahead of Thursday and Friday's National Archery Championship target recurve event.She believes she will do well at Nationals when competing in her event, target archery with a recurve bow, but that the top women are all very evenly matched and push each other to continually improve. Snazelle would not guarantee victory.Earlier this year, Snazelle shot a national record for FITA 70/720 with a score of 652.Participation in the Nationals is basically a compulsory event for Shadow Olympic Team members, as they have possible Olympic qualification implications for Snazelle as there are more girls on the shadow squad than eligible to compete on the full team at the Olympics, so cuts will be made based on performance at the event. On top of that, selection for the World Cup will be made based on the results of this event.The seventeen year old from Sydney, who will celebrate her eighteenth in April, was asked about the lack of media coverage for the sport and said it related to the relative lack of popularity of archery in Australia.  Movies like Robin Hood raise the visibility of the sport and temporarily bring in more participants.  She got into sport threes years ago, after watching her former Australian national championship father participate at a local club.  Just sitting there and watching got boring so starting to play while at the club was a good way to pass time.Snazelle finished her HSCs last year and deferred admissions to the University of Sydney where she will major in engineering and medicine with the goal of becoming a neuroscientist for a year in order to further her Olympic dreams.  She had originally planned to apply to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and had looked at continuing competing while in the United States but did not want to lose opportunities for national representation by being available for national competitions.She is learning to drive but because of her busy archery schedule and because, according to Snazelle, Sydney drivers are crazy, she has yet to get her license.  When not competing, she works at DVD rental shop.Belconnen, Australian Capital Territory — Earlier today at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), Australian Paralympic Committee President Greg Hartung and the Federal Minister for Sport Kate Lundy formally unveiled the Australian Centre for Paralympic Excellence.The unveiling ceremony started with a speech by Hartung who mentioned how important the AIS was to the Paralympic movement in Australia, with the first Paralympic scholarship holder being Russell Short, who earned his scholarship in 1988 and has subsequently competed in six Paralympic Games, with this year's Games making seven.  Hartung went on to discuss how many more Paralympians have subsequently been supported by the AIS, including Matthew Cowdrey who credits an AIS run recovery centre at the 2008 Summer Paralympics with enabling him to win a gold medal.Lundy's speech followed Hartung's.  She highlighted how the AIS specifically supports five Paralympic programs including rowing, athletics, alpine skiing, and swimming.  Beyond those, the AIS, with funding assistance from the federal government, provided AUD$13.5 million to support the Paralympics for goalball, cycling, and weightlifting, with an additional AUD$2.25 million going to grants to support Paralympians directly through Direct Athlete Support grants.Following Lundy's speech, the Australian Paralympic Centre of Excellence sign was unveiled. There are 44 days left until the start of the Paralympic Games.Australian cheerleaders have been told today to cover up their midriffs under calls by Gymnastics Australia, as they believe it encourages girls to be self-conscious.Nerine Cooper, head of Gymnastics Australia, told the Sunday Telegraph, "We don't want girls to feel under pressure to lose weight because of uniforms." Lisa Ince, head of Sydney Professional Dancers, disagreed. "It's ridiculous really, if the thinking is that a midriff is offensive, then every dance school and athletics club would face the same restrictions," she said.The ban will affect about 150 teams registered with Gymnastics Australia.Australia have defeated India by 84 runs in the second ODI match of Australia's current tour of India at Nehru Stadium, Kochi, India.Australia lead the 7-match ODI series 1-0, after the first match was abandoned due to rain.After the first over, Australia were already one wicket down after Adam Gilchrist was dismissed for a duck. And shortly into the third over, things were not looking good for Australia, after Brad Hodge was caught behind for only 3 runs, and the figures were 2 wickets for eight runs. But things started improving with Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke sharing a 54 run partnership before Clarke was stumped for 27. Hayden then, along with Andrew Symonds, blasted a 94 run partnership before being bowled by Irfan Pathan, making a total of 75 runs. Symonds was caught and bowled by fast-bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth in the 46th over after making 87 runs, and a 108-run parnership with Brad Haddin. Three overs later James Hopes was the third and final victim of Sreesanth after being caught by Rahul Dravid. Haddin survived the innings with 87 not-out, along with Brett Lee who achieved 2 runs.India lost its first wicket shortly into the third over with Mitch Johnson bowling Gautam Gambhir for 7 runs. India didn't lose another wicket until Symonds caught a Stuart Clark bowled ball off Sachin Tendulkar. Clark then claimed a LBW on Robin Uthappa for 41 runs. Dravid (31) then fell in the 25th over, and one over later - Pathan (1) who was run out by Clarke. Harbhajan Singh was then stumped for 4, while Ramesh Powar (17) was bowled by Clark. Zaheer Khan (3) was then caught, and India was all out when captain Mahendra Dhoni was also caught during the 47th over after making the highest score of the innings - 58. Sreesanth remained with not out for 7 runs.Toss: India won, and chose to field first.Fall of wickets: 1-3 (Gilchrist, 0.6 ov), 2-8 (Hodge, 3.1 ov), 3-66 (Clarke, 15.3 ov), 4-160 (Hayden, 31.1 ov), 5-268 (Symonds, 46.5 ov), 6-297 (Hopes, 49.2 ov)Did not bat: Brad Hogg, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson Fall of wickets: 1-11 (Gambhir, 3.1 ov), 2-58 (Tendulkar, 8.5 ov), 3-79 (Yuvraj Singh, 11.4 ov), 4-87 (Uthappa, 14.2 ov), 5-136 (Dravid, 25.1 ov), 6-139 (Pathan, 26.6 ov), 7-154 (Harbhajan Singh, 30.3 ov), 8-179 (Powar, 34.6 ov), 9-190 (Khan, 39.2 ov), 10-222 (Dhoni, 47.3 ov)India: M S Dhoni (capt, wkt), R Dravid, G Gambhir, Z Khan, I K Pathan, R R Powar, H Singh, Y Singh, S Sreesanth, S R Tendulkar, R V UthappaAustralia: S R Clark, M J Clarke, A C Gilchrist (capt, wkt), B J Haddin, M L Hayden, B J Hodge, G B Hogg, J R Hopes, M G Johnson, B Lee, A SymondsMan of the Match: B J Haddin (Australia)Umpires: S A Bucknor (West Indies) and S L Shastri (India)TV Umpire: GA Pratapkumar (India)Match Referee: B C Broad (England)Reserve Umpire: S K Tarapore (India)Australian Prime Minister John Howard said his government has decided to not let the national cricket team go to Zimbabwe."We don't do this lightly, but we are convinced that for the tour to go ahead there would be an enormous propaganda boost for the Mugabe regime," Howard told ABC television. "The [Robert] Mugabe regime at present is behaving like the Gestapo towards its political opponents, the living standards of the country are probably the lowest of any in the world and you have an unbelievable rate of inflation."Reactions from Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe came quickly."The Australians are mixing politics with sport and the decision shows how desperate the Howard government is to isolate Zimbabwe," junior information minister Bright Matonga told Agence France-Presse."Australia is one of the worst human rights violators in this whole world. Look what they have done to the aborigines and yet they have the audacity to stand up and claim to have the moral authority to condemn us. This is also a racist ploy to kill our local cricket since our cricket team is now dominated by black players as we slowly transform cricket from being an elite sport."Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes has died in St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney today (Thursday, local time). Hughes was playing a Sheffield Shield match for South Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground when he was struck in the neck by a bouncer."It is my sad duty to inform you that a short time ago Phillip Hughs passed away," said Australian national team doctor Peter Brukner in a statement.As the news broke, condolences came from around Australia's sporting community."A sad, sad day. Absolutely devastating. Thoughts go out to Phillip Hughes' family and friends.  #RIPPhillipHughes," Australian women's captain Meg Lanning tweeted."Our thoughts are with Philip’s family and everyone affected by this tragic accident," said Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop."The West Australian Football Commission [WAFC] on behalf of football in WA extends sincere sympathies to the family and friends of Phillip Hughes," tweeted the WAFC.Today was meant to be the third day of the Sheffield Shield match Hughes was involved in. The entire round of matches was abandoned after the incident.On Wednesday, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced Australian cricketers David Warner and Steve Smith were banned from this year's Indian Premier League (IPL) after the ball tampering incident in a Cape Town test match versus South Africa.The ban imposed by the Committee of Administrators, appointed by the Indian Supreme Court, came a day after Cricket Australia (CA) announced Warner and Smith were banned from international as well as domestic cricket in Australia for a year for breaking Cricket Australia's code of conduct — violating spirit of the game — per Article 2.3.5, and Cameron Bancroft received a similar ban from CA for nine months.In a statement, BCCI said, "The BCCI hopes that the cricketers participating in the IPL hold the highest regard for the Spirit of Cricket and Code of Conduct for Players and Match Officials." This dissolved AU$2.4 million contracts of the two. Smith and Warner had vacated their positions as Rajasthan Royals' and Sunrisers Hyderabad's captains earlier.BCCI's President CK Khanna, IPL Chairman Rajeev Shukla and BCCI Secretary Amitabh Choudhary were consulted by the Committee of Administrators for the ban.Rajasthan Royals named Indian batsman Ajinkya Rahane as the new captain, while Sunrisers Hyderabad announced New Zealand's Kane Williamson as the captain. Both the franchise are allowed to make replacements, BCCI had said in the statement. Warner was the highest run-scorer in last year's IPL and won the 2016 edition of IPL with Hyderabad. This year's IPL is to start on April 7.Cameron Bancroft was banned for nine months for actually tampering with the match ball, instructed by David Warner. Bancroft later mislead the match officials when he was caught tampering with the ball. The sanctions by CA include Warner never to be considered for Australia's captain for demonstrating and instructing a junior player how to tamper with the ball. Bancroft, and captain Steve Smith, who knew about the misconduct, but did not act to prevent it, as well as tried to cover up the matter, may be considered for the captaincy after two years.Bancroft, who was seen rubbing the match ball with something, later identified as sandpaper, said, "I'm not proud of what's happened and I have to live with the consequences and the damage to my own reputation that comes with". Initially, when Bancroft was seen tampering with the ball, he lied to on-field match umpires Richard Illingworth and Nigel Llong that the instrument used was sticky tape, rather than sandpaper, and he was using it to apply granules to the ball. Bancroft said, "I saw an opportunity to potentially use some tape and get some granules from the rough patches on the wicket and I guess try to change the ball condition [...] It didn't work. The umpires didn't change the ball. Once I was sighted on the screen having done that I panicked quite a lot and that obviously resulted in me shoving [the tape] down my trousers." Sandpaper is prohibited to be used with the match ball, however it is used to smooth the cricket bat.Smith said the decision to change the ball was made during Day 3's lunch break. Eventually, South Africa went on to win the match by 322 runs as they lead the series 2–1. For altering the ball conditions, the International Cricket Council (ICC) fined Bancroft 75% of the match wage. Bancroft violated ICC's Article 2.2.9, "changing the condition of the ball".On Thursday, Warner posted a tweet apologising the cricket fans. He said, "Mistakes have been made which damaged cricket. I apologise for my part and take responsibility of it." On social media, Steve Smith said, "I made a serious error of judgement and I now understand the consequences. It was a failure of my leadership. I will do everything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused".CA named Tim Paine as the captain on Tuesday. The three sanctioned were sent back to Australia on Wednesday. Glenn Maxwell, Joe Burns and Matthew Renshaw were called for the team as replacements. Bancroft, Smith and Warner can appeal the sanctions within one week. The sanctioning CA board consisted of former Australian Test players Mark Taylor and Michael Kasprowicz as well as Cricket Australia's Chairman David Peever, Earl Eddings, Dr Bob Every, John Harnden, Tony Harrison, Jacquie Hey, and Michelle Tredenick.Australian Eddie Jones was named on Friday as England's new rugby union head coach by the Rugby Football Union (RFU), making him the first foreign coach to be appointed to the role. Jones has signed a four year contract after Stuart Lancaster resigned from the post in early November following England's disappointing performance at this year's Rugby World Cup.Jones, 55, is to leave a position he was appointed to only two months ago as coach of Cape Town's Stormers in South Africa. Jones said: "The opportunity to take the reins in possibly the world’s most high-profile international rugby job doesn’t come along every day however, and I feel fortunate to be given the opportunity."Jones led Australian side Brumbies to the first Super 12 win by a non-New Zealand team. While he was head coach of Australia they won the Tri Nations and were finalists against England at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He was also assistant to South Africa the year of their 2007 World Cup win. His Japan side, with ten consecutive victories, broke the record for the number of successive wins for a second tier rugby union team. His first game as England head coach is to be against Scotland in the Six Nations Championship at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh on February 6.Chief Executive of the RFU Ian Ritchie said he is confident Jones has the right credentials for the role. "We promised to recruit a coach with proven international experience and we have done that. Eddie is a world-class coach, with extensive experience at the highest level with Australia, South Africa and Japan."Tuggeranong, Canberra — The second day of the Australian National Archery Championships was underway today at the Tuggeranong Archery Club in Canberra, with the field shooting competition being one of the highlights, as Australians in several bow classes were attempting to qualify for the World Archery Field Championships in August.  Competitors need to meet a minimum score and finish in the top three in their class to earn a nomination from Archery Australia to go on to World Championship.  The long bow class archers were competing for national honors because they are not eligible to participate at World Championships.Twenty-four targets were used for the competition with enough archers in groups of three to four to cover almost all of them at any one time.Eliza Banard, Trudy Scott, Leanne Strahan from Victoria and Frances Atkins from the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were some of the day's female competitors looking to qualify for the World Championships.  Victorian Cliff Sharkey, and Canberran Mick Turner were amongst the male competitors, shooting with long or bare bows.   Other male competitors included Bruce Lang, Joe Vardon and Rodney Cosolloe.Mickey Fisher was a Canberra archer who smashed a national record on the first day of the competition.Kirsten Filmer and her husband were one of several pairs of husband and wife competitors hoping to jointly gain selection to the World Championships. Archery Australia board members were also amongst the competitors today, including Jim Larven, the CEO of Archery Australia.  While not eligible for the World Championships, he competed because he loves participating in the sport.Strahan is a Victorian competitor on the state team.  Unlike the potential female Olympic competitors in the target event, she works full time and can drive.  She does not have a rigorous training regime, believing the route to success in archery is to shoot as often as you possibly can.Field archery is not an Olympic archery event; only target recurve is. Recurve bows are used in field archery competitions, alongside long bows and compound bows, and bows with sites and bows without sights.  In field archery, the bow type is important beyond just competition class; it also dictates the distance the shooter stands from the target.  The archers with recurve and compound bows who were shooting with long bow shooters would shoot first as they had a greater distance to the target because their bows had greater accuracy from distance. Archery fights to stay on the Olympic programme because of low spectator numbers and one of the smaller participation bases.  After almost every Games, there are discussions about dropping the sport.  As a result, there have been a number of changes designed to make the sport more spectator and camera friendly. Archery organisrs have narrowed the field to have only two lanes to allow spectators to be as close to the action as possible.  They have also adjusted the distances for shooting.  Archery improved their announcing at the Games to make the sport more accessible to a broader audience.  They also reduced the number of eligible teams from sixteen to twelve in order to speed up the play. In conversations with Stuart Atkins, the event's field manager, Wikinews learned there are few Paralympic archers in Australia, with none competing at the National Championships.  Australian disability archers tend to do well in national competitions against able bodied competitors.  Australia also has a few blind archers, who shoot with the assistance of a target that makes a sound to allow for targeting, and a sighted guide to retrieve arrows and score them.Several archers were asked why they were involved with archery instead of shooting.  Most said they preferred the physical nature of archery.  They also said some archers did both sports, with a preference towards pistol shooting in shooting events.  Legal issues with guns in Australia have pushed some sport shooters out of the sport and into archery.  Archery has another advantage over shooting sport in Australia in that archery clubs can be located in a city center, while shooting ranges need to be outside city limits.  Archers are hesitant to discuss this issue too much though, as they fear the government who have tried before will try to license bow owning.The funding to host the National Archery Championships is largely shared by the club hosting the competition, as is the case with Canberra who received no funding from the local government for the event.  In the case of the Australian Capital Territory though, the territory government has supported the building of archery related facilities including their current stadium purpose built as a 2000 Summer Games training facility.  The government is also paying the majority of the AUD$2 million for a multisport facility in Tuggeranong.The National Archery Championships will continue until Friday evening at the Tuggeranong Archery Club.The Australian Football League (AFL) yesterday announced that it would hold an exhibition game in Shanghai, China. Brisbane will play Melbourne at Jiangwan Sports Centre in the Yangpu District.AFL game development head David Matthews told reporters, "[t]here are big opportunities here [in China] to improve our broadcast position and consider China as an events market. I think we have got the best game in the world, the most spectacular game in the world."The AFL had previously told Wikinews that they had no plans to stage such a game.Chinese broadcaster Shanghai Media Group will broadcast the match to approximately 20 million homes in southern China. The broadcaster will send a team to a Round One game between Richmond and Carlton to better understand how to broadcast the game.Earlier today in a twelfth round Australian Football League game played in rainy Sydney, the Richmond Tigers beat the expansion GWS Giants by a score of 11.20.86 to 12.2.74.Jeremy Cameron led the Giants in scoring with three goals. Rhys Palmer and Toby Greene each scored a pair of goals. Jonathon Patton, making his first appearance with the team, scored a goal.  On the Tigers side, Daniel Connors led in scoring with three goals and one behind, while Jack Riewoldt also scored three goals.According to the Australian Associated Press, a Richmond loss would have been embarrassing for the finals aspirants, a feat the team avoided by attempting 17 more goals than their opposition. In other games this round: the West Coast Eagles beat the Carlton Blues 79–69 in Perth; the Adelaide Crows beat the St. Kilda Saints 115–111 in Adelaide.Australian Football League clubs in Melbourne have threatened to move their matches interstate after a breakdown in negotiations over poor stadium deals at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Western Bulldogs president David Smorgon, who was acting as the delegate for the league's sixteen clubs, said that Victorian teams would consider moving matches interstate or to Visy Park in Carlton."It's an idea, nothing threatening," Smorgon said. "But we're not going to sit back and do nothing. We've got other options and they include engaging our fans and briefing the 360,000 members we have".Both options - playing at Visy Park and interstate - were conditional on a fairer deal for clubs not being struck. Clubs stressed, at a meeting with the AFL, that they did not want to resort to those measure."We've talked about such things as writing to all of our fans, all of our members, explaining it to them, so they get a full understanding of it, about the seriousness of the situation," Smorgon said. "We've talked about maybe Victorian clubs have to play a game or two interstate, but these are just a range of options that we do have. But we want to back in the Government again, to go back and see whether they can have another go at getting a fairer deal".James Merlino, the Victorian state Sports Minister, responded by stating that the government had already spent $176 million on AFL football, and that "no code gets better support in either the grassroots or the elite from the Government than AFL football".The AFL and its clubs are asking the Victorian government for AU$8 million a year in additional funding.Adelaide United will play in the A-League football preliminary final Queensland Roar in Adelaide on Saturday night. In a top four finals series, which the A-League uses, the preliminary final is a final played between the qualifying Semi Final (1st vs. 2nd) and the winner of the elimination Semi Final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining spot in the Grand Final.Adelaide qualified after losing to Melbourne Victory in the major semi final. Queensland qualified after winning the minor semi final against the Central Coast Mariners.Adelaide United opened the scoring at the 25 minute mark through midfielder Fabian Barbiero. Barbiero's shot, which sailed into the top lefthand corner of goal, came from just outside the 18 yard box off to the right of the goals."I thought we were most probably the better team but we were beaten by a wonder strike, it was a fantastic strike," said Queensland coach Frank Farina.Queensland rallied in the second half and continually took shots on goal. However, an indifferent Adelaide kept them out. Serginho Van Dijk fired some inaccurate shots while Mitch Nichols had a low trajectory shot saved by Adelaide keeper Eugene Galekovic."That's the biggest disappointment. The grand final's not a disappointment, to be totally honest," Farina said. "It's not qualifying for Asia, that was the biggest prize tonight. It's disappointing, but if we keep this current squad together it'll happen. We'll get to Asia and we'll get to a grand final."Adelaide will now play Melbourne Victory in the Grand Final at the Telstra Dome.Melbourne Victory has won the A-League Grand Final against Adelaide United at the Telstra Dome. Melbourne came into the match with a 6-0 (2-0, 4-0) win over Adelaide United in their two legged semi final. Adelaide United came into the match with a win against Queensland Roar in the preliminary final.The A-League uses the Page playoff system where the winner of the major semi final (1st vs. 2nd) qualifies for the grand final, while the loser plays the winner of the minor semi final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining place.Melbourne midfielder Tom Pondeljak scored the only goal for the match with a long range strike on sixty minutes.Adelaide were reduced to ten men after ten minutes when Cristiano landed a clumsy elbow to the head of an opposing player. Melbourne was reduced to ten men twenty minutes from time when Danny Allsopp was sent off due to a late fracas."It was a great performance. Adelaide were great, they pushed us right to the death but I think we deserved it," Melbourne captain Kevin Muscat said. "Down to 10 men it was a very difficult game for us but the amount of courage and heart the boys showed tonight to get through the game and keep fighting to the end was fantastic. I couldn't ask any more.""It's one of those things I guess, it changed the game, but what can you do about it now?" Adelaide Captain Travis Dodd told Fox Sports after the match. "We worked hard to keep it scoreless until half-time, to keep our discipline and keep our shape and keep doing what we were doing."Homebush Bay, New South Wales —Earlier today at the Sport Centre at the Sydney Olympic Park, the Australian Gliders beat the Germany women's national wheelchair basketball team 53–45.Germany took an early lead in the game after winning the opening tip-off.  They pulled ahead 5–0 before Australia was able to answer back with a two point shot by 3 point player Sarah Stewart.  Australia went on a 16-point unanswered scoring run, beating Germany 16–5 with 1:21 left in the first before the Germans were able to score off a basketball by Gesche Schünemann to bring Germany to 7–17. Germany attempted to battle back, but had let Australia gain a lead of 30–18 by the end of the first half.  Germany narrowed this further to 37–32 at the end of the third period.  Australia held on to finish the game 53–45.The Gliders are to play the Chinese team tomorrow morning at 10:00am Sydney time.Homebush Bay, New South Wales —Earlier today, the Australian Gliders beat the Chinese women's national wheelchair basketball team 57–45 at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge taking place at the Sport Centre at the Sydney Olympic Park.China won the game's opening tip off but did not score in their first time down the floor.  Australia's Sarah Stewart took and missed Australia's first shot.  China's 1.5 point player Li Yanhua eventually made the game's first basket. Cobi Crispin made Australia's first basket at 6:55 left in the first quarter, successfully turning her basket into a three point play by making her free throw as a result of a personal foul.  Aggressive first quarter play resulted in four Chinese personal fouls with 5:21 left.  The first quarter ended 13–9 in China's favour.The first half ended 24–20, with China leading.  China's lead came with a high level of energy, the bench loudly supporting their players, few substitutions, lots of on the court talk, playing a half court game that involved setting up the defense early and fouling.  In contrast, Australia played a different first half.  The team did not yell from the bench or on the court, had many substitutions, ran the shot clock down and played a full court defense.The second half contrasted visibly with the first. Fewer fouls were made by both teams. Australia continued to run the shot clock down but their bench woke up, started cheering loudly for their teammates and made fewer substitutions.  The Australians tied the game 34–34 with 1:54 left in the third quarter.  China's answer to the closer game was to start substituting players.  Tactically, things were little changed as neither team changed their defensive game.  The game was tied again at 9:01 left in the fourth with a score of 38–38.  Australia was up 42–38 at 7:14 left in the fourth.  Some of China's defensive difficulties continued to hold them back, including a player who entered the box early for a second time during a free throw shot by an Australian player.The Gliders will play tomorrow at 2:30pm Sydney time in the first place match against an opponent to be determined in a game later today between Germany and Japan.Homebush Bay, New South Wales —Yesterday, the Australian Gliders beat the German women's national wheelchair basketball team 48–46 in the first place match at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge taking place at the Sport Centre at the Sydney Olympic Park.The two teams were close most of the game, with the first quarter ending 11–6 Germany, second quarter ending tied 19–19 and the third quarter ending 31–27.

On another fast break opportunity, Germany again scored with  Edina Muller leveling the score at 42–42. German frustration set in at the 1:18 mark when Marina Mohnen  got a technical foul for unsportsman-like conduct, and then topped that off with a second technical foul.

Yin He of China took gold, and Alyda Norbruis of the Netherlands won a silver.C1 classified Paris pushed the other riders, setting a world record for her classification with a time of 45.449 seconds and factored time of 40.476 seconds.  This bettered her own world and Paralympic record she set at the 2008 Summer Paralympics with a time of 46.427 seconds. C2 classified He also set a classification world record in her ride, with a time of 42.448 seconds and factored time of 39.158 seconds.While the Blacktown, New South Wales native was on the track, the commentator led spectators in chanting with the traditional "Aussie-Aussie-Aussie", where spectators respond "Oi-Oi-Oi".  There were two big Australian flags waving during the race, with fans cheering loudly in support of the Australian rider.On the first day of competition, Paris finished eighth in the Women's Individual C1-2-3 Pursuit Qualification race and did not qualify for the finals despite setting a world record time of 4:40.123 in her classification.Sunday, the NFL's Seattle Seahawks drafted Brisbane, Australia native nose tackle Jesse Williams in the fifth round of the NFL Draft.  Going into the draft, there were some expectations by the Brisbane Times and other media outlets that Williams might be selected in the first round.  Injuries, which resulted in Williams being unable to participate fully in the NFL Combine, likely were reasons why he was not selected higher.Gridiron football is not the most popular football code in Australia, with rugby league, rugby union, soccer, and Australian rules football all being more popular participation sports.  Williams' youth sporting career reflected this, with Williams playing rugby union until he was 15 years old at which time he switched codes and joined the local gridiron team, the Bayside Ravens.  A year later, his playing ability earned him a scholarship offer from the University of Hawaii.  He could not meet the university's academic standards so eventually he attended Western Arizona Community College instead.  In 2011, he transferred to the University of Alabama and played for the Alabama Crimson Tide for two seasons. Both seasons, his Crimson Tide team won the national championship.Williams' selection is unique amongst Australians as most Australians who have played in the NFL have been kickers.  He is also only the second Australian ever to be drafted in the NFL Draft.One of Australia's leading jockeys Stathi Katsidis has been found dead at the age of 31. He was found dead on Tuesday morning by his fiancee, Melissa Jackson. Katsidis died less than a week before he was due to ride in the Cox Plate and was set to ride in the Melbourne cup in November. He was going to be riding former Australian Derby winner Shoot Out.Born in Toowoomba, Katsidis had recorded over 170 victories last season. He had success in both the Australian Derby and the Group One Randwick Guineas. He suffered a knock back in 2008 when he was banned for nine months after testing positive for ecstasy. He had previously battled drug and weight problems in the past.Tributes have been paid to Katsidis both jockey's and trainers. John Wallace, the trainer of Shoot Out said "He told me he couldn't wait to get to Melbourne and that he'd be down on Thursday. It's a total shock." Jockey Corey Brown said "He was a terrific guy, loaded with ability and is going to be sadly missed."Police have said that no suspicious circumstances surrounding Katsidis death. His fiancee has said that she suspects alcohol to be a factor in his death. Katsidis had been out drinking with friends on the night before his death. "Jockeys have to lose so much weight. Their bodies are drained like anorexic young girls. Then some of them go out and try drinking like men with big, strong bodies. It hits them like a brick wall. I just hope some of the other jockeys get a message from this." His funeral has been set for next Tuesday; exact plans have yet to be released.Bruce, Canberra — On Monday, at a press conference at the Australian Institute of Sport on the first day of an Opals training camp, the media asked questions supporting this Olympic cycle's storyline that the Australian team is going to the 2012 Summer Olympics for a gold medal rematch between Australia and the United States women's national basketball team, who are once again in separate Olympic pools for the tournament. Media organisations present included Fox Sports, WIN News, the Canberra Times, and Wikimedia Australia including our reporter. The press at the first press conference consisted of a female print journalist, four video cameras behind the two rows of seats allocated for the media, and three microphones in front of the table occupied by the national team coach Carrie Graf and national team members Lauren Jackson and Jenna O'Hea.  The media contingent largely asked questions about Australia's quest for a gold medal, how worried the Australians were about the team from the United States and how much planning the team was doing in preparation to play them in the gold medal finals for the fourth time in a row.  These questions mirrored an ongoing theme in the media coverage found in television media and newspaper coverage of portraying the team as one of Australia's few serious medal contenders.  The other focus was on early game against Great Britain women's national basketball team, who are in the same pool as Australia, who will have an advance of playing on their home ground with at least one dual-Australian/British passport holder on the United Kingdom team and a former Australian national women's team coach leading the opposition's side.In contrast to media questions from television and print reporters present, Graf, Jackson and O'Hea's responses made clear their goal was in the present. The coach and players were thinking about who would survive the cuts to make the team, establishing a good team dynamic and preparing for teams early in their Olympic campaign.  The Australian side was not thinking ahead to the gold medal round as they believe their competition is good enough to be a worry. The press directed most of their questions to Jackson and Graf, with O'Hea only asked a question late in the press conference.Following the press conference, Fox Sports interviewed one of the Opals in a one-on-one interview.  Another reporter followed up with Basketball Australia's media representative to ask additional questions.In the opening session for the camp, a video photographer lined up a basketball to get a shot of a basketball in the foreground while Jackson and Suzy Batkovic-Brown shot baskets in the background.The Opals had a training session open to the media early in the day, with six journalists recording in various media how players participated in several drills including a drill where the Opals, working in groups of three on three different courts, had one minute to attempt and make as many two point field goals as possible. In one drill set, Jennifer Snell made 22 of 28 attempts.The final media open training session of the day, starting late in the afternoon, saw only a pair of Wikimedia Australia photographers and a Basketball Australia photographer present. The rest of the media had left much earlier in the day. The media open training camp will continue through until Friday, before the team starts a two week long training camp that will be closed to the media but not before two players are cut from a squad currently 19 strong that will be pared down to 12 by the end of next month.Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center, Bangkok —The Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Rollers, and the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, won gold medals on Friday, the final day of the Asia–Oceania Zone Wheelchair Basketball Championships in Bangkok, Thailand.  The eight day championship was opened on November 22. Ten countries competed for places at the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) World Championships next year — ten in the men's: Japan, Iran, China, Malaysia, Taipei, Australia, Korea, Kuwait, New Zealand and Thailand; and four in the women's: Australia, Japan, China and Thailand. For the Australians, it was a rare opportunity to play teams from neighboring countries. Their efforts to help other teams were appreciated; after one game the Kuwait men led a cheer of "Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!" To which the Thai women replied: "Oi! Oi! Oi!" Both the Australian teams went through the tournament undefeated. The Gliders defeated China in the gold medal game 57–35. The Rollers then took to the court and defeated Korea 63–46. Iran and Japan won the men's and women's bronze medal matches.This was one of four zone championships. The zones correspond to those of the IPC and FIBA: Americas, Europe, Asia–Oceania and Africa. Each zone is guaranteed one place at the World Championships. Under recently-introduced rules, performance at the Paralympic games gains additional spots for the zone, not for the country. Only the home team is guaranteed a place.The new zone system has already proved controversial, with Algeria  defeating South Africa in the recent Africa Zone Championships in Angola to grab the sole spot allocated to Africa, and Canada missing out on one of the four men's spots for the Americas zone. In a shock result, these places went to the United States, Argentina, Mexico and Colombia. Great Britain, Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands are to round out the championships as the men's teams from the European Zone.The men's World Championship are to be held in July next year in Incheon, South Korea, while the women's are to be in Toronto, Canada. Maureen Orchard. President and Secretary General of the IWBF told Wikinews the women's competition will in no way be inferior to the men's. The women are to be put up in a five-star hotel, and play at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens. Without their men's team competing, the women's competition is expected to generate considerable interest in Canada. The home team is to be joined by teams from the Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, France, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru to compete against the winners from the Asia–Oceania Zone.The sport of wheelchair basketball has great popularity. In London, additional seats at the North Greenwich Arena sold out online within minutes.Australian Mitchell Dean won the Honolulu Triathlon on Sunday, defeating American Manuel Huerta by five seconds to win the event in 1 hour, 46 minutes, and 55 seconds.Huerta came in second at 1 hour and 47 minutes flat, and Haven Barnes finished third at 1 hour, 47 minutes, and 6 seconds.In the women's race, Jasmine Oeinck of Littleton, Colorado won in 1 hour, 56 minutes, and 21 seconds.  Sarah Groff finished second in 1 hour, 57 minutes, and 18 seconds; and Sara McLarty finished third in 1 hour, 58 minutes, and 8 seconds.Dean and Oeinck both earned US$3,000 for their victories.About 900 triathletes entered the event, which includes a 1.5 km swim at Ala Moana Beach Park just west of Waikiki, a 40 km out-and-back bicycle leg along Nimitz Highway to Aloha Stadium, and a 10 km run around Ala Moana Beach Park and Kewalo Basin.  About 250 fewer athletes entered this year, a drop attributed to local triathletes concerned about water quality after the recent sewage spill in nearby Ala Wai Canal.This year's course was changed from last year's amid complaints from East Honolulu residents frustrated with the number of sporting events scheduled in the area, including the Honolulu Marathon.The Honolulu Triathlon hosted the 2004 U.S. Olympic triathlon trials, and was the only International Triathlon Union World Cup event in the United States in 2005.  It is one of four such qualifying events in the U.S. this year.Western Australian Paralympic bronze medalist Janet Shaw has died following a long battle with cancer.  She was 46 years old.A vision impaired cyclist, she and pilot Kelly McCombie earned a pair of bronze medals at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in the individual pursuit and road race/time trial events.  She also won four medals at the 2002 IPC Cycling World Championships. Beyond cycling, Shaw worked as a motivational speaker and author, having written two memoirs, Beyond the Red Door and a follow up called Bit of a Super Hero: Choosing the Challenge – My Journey with Cancer.Australian national team coach said of Shaw, "I was privileged to be a National Coach with the Australian Paralympic Team for Athens and have a role with Janet and Kelly leading into those Games. They dedicated themselves so solidly together, and came away medaling in two events.... Janet said losing her eyesight was the best thing that ever happened to her because it eventually led her to where she was standing, waiting to achieve glory in Athens. That quote has stayed with me ever since. She was an amazingly strong person who actually saw more than us."This is the second recent death of an Australian Paralympian. In late November, another Australian Paralympian, Peter Marsh of Queensland, died at the age of 64.  He competed at the 1976 Summer Paralympics, 1980 Summer Paralympics and 1984 Summer Paralympics.  Prior to his death, he was active in a project to document the history of the Paralympic movement in Australia on Wikipedia.Two Australian Paralympic wheelchair basketball players, Shelley Chaplin and Leanne Del Toso, are cycling around Fiji to raise money for people in Fiji with disabilities. They hope to cover the route, which is roughly 500 kilometers (300 miles) long, in just ten days. They started on June 7, 2013 and plan to finish by June 16. Along the way, they intend to do outreach, and mentor people with disabilities. They hope to raise A$13,000. So far, they have raised over A$12,400. They are using crowdfunding to finance their sporting event.Del Toso suffered muscle deterioration in her legs and hands due to a degenerative neurological condition when she was 19, and rides her bike with the aid of orthotics. Chaplin was born a paraplegic, and is using a handcycle.They won silver medals at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London with the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, commonly known as the Gliders.   Both also played for Victoria in Round One of the Australia Women's Wheelchair Basketball League (WNWBL) competition last weekend. Victoria won all four of its games. They expect to be back in action again in Round Two in Perth on June 21–23.Homebush Bay, New South Wales —In a closely fought game Thursday night between the Australian Rollers and the Great Britain men's national wheelchair basketball team at the Sport Centre at the Sydney Olympic Park, Australia rolled away as 65–51 victors.The Australians, many with facial hair, met the partially tattooed Great Britain side with a lot of aggression and sometimes borderline violence on the court.  Wheelchairs rammed into each other with much greater frequency than in the previous match played between the Australian and German women.  Both teams were very vocal on the court and on the bench, loudly telling their teammates what to do or occasionally arguing with the referees.  Bench players on both teams demonstrated a lack of creativity in their sideline chanting, with the Rollers chanting "Defense. Rollers.  Defense."  and the Great Britain side chanting "Defense. Defense."  The Great Britain side, initially very loud from the bench following a 37–33 half time lead, got quieter as the game progressed.  With 6:22 left in the fourth quarter, the game appeared to have gotten away from the referees who answered by calling a technical against Great Britain after one of the Australian players ended up on his back on the court.  The call followed a fan screaming from the stands that the game was not supposed to be a contact sport.  Following the siren to end the game, both sides shook hands.Australia plays their last game in pool play in the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge at 7:30pm Sydney time Friday against Japan while Great Britain meets Japan at 12:00pm Sydney time Friday. All three teams are London bound for the Paralympics next month.Over the weekend, Rowing Australia announced their 2012 national squad in the lead up to the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London.  Australia has earned qualification for ten boats at the Games but have the opportunity to add three additional boats at the Final Olympic Qualification Regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland in late May.One boat attempting to earn qualification at Lucerne is the women's coxed-eight, who had a time at the Sydney Regatta of 2000m time of six minutes 10.03 seconds, about 96% as fast as the predicted time of the gold medal time at the 2012 Summer Olympics.  Selection for a team is considered a major boon for women's rowing as Australia had not been competing internationally in the event after a disappointing performance at the 2008 Games in Beijing, where Australia finished well out of medal range in last, and has yet to live down the "Lay Down Sally" situation at the 2004 Games. Ten rowers, Phoebe Stanley, Hannah Vermeersch, Alexandra Hagan, Sally Kehoe, Tess Gerrand, Renee Chatterton, Emma McCarthy, Sarah Cook, Amy Clay and Robyn Selby-Smith, were named with only eight spots available. The women's coxed-eight team will spend the next three weeks training before cuts will be made for the Qualifiers.The men's lightweight double scull will be competing for Olympic qualification in Switzerland, with Tom Gibson of Tasmania and Rod Chisholm of New South Wales needing a top two finish to make the Games.  Queensland Jared Bidwell in the men's heavyweight single scull is the third boat trying to qualify for London at the Switzerland event, needing a top-three finish to qualify.The men's coxless pair boat also faces competition for which rowers will be going to the Games, with five rowers having been named to fill the two spots.  These rowers include Brodie Buckland, James Marburg, Fergus Pragnell, Duncan Free and Tom Larkins. The 2008 Olympic pairs gold medalist Free's selection comes after a ten-month period where he suffered a rib-cartilage injury and broken leg that resulted in missing selection in the four man scull event. Other rows competing for one of these two spots have impressive resumes: Buckland has previously represented the United States in rowing and Marburg won a silver medal in rowing at the 2008 Games.Toby Lister, who qualified in the men's coxed eight boat as the coxswain, is ready for the Games in more ways than one.  He became the boat leader in 2008, following the retirement of Marty Rabjohns after the Olympics.  He is renowned amongst other rowers for his willingness and ability to play mind games with competitors.Last Thursday, the uniforms for Australia's Olympic team were revealed, including the uniform for rowing.  It has been custom designed by Adidas to mirror muscle movement.A new director was named at the Australian Institute of Sport on Sunday. New director Matthew Favier, who comes from the United Kingdom, has the ability to determine funding for high performance sport, and is scene as a potential positive for rowing as he could increase funding to the sport because it provides multiple Olympic medal potential for one sport.The national team will have a Sydney training camp from May 8 to 12, before departing for Switzerland on May 15th.The Canterbury Bulldogs, a team in Australia's National Rugby League, has entered into an agreement with New South Wales police to provide extra police at all games in NSW. The agreement follows a spate of violent incidents at Bulldogs matches this year.In March, there were fights during and after a game between the Bulldogs and Wests Tigers at Telstra Stadium, the Bulldogs home ground. This led police to step up their presence at Bulldogs matches for the rest of the season. A month later, a group of Bulldogs supporters abused four South Sydney cheerleaders at another home match.According to NSW Police, a meeting was held between the police executive and Bulldogs CEO, Malcolm Noad where it was decided that the club will pay for additional police at all Bulldogs games across NSW. The additional police will include specialist police (including riot police) to provide security for spectators.Only police that are working outside their normal rostered hours will be paid for by the club.The police Commander of the North West Sydney region, Assistant Commissioner said he was pleased that the club was working with the police proactively. “It is pleasing to see the club taking a proactive stance to ensure the games proceed with a strong police presence to provide increased safety” he said.Assistant Commissioner Clifford warned that police would not be specifically targeting Bulldogs supporters, but anyone who is causing trouble at games. “It is hoped this initiative will stamp out violence at future Bulldogs matches.

"This will set a global benchmark — it has been coming to a head for a long time."The inquiry was set up off the back of a feud between sporting organisations and media outlets over the use of footage, some of which was uploaded to YouTube, and photos taken at sporting events. It will also look at whether companies who own broadcast rights can get a commercial return by limiting the use of their footage.Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Australian Associated Press boycotted the Australian cricket season because Cricket Australia required them to sign documents restricting the use of photos and video footage they [AFP, Reuters and AAP] collected.

The issue was resolved."This is a matter that has been of immense concern to the media all over the world and control over access to events is being used to control access to images," said Chris Warren, secretary of the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA).

Wikinews caught up with her between a double header at the Hawker International Softball Centre where Australia women's national softball team played Japan women's national softball team.She was not aware that softball had been played at the Olympics until recently and has no particular desire to play in the Games, though she has ambitions to make the national team.  Which country is a bit of an issue.  Kapea's preference is for Australia but she is half Australian and half New Zealander so she could play for either team and her father would not mind seeing her representing the Kiwis.The Sydney born Kapea plays softball, soccer, and does dance, but she sees softball as her future.  It is the sport she excels the most at, both her parents played the game, and many family friends are involved with the sport.  She started playing the game as a five or six year old, filling in for a youth teeball team coached by a family friend that needed players to fill in the squad.Kapea, the youngest and tallest member of the current ACT Gold side, has represented the ACT and local clubs in competitions that have given her opportunities to travel to Sydney and Melbourne.  She played for ACT at the School Sport Australia National Championship last year in Melbourne.When asked if she faced any discrimination because she is half Maori and softball is traditionally a game for white girls, she said no.  Her teammates were all tremendously supportive and hung out together as a group.  If other softballers on the boys team or elsewhere in ACT softball made any comments, her teammates would correct them.  Kapea said the ACT softball community was like a family.She and other ACT softball players are to be at the Junior International Challenge on Saturday at the Blacktown Inernational Softball Centre.Australian solar racing team Sunswift paraded their fifth car, eVe, on the Kensington campus of the University of New South Wales, Sydney, yesterday.

The driver, as well as the passenger, alighted as six members of the team carried eVe over the stairs of University Mall.eVe, the latest car built by the Sunswift team, was designed for the new Cruiser class of the competition, and thus meets regulations for normal roads-worthy vehicles. While its predecessor IVy weighed under 150 kg, eVe weighs approximately 300 kg, with light carbon fiber monocoque construction and 15 kWh batteries weighing only 63 kg. However, eVe has achieved a similar drag coefficient, despite different overall shape and larger frontal area.The 2013 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge is to take place on October 6–13, 2013.The Independent Sport Panel Report, set up to look into sports funding, was published in Australia last week, prompting debate and speculation for the future of sport in the country. Many in the sector believe the report will prompt changes in the way sport is funded and administered in Australia.File:Colemanflies.jpgJohn Coates, President of the Australian Olympic Committee, criticised the report, and several elite sports people have joined Coates' calls for sustained funding to Olympic level sport. Other commentators have welcomed the recommendations, challenging commonly held beliefs that Australians benefit from funding high performance athletes. Such positions call for more resourcing of sport at a participation level rather than performance level.Key recommendation areas in the report are:Defining Australia's national sports visionReforming the Australian Sports Commission to lead the sports systemMerging Australia's institutes of sportBuilding the capacity of Australia's national sporting organisationsPutting sport and physical activity back into educationBuilding community sport with people and placesEnsuring Australia's sports system is open to allSustaining the funding base for sportAustralians now await a Government response to the recommendations.In the gold medal match at water polo's FINA World League Final tonight between the Australia Stingers and United States women's national water polo team, Australia lost 4–6 to the USA in the last major competition before the 2012 Summer Olympics. The victory made for seven World League Super Final titles for Team USA.At 7:00 p.m. Chinese local time, 9:00 p.m. Australian local time, the game got under way, with a Tweet from Australian Water Polo for fans at home who could not watch the game live. The Australians were down at quarter time, 1–2 with the team's only goal coming from Bronwen Knox off a pass by Kate Gynther.  By half time, Australia had battled back to take the lead 4–3, only to finish the third period tied 4–4 with the United States, and eventually lose 4–6.In the lead up to the World League Final, the Australians spent time in Singapore before departing for China. While in Singapore, players had an opportunity to relax at the pool and several, including Knox, Rowena Webster, Nicola Zagame, and Melissa Rippon were very active on Twitter. The team arrived in Shanghai and the Shanghai Institute of Sport a week before the start of the FINA Super League Finals.  During their week-long preparation, they worked on strength and fitness training.  When away from the pool, they did not have access to Twitter, Facebook, or television and had to entertain themselves using other means.  Players finally explored the city six days after their arrival.With limited opportunities for amusement in the hotel room during the competition, assistant coach Ryan Moar updated his Twitter account and played with a toy helicopter.  Several of the players who were active on Twitter before departing for China stopped updating, including Webster, Rippon, and Zagame. Knox and Moran continued to provide updates on Twitter and Instagram throughout the competition.Australian game days during the tournament included warming up poolside before the start of their games, and cooling down in the pool after them. Going into their match against the USA, they notched an 8–7 victory over China, an 18 to nil victory against Germany, and a 9–7 overtime shootout win against Russia.On gold medal game day, Jane Moran updated her Twitter account to say "Final of World League Super Finals today v USA - goooo Stingers! ‪#stingerspride". About eight hours prior to game time, the team finished their final training session.  Earlier in the afternoon, prior to game time in Australia, Channel 9 ran a feature on the team.  Prior to the start of the game, the Australian Stingers official team Twitter account mocked Team USA for their team-branded k tape. During the pre-game warm up, team members did a variety of things including playing with their phones, warming up, and getting their arms taped.   It was business as usual for the team that had beaten the United States the previous month at the VISA Water Polo International.The bronze medal match between the China women's national water polo team and Greece women's national water polo team preceded the gold medal game, which Greece won 8–7, with quarter scoring of 1–2 in the first, 4–2 in the second, 1–2 in the third, and 1–2 in the fourth.

However, during the session the water in the pool turned, as Bohl described, "cloudy" and "soupy looking". Concerned about his athletes' health, he moved them from the training pool to the busier, but cleaner, main competition pool. Bohl took his concerns to officials and was told the matter would be looked into.This comes off the back of other water concerns in Rio, particularly in the Guanabara Bay venue for outdoor water events. An Associated Press-commissioned study found Rio's Olympic waterways contained as much as 1.7 million times worse viral levels than the emergency threshold in Europe or the US. As a result, athletes were advised to keep their mouths closed and avoid putting their heads underwater or risk falling ill. Swimming events at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games are to begin today.One of Australia's most famous swimming Olympians, Stephanie Rice, 25, announced her retirement earlier today. The swimmer addressed the Australian public in a video. Here she thanked everyone that has supported her and reflected back on her Olympic career, "It's sad, I definitely feel like I'm losing a part of myself, but I'm really excited about what's about to come."After several shoulder operations in the lead up to the 2012 London Olympics, Rice fell short of her own expectations. Disappointed with her performance, she says she wanted to give herself a year or two break before making any decisions about the future. "I felt a lot of pressure to live up to everyone's expectations and fulfil their answers, but I knew I had to take the time for myself to get to the point where I knew 100 percent what I wanted to do," she says.Long-time swimming coach Michael Bohl confirmed Rice's doubts after the London Olympics in a telephone interview with The Associated Press today. "She couldn't get the best out of herself there," he says "but with what she endured, she didn't want to retire with question marks. She wanted a year or two to think about it."While Rice has left her career plans unanswered, she hopes to use her popularity with the Australian public as a platform to something else. "It's safe to say that's the new goal and new passion for me... to prove myself out of the water."Australian top-tier female tennis player, Samantha Stosur, yesterday revealed to the press she has split with long-term coach and mentor David Taylor.The break-up took place after she lost to Simona Halep of Romania in the third round at last week's Cincinnati Masters. "I think we both were kind of feeling that we'd almost come to the end. Unfortunately, it happened to be last week," she declared.Stosur claimed her fourth WTA title in Carlsbad earlier this month, against Belarusian Victoria Azarenka — a former world number 1 and victor of last week's Cincinnati Masters.  "Neither of us, I'm sure, would have wanted it to happen right then, and obviously with winning that tournament almost makes it seem a little bit strange," Stosur acknowledged. In eight days, the US Open — which Stosur won in 2011 — is scheduled to begin at its usual venue in Flushing Meadows, New York. Stosur says she feels confident for the weeks ahead, having already proved capable of ousting Azarenka: "I think now coming into the US Open I'm feeling quite good. Of course it's a new week and you've got to make sure you keep doing everything you need to do to continue on with that success."Australian former tour player Alicia Molik, already with other duties at the Open, has agreeed to fill the role of Taylor. While these arrangements are not permanent, Stosur now has someone to support her on the practice court, and closely watch her matches during the two weeks as per usual. No word yet has been made on who her new coach may be, and she anticipates no change in this until the Open has concluded: "after this tournament I will kind of assess what I want to do, who maybe it can be, and go from there. But there is no one in particular at the moment."Stosur nor Taylor haven't spoken since last week's break-up; however, she says she hopes this does not remain the case. "[W]e spent so much time together and have been through so much, I'm sure we can look past it and be friends", she stated.Stosur's first-round much is set for Tuesday against US newcomer Victoria Duval.Earlier today, the Australian Institute of Sport and Swimming Australia cancelled a team meeting for the Australian Stingers and a Swimming Australia Grand Prix event scheduled for this weekend after two Olympic bound water polo players, Melissa Rippon and Nicola Zagame, were diagnosed with whooping cough.Both players are receiving treatment administered by the Australian Institute of Sport.  Meanwhile, their teammates are in quarantine.  In a statement issued by Water Polo Australia, they said "Water Polo Australia is taking this very seriously and will continue to work closely with AIS health professionals to provide the best care for those players diagnosed and to reduce any potential further risk".For Australia's Olympic bound swimmers, their coaches are expected to arrange alternative training ahead of their leaving for Europe.  In a statement released by Olympic swimming head coach Leigh Nugent, he said, "Originally we'd planned to have this camp as an opportunity to come together for some further relay preparation and the chance for some of the athletes to race and time trial, a month or so out from the Games. From a relay perspective we are confident we're on track with our preparations and will fine-tune things when we get to Manchester in July."Rippon and Zagame are expected to be recovered next week and should be ready for London.London, England — The Australia national wheelchair rugby team defeated Canada 66–51 to win Australia's last gold medal of the 2012 Summer Paralympics.The Canadian team had no answer to Ryley Batt, who scored 37 goals. Ryley out-paced, out-maneuvered, and out-scored his opponents. Before the game he skylarked by riding his wheelchair on one wheel.

At one point two Australian defenders trapped him in a corner, unable to move, which he appeared to find very frustrating. Spectators included the Australian Chef de Mission, Jason Hellwig, and his deputies, Michael Hartung and Kate McLoughlin.

Coach Greg McFadden has been trying to create Olympic-like stress in order to prepare the team for the Games.After the VISA Water Polo International concluded, the Olympic draw was announced, with Australia set to play Italy, Great Britain, and Russia in group play.Bruce, Canberra — Australia's Stingers, the women's national water polo team, completed their five-game test series in Canberra, Australia winning all five matches against Great Britain. The test is part of preparations for the team's 2012 Summer Olympics appearance.With comfortable wins in all five matches, showing an advantage of at least six goals in each game, the test series was the first time Australia's women competed against Great Britain in six years. The series results have implications for the squad composition; of the seventeen players brought into the Australian training camp running this test series, only thirteen of them can expect an opportunity to travel to London to compete in the Olympics.Australia dominated the series with precision passing from the team's goalkeepers who enabled the game to quickly move down the pool, and the ability of the team's goal scorers to get the ball on target. In contrast, through out the series, the UK lacked a quality long passing game and instead relied on short passes from the perimeter of play where they were faced with less one-on-one coverage. The last game of the series also saw several turn overs and poor shooting on the part of the UK, with many shots going above or to the side of the net, or the shot clock running out.Australia won all of the games of the test series, with scores of 13–5 in the first test last Tuesday, 14–4 in the second test last Thursday, 15–6 in the third test on Saturday, 14–8 in the fourth test yesterday (Monday) and 14–3 in the last test match today. In the first match, the scorers for Australia were Ashleigh Southern with four goals, Rowie Webster and Bronwen Knox with three goals each, and Gemma Beadsworth, Melissa Rippon, and Holly Lincoln-Smith each contributing a goal. In the second test match, the scorers for Australia were Hannah Buckling and Rippon with three goals, Knox and Beadsworth with two goals each, and Kate Gynther, Zoe Arancini, and Glencora Ralph each contributing a goal. For the third test, Australia's goal scorers were Jane Moran, Webster, and Nicola Zagame with three goals each, Lincoln-Smith with two goals, and Beadsworth, Buckling, Rippon, and Sophie Smith with one goal apiece. In Australia's fourth test match, Gynther and Zagame scored three each, Southern and Ralph scored two goals apiece, and Webster, Smith, Lincoln-Smith, and Moran each scored a goal. In the last game, Southern and Ralph scored three goals, Webster and Zagame had two goals each, and Beadsworth, Lincoln-Smith, Knox, and Buckling each scored a goal.London, England — By yesterday, with only a few days left before the start of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the Australian team had made themselves at home inside the Paralympic Village with uniquely Australian symbols including the emu and kangaroo. Beyond the Australians, other nations were busy in the village including people from Turkey, Russia, and the Ukraine.The Paralympic Village was open to the press corps yesterday in one last opportunity for journalists to view it without being rights holders or being accompanied by National Paralympic Committee personnel.Major media outlets have told an Australian senate committee on environment, communications and the arts that Australians are being denied full coverage of sporting events.They have told the inquiry that major sporting organisations are restricting how photos and text can be used on the internet and other digital media, which is threatening the reporting of sport as news.Sporting organisations have hit back saying that such online content is a big money earner for them. They say that the money earned from those rights gets invested in grassroots programs.Australian Associated Press asked the committee to recommend legislation guaranteeing the right of news media cover major sporting events."AAP reporting and photography are the lifeblood of news for regional and rural newspapers across the country," Fairfax Media, publisher of The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and a number of regional papers, said in its submission. "Millions of Australians are being prevented from receiving full AAP coverage of major sporting events. When photographs of sport events are privatised, all forms of journalism are vulnerable to such restrictions.""AAP believes that the most effective way to protect the public interest in receiving news about sporting and related events is to have a legislated provision for right of access for news media," AAP's submission says.The Australian Football League, in its submission, also argued for legislative amendments, but to the Copyright Act. Their recommendations would see the use of audio-visual, photographic and audio media restricted in the digital domain."To avoid protracted disputes with media organisations and to ensure a minimum standard of protection across digital sports news reporting in Australia, AFL believes that the best means of introducing these restrictions is by way of amendments to the Copyright Act or a mandatory industry code," the AFL's submission said.Wikinews asked the AFL, Football Federation Australia and the Sunshine Coast Daily for comment. The AFL refused to comment until after their submission was formally made to the committee.Following the second full day of competition at the IPC Alpine World Championships in La Molina, Spain yesterday, Austria led the medal race with three gold medals, a silver, and a bronze.

The avalanche started at 10:30 AM, starting about 12 miles off Interstate 70, and taking three different paths down the mountain before coming to a stop."Our crews said it was the largest they have ever seen. It took three paths," said a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, Stacey Stegman.All eight (7 adults, 1 minor) have been taken to the St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver. According to a hospital spokeswoman, all of the victims suffered minor injuries. Seven patients were  released on Saturday. There were no casualties.U.S. route 40 is currently closed to traffic. According to Winter Park spokesman Matt Sugar, there are no plans to close the ski hills. "We've gotten calls from all over the country asking if the resort is closed," he said, "and the answer is no."This is the third snow storm to hit the Denver area in three weeks.A week after Sunni and Shi'ite youth protesters marched on the capital city of Manama, the Bahrain government informed Formula One Management that it would withdraw from hosting the Bahrain Grand Prix. The decision was made in an effort to focus on the pressing national issues facing the country. Demonstrators, who are still holding Pearl Square, had threatened to target the Media attention if the event went ahead as scheduled. The race is the opening event of the 2011 Formula One racing season.Bahrain's Crown Prince, HRH Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, sent a statement to Formula One Management which said, "At the present time the country’s entire attention is focused on building a new national dialogue for Bahrain. After the events of the past week, our nation’s priority is on overcoming tragedy, healing divisions and rediscovering the fabric that draws this country together; reminding the world of the very best that Bahrain is capable of as a nation once again united."The Bahrain Grand Prix was to be held on March 13, with teams coming in within the next few weeks to prepare for the race. Formula One president and CEO Bernie Ecclestone issued a public statement saying, "It is sad that Bahrain has had to withdraw from the race, we wish the whole nation well as they begin to heal their country." Ecclestone also noted that despite reported rumors, the Bahrain International Circuit would not be charged for their cancellation of the event, citing that he considered the political unrest to be a "force majeure" and that the events that took place could not have been predicted. "What has happened in Bahrain is desperately sad but one month ago everyone was looking forward to the race," he said. Formula One Management will most likely have to absorb the costs related to the canceled race, estimated at around $40 million, unless it can be re-scheduled later in the season.With the announcement from the Crown Prince that political issues would be addressed, exiled Shi'ite political leader Hassan Mushaima announced that he would return to the country. Mushaima, leader of the Haq Movement opposition party, was tried in absentia in 2009, accused of attempting to overthrow the government. Other Haq Movement members have also been arrested in recent years, but received royal pardons. While 23 members of the political movement are currently awaiting trial, on Tuesday the Bahrain government released a group of political detainees without comment, meeting one of the demands of the protesters.Yesterday, Spanish capital football club Real Madrid announced Welsh winger Gareth Bale has signed a contract extension which runs through June 2022.Bale joined Los Blancos in the summer of 2013 from London-based club Tottenham Hotspur for £85 million (about €100 million), a world-record fee at the time, and since then he has scored 62 goals in 135 matches for the club, of which he scored 50 goals in the Spanish La Liga. Spending three seasons at Real Madrid, Gareth Bale has won two UEFA Champions League trophies.According to varying reports noted by Fox Sports, 27-year-old Bale would earn weekly about £350,000 after tax, making him the third highest paid footballer after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.After the contract extension, Bale said, "When you have the opportunity to play here [Real Madrid] you cannot waste it".Previously, Real Madrid announced contact extension of German midfielder Toni Kroos, Croatian midfielder Luka Modrić, and Spanish forward Lucas Vázquez. Real Madrid is banned by FIFA from signing new players till 2018, due to signing under-age players.On February 13, Baltimore Ravens cornerback Deion Sanders announced his re-retirement from the NFL. Last January, many assumed Sanders would be leaving the league after spending 14 years in it. Sanders won back-to-back Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys. Sanders is the first professional athlete to win a World Series and Super Bowl in his pro career. The All-Pro Cornerback had 53 interceptions, was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and was once Defensive Player of the Year. Reports speculate Sanders, who broadcast with CBS after his first retirement, may go back into news broadcasting, possibly on the [w:Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] NFL Pre-Game Show. After his retirement, current Ravens Cornerback Chris McAlister stated, "I'll miss Deion, just as the rest of the Ravens organization will. I learned a lot from him."Spanish giants Barcelona bowed out of the Champions League earlier today, even after defeating Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield.  Barcelona was up against the wall from the get-go after losing 2-1 in the first leg of the series.  Due to the away goals rule (in the event of a tie after both games, the side to score more away goals advances), Barcelona required at at least two goals to advance.  Liverpool have been strong at home this season, losing only one domestic league match this season at Anfield to rivals Manchester United.  Liverpool featured one of their recent January signings in the match by the way of Alvaro Arbeloa, while Barcelona played their usual lineup including Ronaldinho and Deco.Though Barca was the desperate team in the match, Liverpool were the more dominant side after the kickoff, as they used the support of their home crowd to boost them.  After only 5 minutes, Steve Finnan crossed in a well placed ball to Bellamy, but the Welshman wasn't able to head the ball into the open net.  Riise, who scored the winning goal in the first leg, continued to threaten Barcelona with two of his trademark long-range shots.  The first flew just wide, and the second was even closer as it hit off the crossbar.  Another attack by Liverpool made Barcelona look shaky as Victor Valdes was force into a double save, first off Bellamy, then off Dirk Kuyt.  He could get nowhere near a diving header by Riise on the same play, but defender Puyol was able to clear the ball off the line to keep Barcelonas hopes alive.  Liverpool would hit the bar again several minutes later, after a poor clearing attempt by Valdes was handed straight to Sissoko, and he was unfortunate to see his first time shot bang off the bar and go safely over the net. In the whole of the first half, Barcelona were not able to stretch Liverpools keeper Jose Reina, as the Reds defence snuffed out all of Barca's offensive talent.The second half started much as the first did, with Liverpool having a scoring chance within the minute.  Captain Steven Gerrard made a run down the right side and crossed the ball into Kuyt, but the Dutchman missed the ball, and Bellamy wasn't expecting the ball to come to him as it flew safely through the area.  Jose Reina was finally forced into a save on 50 minutes, but Ronaldinho's long range shot was easy pickings for the Spaniard.  Ronaldinho would have another great chance minutes later as he made a quick run, exchange passes with Deco, and twisted past Jamie Carragher, only to see his side footed shot slam off the post.  Barcelona continued to push, and a good save by Reina was required to keep youngster Lionel Messi from scoring.  Barcelona's coach Frank Rikjarrd decided it was time for some changes and sent Giuly and Gudjohnsen into the mix.  Gudjohnsen was used to playing against Liverpool after his years at Chelsea, and seemed to use it to his advantage as he received a pass from Xavi and slotted the ball home to give Barcelona sight of the next round.  Ronaldinho then forced a save out of Reina, and Barcelona appeared to have regained their passing game, which caused the home fans to worry.  Liverpool still played strongly, and Steven Gerrard was the main point of their inspiration winning a free kick, which was wasted, and then seeing a left footed effort palmed away by Victor Valdes.  Liverpool had a chance to equalise in the final minutes, but were not able to convert.  The one goal would not be enough for Barcelona however, as Liverpool advances to the next round of the Champions League.Claiming their major trophy of the season, FC Barcelona dominated reigning champions Manchester United F.C. at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome Wednesday to win the 2009 Champions League Final 2 – 0.After a shaky start, Samuel Eto'o shot the ball past Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in the tenth minute, the only goal Barcelona would need.Manchester had several great chances in the opening ten minutes, with Christiano Ronaldo forcing a save from Barca keeper Víctor Valdés in the second minute. However it was Eto'o who capitalized on his teams first real chance striking a low ball that van der Sar could get hands to.After the goal, Barcelona settled into a smooth passing game dominating long stretches in the remainder of the first half.At the start of the second half, United looked to be on the offensive substituting Argentinian Carlos Tévez for the Brazilian Anderson and the Red Devils looked to have gained a boost for the first ten minutes of the half, but again Barcelona settled into a passing rhythm United could not break. In the 53rd minute, Xavi Hernández's free kick hit the crossbar, which proved to be Barca's best chance early in the half.Halfway into the second half, Dimitar Berbatov came on for Ji-Sung Park, but Berbatov proved no better and in the 70th minute Lionel Messi headed in a cross from Hernández, giving Barca an insurance goal. Four minutes later, Barca captain Carles Puyol has a great chance on goal, but van der Saar in the United goal is equal to the task. In the next minute, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, makes his third and final change, subbing in Paul Scholes for Ryan Giggs.Scholes scored the lone goal in last season's semi-final to put United into the final, but could not do so and as the minutes ticked off, United got increasingly desperate, earning three yellow cards in the final 12 minutes, but could not score and Barcelona took their second Champions League title since the 2005–06.Barcelona also earned two domestic trophies, earning both the La Liga and the Copa del Rey titles.Manchester United also earned three major trophies, earning the Premier League title, the League Cup title and the Community shield. In addition United defeated the best international club teams in 2008 Club World Cup.Both teams will be eligible for the Champions League 2009–10, with Barcelona as title holders and winners of La Liga and Manchester United as the winners of the Premier League.Other domestic club champions qualifying for the group state of next season's competition include Italy's Internazionale, France's Bordeaux, Germany's Wolfsburg, Russia's Rubin Kazan, Portugal's Porto, the Netherlands' Alkmaar Zaanstreek, Scotland's Rangers, the Ukraine's Dynamo Kyiv, and Belgium's Standard Liège. Champions of Romania and Turkey have yet to be determined and will join the group stage.FC Barcelona defender Éric Abidal will be taken into surgery for a liver transplant in the next few weeks, his club announced yesterday.The France international football player, 32, had previously undertaken surgery to remove a tumour from his liver in March 2011. He recovered from the initial operation in time to win the UEFA Champions League with his club in May. In a statement, FC Barcelona cited ongoing medical concerns as reason for the player's admission. "Given the development of his medical condition, Abidal will undergo a liver transplant in the following weeks", the statement read. It added: "The transplant is an option that has been considered since the beginning of his treatment, one year ago. At the express wish of the player, the club request the utmost respect for the right to privacy."His club did not estimate how long he will be out of action, and there is serious doubt as to whether or not Abidal will be fit in time to make the French side for the Euro 2012 Championships, set to be held between June and July in Poland and Ukraine. Teammates posted messages at social networking site Twitter to convey their goodwill for the defender. Forward David Villa, who is currently out of action with a broken leg, said, "All my strength for Abidal! You will get through it. You are very strong. We will all be by your side." "You will return and you will do it like always, being the best", wrote central defender Gerard Pique. "You are an example for everyone."Abidal signed with Barcelona in 2007, leaving his old club Lyon. So far this season he has made 20 first-team appearances for the Spanish side; he has not played since injuring his hip in an international friendly against Germany earlier this month.After his recovery from his surgery in 2011, he said he "thought that [he] wouldn't play again", and told of how he sold all the cars he owned, donating the money to "the fight against illnesses with some associations that I have had contact with".Barcelona defeated Arsenal to win the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1992. They had to come from a goal down to triumph against ten-man Arsenal. Jens Lehmann became the first player to be sent off in a final through bringing down Samuel Eto'o. Sol Campbell headed Arsenal into the lead from a Thierry Henry freekick, Samuel Eto'o equalized and later Juliano Belletti scored the decisive winner for Barcelona.Barry Bonds, a United States baseball player, has been found guilty of one count of obstructing justice for giving an evasive answer  to a federal grand jury under oath  when asked whether he had ever received drugs necessitating a syringe.   The judge declared a mistrial  on three other  obstruction of justice counts, the three charges that Bonds made false statements when he said to a grand jury in December 2003 that he never knowingly used steroids or human growth hormones given to him by  his personal trainer, and that he permitted only doctors to give him injections. The charge that Bonds was convicted of does not mention steroids.The conviction comes after a seven year prosecution of  Bonds, stemming from the investigation of  Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BELCO) begun in 2002. Bonds appeared in an advertisement for BELCO which was reportedly selling designer steroids and other drug paraphernalia to professional athletes. Thirty athletes were called to answer questions before the grand jury.  Bonds had been given immunity for his testimony."This case is about upholding one of the most fundamental principles in our system of justice—the obligation of every witness to provide truthful and direct testimony in judicial proceedings," said federal  prosecutor Melinda Haag.  "In the United States, taking an oath and promising to testify truthfully is a serious matter. We cannot ignore those who choose instead to obstruct justice. We will decide whether to seek a retrial of the defendant on the remaining counts as soon as possible."Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants has officially tied Hank Aaron's decades old home run record. Bonds hit the home run at PETCO Park in an away game against the San Diego Padres Saturday night. Pitcher Clay Hensley gave up the homer in the second inning, a 382 foot homer over the left-center field wall. Adam Hughes, a 33-year old plumber caught the ball, which is worth millions of dollars on the collectibles market. Security guards quickly escorted the plumber and the ball from the stands.In post game interviews, Barry said, "The hard part is over," referring to the long try to tie the record. Aaron did not issue a statement.Bonds did not comment yesterday on the steroids scandal that has tainted his last several years in baseball. Currently, Bonds is under investigation for perjury by a federal grand jury regarding his 2003 testimony on the BALCO steroids case, in which he denied using performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds allegedly used steroids, which were not prohibited by Major League Baseball at the time, though they could not be obtained without a prescription.Bonds is not only first in career home runs but also is first in career walks and intentional walks. Bonds also holds the single-season home run record with 73 home runs in 2001.Bonds, a sure fire Hall of Famer, is one of the oldest players in the majors. He turned 43 on July 24. So far, Bonds has hit 21 home runs this season.Barry Prime has been appointed the new National Performance Director of Swim Ireland, the governing body of swimming in Ireland.Mr. Prime (50), a former British Olympian, has an extensive coaching background. He moved to Australia in 1993 to take on the role of senior coach at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in Canberra. He spent 25 years coaching in Birmingham prior to his move to Australia. In Birmingham he trained five British swimmers to Olympic representation including Nick Gillingham.Swim Ireland has struggled in recent years due to a sex abuse scandal and legal dispute with Sarah Keane who was made CEO last year. Further setbacks occurred earlier this year when the National Aquatics Center (NAC) in Dublin suffered storm damage to its roof resulting in closure since then.Having announced that Barry Prime would take over the newly created post of National Performance Director for swimming, Swim Ireland has revealed that the British coach has changed his mind about taking up the post. Speaking from his home Mr. Prime told journalists "It is with regret that I had to inform the Swim Ireland Board of my decision not to take up the position of National Performance Director." Barry Prime had agreed earlier this month to take over the post, but has changed his mind because he does not wish to move to Ireland from his current home in Australia. He said, "I have realized that I do not wish to leave Australia and for that reason, and that reason alone, I will not take up the post."The loss of Mr. Prime, a seasoned professional coach at the Australian Institute of Sport, is a major blow to Swim Ireland which has struggled in recent years to adapt to changes in international swimming.Today, Catalonia-based football club FC Barcelona defeated Argentine club River Plate FC 3–0 at Nissan Stadium in Yokohama in the FIFA Club World Cup final hosted in Japan.FIFA Club World Cup is a tournament in which football clubs winning in the respective continental confederation championships participate.

No cause of death was yet formally determined, although some observers speculated he sustained an aneurysm or heart failure.Since leaving the Oakland Athletics, Kennedy signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks briefly during August 2007 then being released the same month. Kennedy then joined the  Toronto Blue Jays late that month.The 6-foot, 4-inch southpaw pitched at Grossmont Junior College in El Cajon, California before being drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 8th round of the 1998 amateur draft.  Kennedy pitched a total of 908.7 innings with a winning percentage of .413 and a 4.5 ERA for his career.Champion Tampa Bay Rays baseball player Manny Ramirez, 38, notified the MLB on Friday that he would retire   after being notified that he had  tested positive for a banned perforance-enhancing drug. It was his second offense and he was facing a 100-game suspension. In 2009  as a Los Angeles Dodger, he served a 50-game suspension for violating the MLB's drug policy.Ending a 19-year career, the twelve-time All-Star player who is considered one of the baseball's greatest hitters, won two World Series championships with the Boston Red Sox.He batted a career average of .312, and for 13 seasons he produced more than 200 RBIs. He  hit a career total of 555 home runs and 1,831 RBIs, exceeding the number of home runs and RBIs of Mickey Mantle. He ranks number 14 on the all time list. Now there may be an asterisk after his record numbers."His numbers, he was unreal," said Red Sox infielder Omar Vizquel, who was Ramirez's teammate with the Cleveland Indians. "He was one of the most feared guys with runners in scoring position. ... If there is a guy you really want at the plate in a tough situation, it would have been Manny."Ramirez's retirement coincides with the trial of another of baseball's great hitters, Barry Bonds, charged with  falsely denying to a grand jury that he used performance-enhancing drugs. "Until the past couple of years, I thought [Ramirez] was on his way to the Hall of Fame," said Texas Rangers manager Ron Washington. "I don't think many guys got as many big hits in their careers as he has. There weren't many guys who had as big an effect on a game as he had. You hate to see greatness all of a sudden just fade."Baseball home-run leader Barry Bonds was indicted today in the United States District Court in San Francisco, California. The charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stem from Bonds's testimony that he did not knowingly take steroids to a grand jury during the BALCO scandal. Evidence was allegedly obtained during the investigation that included a positive test for performance-enhancing substances. Bonds, currently a free agent, still denies using steroids.The indictment said: "During the criminal investigation, evidence was obtained including positive tests for the presence of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing substances for Bonds and other professional athletes."If Bonds is convicted of all four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice, he could face up to 20 to 30 years in prison.It just wasn't their day for the two baseball teams on either side of the Straight, as China Stars and Uni-President Lions were both eliminated in a route at the Konami Cup 2007. The final of Konami Cup will take place between SK Wyverns and Chunichi Dragons.If the same fixture can be played in different countries same day, today in 2007 BWC and Konami Cup 2007 was the best example of this. Two professional teams battled in Tokyo, but two national teams battled in Taichung.At the Konami Cup, SK Wyverns easily won by ending early the games against China Stars with 13-0 by SK's aggressive hitting firstly, but in the "Uni-President Lions vs Chunichi Dragons", they battled with a pitching game.The key factors of errors decided the winner in this game.

Rose accepted the lifetime ban in exchange for not returning a finding of fact that Rose did indeed bet on baseball. He initially indicated to MLB commissioner Bud Selig and in his book My Prison Without Bars that he did bet on Major League Baseball games, but that he never bet against his team or used his betting to influence the outcome of any game. The Dowd report concurs with this statement from Rose.Rose acknowledged his betting in the hopes that Selig would reinstate Rose and thus make him eligible for a number of accolades of which, to this point, he had been deprived. However, Selig refused to reinstate him despite his confession. Among those accolades include a formal retirement of his uniform number 14 and induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. While his number cannot formally be retired, no player since Rose's retirement has worn the number, and it is unlikely that it will be worn again by any player on the Cincinnati Reds.Rose appeared on the Dan Patrick Show on ESPN Radio as part of promotion for an exhibit at the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati detailing the baseball career of Rose. He said that "I bet on my team to win every night because I love my team, I believe in my team. I did everything in my power every night to win that game."The International Olympic Committee has announced today that baseball and softball are to be cut from Olympic competition from 2012.

He was 37 years old. His death was confirmed by the Los Angeles Dodgers organization and his family.Lima, who had not experienced any prior health problems that led to the heart attack, was reportedly experiencing "nightmares" the evening before he died, according to his wife Dorca Astacio. These "nightmares" eventually led to Astacio calling local paramedics for help, but Lima was declared dead upon their arrival at the couple's home this morning.Lima was born on September 30, 1972 in Santiago, Dominican Republic. He began his major league career with the Detroit Tigers at age 22 during the 1994 season. He played with the Tigers for two more years until he was traded to the Houston Astros. Lima statistically played his best seasons with the Astros, including a 21-10 record in the 1999 season. While playing for Houston, fans coined the phrase (and chant) "Lima Time" when he was starting at pitcher.Lima's stats declined after he was traded back to the Tigers in 2001. He played his remaining five seasons with the New York Mets, Kansas City Royals, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Lima finished his Major League career with 89 wins, 102 losses, and 980 strikeouts when he retired from the MLB in 2006. Lima continued to play baseball for teams in Korea and the Dominican Republic until 2009. He had also stated in recent interviews that he would come back to pitching in the MLB if offered."I'm in shock [...] He was a very happy man. A lot of people loved him. And he was a great pitcher, a competitor. I had so much fun when he threw. He enjoyed the game. I was a fan of his," said José Cruz, a former teammate of Lima's and a former first base coach for the Astros. "He was a good man; he was a good friend," added Cruz.The Washington Nationals completed a trade late Wednesday night that sent outfielders Brad Wilkerson and Terrmel Sledge and minor league pitcher Armando Galarraga to the Texas Rangers for All-Star second baseman Alfonso Soriano.Soriano batted .268 with 36 homers, 104 RBIs and 30 stolen bases last season while earning $7.5 million. He is a career .280 hitter, with a .320 on-base percentage and an OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage) of .820. Soriano turns 30 in January and his contract ends after the 2006 season.For the Nationals, Wilkerson batted .248 last year with 11 homeruns and 57 RBIs, but was sidelined for part of the season with a forearm injury. For his career, he is a .256 hitter with a .365 on-base percentage and an .817 OPS. He made just over $3 million in 2005, and he turns 29 in June of 2006.Sledge only played 20 games in 2005 because he tore his hamstring, but he is most well-known in Washington for hitting the first homerun in Nationals history.ESPN is reporting that the Nationals may play Soriano in the outfield because they already have Jose Vidro, a career .300 hitter, at second base. Vidro missed almost half of the 2005 season with leg problems.Dallas Braden, a left-handed pitcher for Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics in the United States, became one of only nineteen players in the history of the MLB to pitch a perfect game, in a 4-0 win against the Tampa Bay Rays. Braden, aged 26, who retired all 27 batters consecutively on 109 pitches, also earned his first career complete game. In the process of throwing the perfect game, Braden also struck out six Tampa Bay hitters.The perfect game was the second pitched in the Athletics' franchise history, the other being thrown by Hall of Fame pitcher Catfish Hunter on May 8, 1968 against the Minnesota Twins. Braden, at 26, also became the youngest pitcher to throw a complete game since Anaheim Angels pitcher Mike Witt did so at age 24 in 1984.The low crowd at the Oakland Coliseum, at only 12,228, was due to the Mother's Day holiday occurring across the United States, Braden, along with every other Major League Baseball player, donned pink equipment for awareness of breast cancer, which has become a tradition for baseball players on Mother's Day. Braden's own mother died of skin cancer when he was a senior in high school, but his grandmother attended the game.Braden recently drew controversy in the league after publicly criticizing New York Yankees all-star third baseman Alex Rodriguez for crossing the pitcher's mound after a foul ball, which Braden claimed to be an "unwritten rule" in baseball. When asked about the no hitter, Rodriguez simply responded, "Good for him, he threw a perfect game. And even better, he beat the Rays," he said, as the Rays lead the American League East division, the same division that Yankees play in."Mother's Day hasn't been a joyous day for me in a while. But to know that I still get to come out and compete and play a game on that day, that makes it a little better. With my grandma in the stands, that makes it a lot better. To be able to give her this today was perfect...," said Braden in a post-game interview with MLB.com.Yesterday, the Oakland Athletics defeated the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 10 to 4 at an Angels' home game.All of the A's starting line up got at least one hit.

Barton tripped on grass attempting to catch Matsui's hit ball. Manager Bob Geren remarked, "Someone in the dugout said, 'He twisted his knee,' and when I ran out there, I could hear fans watching the replay and giving that real ugly 'Ooo.' Right then, I knew it must have looked ugly. But he said he was fine."Mark Saxon, an ESPN sports writer, reports if the Angels lose today's game, they will be in for their worst season start since 1961, the team's first year. The A's are at a four wins, one loss, only losing their first game, whereas the Angels have a four game losing streak.Yesterday, Basketball Australia announced the final Olympic squads for the 2012 Summer Olympics ahead of a farewell series in the Melbourne area this weekend for both the Opals women's team and the Boomers men's team.Lauren Jackson, Kristi Harrower, Belinda Snell, Jennifer Screen, Samantha Richards, Rachel Jarry, Kathleen Macleod, Elizabeth Cambage, Jenna O’Hea, Abby Bishop, Suzy Batkovic, and Laura Hodges earned a trip to London as members of the Opals 2012 Summer Olympics team.On the men's side, Patrick Mills, Matt Dellavedova, Joe Ingles, Adam Gibson, Peter Crawford, Brad Newley, David Barlow, David Andersen, Matt Nielsen, Mark Worthington, Aleks Maric, and Aron Baynes earned a trip to London.The Opals kick off their Olympic campaign on the first day of the Olympics in a match against Great Britain.

"They were more aggressive. They attacked us the entire night. I didn't think we handled it very well."While both teams have displayed consistent defensive showing, Boston could not match L.A.'s output."You can't ease into the game, especially in the finals," Pierce said, according to the Associated Press. "That's one of the better rebounding teams in the NBA. We've just got to do a better job rebounding the ball, eliminating easy opportunities. When I look up and we've given up 100 points, I haven't seen that in a while."The first quarter was fairly evenly matched, ending 26–21 in favor of the Lakers. At one point the Lakers were up 16–10, but Boston was able to close to within one point.

In the final six minutes, Boston outscored the Lakers 13–11, but it was not enough to bring the game back to single digits.Both Pierce and Ray Allen fouled-out for the Celtics. Odam fouled-out for Los Angeles.This series is the 12th between the two franchises, dating back to 1959, with the Celtics leading the series 9–2.

Er hat mit seinem Fachwissen, seiner Professionalität und seinem Netzwerk einen wichtigen Beitrag zum Erfolg des FC Bayern geleistet. Ich wünsche ihm alles Gute für seine Zukunft.On Friday, Reschke requested termination of his contract with the German giants, which was valid for another year, until June 30, 2018.Comments made about Olympics swimmer Rebecca Adlington on British television programme Mock the Week "breached guidelines", the BBC Trust has said. Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle, at the time a panelist on the satirical gameshow, made the comments about the swimmer.  The episode the comments featured on was originally broadcast in August 2008 on BBC Two.  The episode caused a total of 75 complaints to be made to the BBC.  The producer then apologised four months later, saying, "[t]he ribbing may have gone a tad too far on this occasion."Now the BBC Trust has said that the comments "breached guidelines".  They commented that the jokes "risked offending the audience" and were "humiliating".  Speaking about the comments, BBC Trustee Richard Tait made a statement saying: "For Mock the Week, the [Trust's Editorial Standards] committee felt that the comments about Rebecca were humiliating, and this was exacerbated by the fact that she had not sought celebrity status or courted media attention.  There was no clear editorial purpose for the joke's inclusion."Boyle's specific comments were quoted in The Daily Telegraph and were as follows: "The thing that nobody really said about Rebecca Adlington is that she looks pretty weird. She looks like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a spoon...When she arrived back on the flight [from Beijing] she met her boyfriend. Did you see her boyfriend? He was really attractive. He was like a male model. So from that I have deduced that Rebecca Adlington is very dirty." This information came through seventeen days after the BBC announced that Frankie Boyle would be leaving the panel of the show after being a regular panellist since the show started in June 2005 due to "other television commitments". The show had been running for seven series, and will continue to run for another two seasons, despite his absence. A spokesperson for Mock the Week had said that he had been "a brilliant member of the team" and that "the door is always open for him to come back".Wikinews recently spoke with Mark Busse, president of the BC Chapter of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada, to find out what his organization's views are of the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic mascots, Miga, Quatchi, and Sumi.While the products at HBC stores of the mascots have been flying off the shelves, many have bashed the designs for having "too much" of a Japanese influence. As of 2001, 1.5% of Vancouverites were Japanese heritage, and 29.9% were of Chinese descent. Vancouver's Chinatown is one of the largest historic Chinatowns in North America, and Japan has had diplomatic relations with the city since 1930.This is the first time the Olympic and Paralympic mascots have been unveiled at the same time.Busse is also a partner and the design director at Industrial Brand Creative, a design firm in the province. He is co-chair of Graphex '08, a design exhibition at the Emily Carr Institute, which "showcases the best cultural, social and business communications in Canada."David Beckham of the Los Angeles Galaxy will miss his scheduled Major League Soccer debut tomorrow when the Galaxy will face Toronto FC.Beckham signed a five year contract with the Galaxy in January 2007, but due to injuries, was only able to play for 12 minutes so far in a friendly match against the English team Chelsea. On June 6, he sprained his left ankle in England's game against Estonia.

In the specially commissioned shots, Beckham is shown in battle with a fire-breathing dragon.The pictures were taken by America's foremost celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, in the former England captain's current home of Spain, where he plays for football club Real Madrid.Beckham described the experience as unique, saying: "I am the Prince and I am sort of slaying a dragon which is something I've never done before, obviously, and it's a very exciting project."When I was called about it and asked to do it, I was very honoured and really looking forward to it especially with Annie doing the pictures. I think that she always takes great pictures of everybody and she's always taken great pictures of me."The portrait was taken months before Beckham signed his multi-million deal with football club LA Galaxy. It is part of an advertising campaign that will be seen across America. The publicity has added further frenzy to Beckham's high-profile arrival to the country, which is already being compared to that of the Beatles.Leibovitz believes the 31-year-old footballer will grace Hollywood with more than just sporting skills."I think he would like to act and it was sort of a stepping-stone to that and I think he would actually make a great actor. He took it very seriously and when he wielded the sword on the horse, he really was very very serious about it and I love that."Although it is not clear what else may be in the Hollywood pipeline for David and Victoria Beckham, Los Angeles and the United States seem to have already embraced the celebrity pair. Waxworks of the couple have been unveiled at Madame Tussaud's in New York, the Beckham's have launched their own perfume and they recently acquired newly-wed Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes as very close friends.The 2008 Summer Olympics were formally declared closed during a colourful ceremony at the iconic Beijing National Stadium with the Olympics flag being handed over to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson.

"And now, in accordance with tradition, I declare the Games of the XXIX Olympiad closed, and I call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in London to celebrate the Games of the XXX Olympiad."The Beijing Olympics lasted 16 days at the Olympic Village during which athletes from 204 countries participated in 38 contests for 302 gold medals. Host China maintained its supremacy on the medals table right from the beginning to the end of the Games.The next Summer Olympic Games will be held in London in 2012.American swimmer Michael Phelps, 23, has set a new record for the most gold medals won in one Olympic games by winning his eighth gold medal of the 2008 Olympic games, beating the previous world record of seven that was set by Mark Spitz in the 1972 Olympic Games, which took place in Munich, Germany.Phelps' eighth medal was won in the final of the men's 4 x 100m medley relay.

"I was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit. For the three Olympics I've been a part of, this is by far the closest men's team that we've ever had.

Grant Hackett, an Australian swimmer, praised Phelps for achieving his goal. "Michael Phelps - you can't put it in words what he has done here, his level of achievement is phenomenal and I don't think it will ever be seen again."This morning European time, the Belgium men's national goalball team departed for Espoo, Finland for the 2014 IBSA Goalball World Championships.    The championship is the biggest competition since the 2012 Summer Paralympics.The team is scheduled to play their opening game on the morning of June 30 against Brazil men's national goalball team.  They are scheduled to play their second game of pool play against Turkey men's national goalball team later that afternoon.  Their remaining games in pool play are against Canada, Lithuania, Egypt, China and Japan. The members of the team are Bruno Vanhove, Tom Vanhove, Klison Mapreni, Youssef Bihi, Wassime Amnir and Glenn Van Thournout.  They are coached by Jean Claude Meulemans and Werner Van Thournout. 30-year-old teammates Bruno and  Tom Vanhove are sextuplet brothers, who have been part of the national goalball program for about ten years.

They lost to Algeria 7–11, defeated Russia 11–5, lost to the United States 3–13, defeated the Netherlands 10–5, narrowly lost to Finland 5–6, and lost to Lithuania 6–13. Goalball was created in 1946, exclusively for people with a visual disability and designed to help with the rehabilitation of veterans returning from World War II. Play in the Paralympics consists of two twelve-minute periods, with a three minute break between halves. Players are blindfolded to ensure all are equally visually handicapped on-court, and the game can be stopped to ensure goggles are properly fitted. Standing in front of a long goal, they throw the ball at the opposition team's net who in turn try to block it by listening to the ball, which contains a bell, and using their bodies to prevent the ball from going in. The audience is asked to remain silent during play.Yesterday, the 2007 edition of the Zwintriathlon took place. This short course Triathlon starts in the canal in Sluis, the Netherlands, where the athletes swim 1000 metres. Then the 41 kilometres cycling part of the race goes through the nature domain Het Zwin, to the city of Knokke in Belgium, where the athletes had 10 kilometres of running on the seawall ahead of them. The finish was at the casino in Knokke.In the Men's race, Stijn Goris surprisingly beat living legend Luc Van Lierde and Rutger Beke, known for being acquitted from allegations that he had used EPO. Goris, the leader in the overall ranking in the Olympic distance, could just follow Luc Van Lierde during the swimming part. He completed the cycling race together with Van Lierde, but had better legs during the footrace. Number four was Bart Aernouts, a duathlete champion who increasingly focuses on triathlon. Young talents Marc Geerts and Lander Dirken followed, before Frederik Van Lierde and Koen Hoeyberghs, who won the competition in the age group of 40 years and older (40+).Kristien Vleugels was the first female athlete, before Knokke's local favourite and category 40+ athlete Françoise Wellekens. Another favourite, Joke Coysman, stopped her race after fainting during the running section. Sofie Goos followed, while Marjolein Truyers managed to keep her advantage before Inge Vancauwenberghe and Anne-Marie Dupont. The winners from each race took home €2500.Almost 1000 athletes came to Knokke for the triathlon, professional and recreational, men and woman, and also hand-bike athletes. A typical element of this triathlon is the fact that some competitors finish the race in a costume. Among these, Spiderman was the first to cross the finish line. Other characters came from the Belgian comic albums of Tintin, from the fairy tale Peter Pan, there was a Roman soldier, a Tarzan  look-a-like, a Chiquita Banana, and more.Today, English capital football club Arsenal F.C. announced Spanish defender Héctor Bellerín signed a "long-term" contract extension.21-year-old Bellerín joined the Gunners in 2011 from FC Barcelona's academy, La Masía, where he spent eight years.

Cousins was pulled over by police on Tuesday for erratic driving. Police charged the player with one drug charge and failing to provide a blood test.

Both teams from DuPage County, Illinois, United States, entered the game held at Naperville North undefeated, having won tournament titles during the Thanksgiving holiday and conference openers.  Benet defeated St. Patrick High School 41–27 in the East Suburban Catholic Conference opener last week.  The Redwings and the Huskies faced each other last year as well in the postseason regional opening round game, with the former defeating the latter.The two teams played evenly in the first quarter, but Naperville North's reserves achieved an 11–0 run starting at the end of the first quarter.  Benet did not score any goals in the second quarter, leaving it with a 15–27 loss at halftime.  The Redwings, however, began to recover in the third quarter with only eight turnovers and a 22–17 rebounding deficit, but they still lagged behind with a score of 27–37 at the end of the third quarter.  The team ultimately rebounded in the fourth quarter when senior forward Dylan Flood scored five consecutive three-point goals. With only 8.1 seconds left in the game and a tie of 42–42, Benet had possession of the ball and called a timeout.  Naperville North fouled twice and also called a timeout with 3.4 seconds left.  Junior guard Dave Sobolewski received a pass from Flood and scored a three-point goal at the buzzer, leading Benet to victory as fans stormed the court.  "I was lucky enough to hit it," said Sobolewski. Due to the victory, Benet earned a record of 5–0, while that of Naperville North was 5–1.  Benet will continue to play several away games over the next few weeks and into the Christmas and New Year holiday, with only one of its first thirteen games being a home game.  The home game will be played against Marian Catholic High School on Saturday night.  One school Benet surely will not be playing against this year, however, is St. Francis High School.  In an address to the student body last year, Principal Stephen Marth ended the long-lasting rivalry with St. Francis, citing concerns about student misconduct during the game held between the two schools on February 14, 2009.  Benet and St. Francis are not in the same conference.Lisbon, Portugal — Portugal's most successful team, Benfica, have sacked their manager after the 1st match.

The 80-year-old billionaire was treated in hospital for head injuries he sustained in the attack, in which the four muggers stole £200,000 of jewellery from him and his 31-year-old girlfriend. The attack occurred as Ecclestone visited his company's office with girlfriend Fabiana Flosi—who was reportedly "shaken" but uninjured—in central London. "There can be little doubt that this was a targeted robbery because of who Mr. Ecclestone is," a police source said. "The muggers were callous and showed little regard for the victims. They need to be caught." Police confirmed that "[a] man was taken to a west London hospital for treatment to a minor head injury and was subsequently discharged. There were no reports of any other injuries. Officers from Westminster robbery squad are investigating. There have been no arrests and inquiries continue." Four years ago, Ecclestone was mugged as he parked his car outside his £10 million home in Chelsea Square; two wheels were taken from the car.The body of former Manchester United player, George Best, has arrived in Northern Ireland.

Biarritz was able to put the loss of the Heineken Cup final to Munster behind it and run 40 to 13 winners in France's domestic championship, claiming its second title in a row. The final was played at Stade de France in Saint-Denis on Saturday.

Jockey Kent Desormeaux gave Big Brown a stalking ride, even as he was 4-wide along the backstretch. Once they reached the top of the stretch, Big Brown grabbed the lead and won going away, 4 3/4 lengths away from filly Eight Belles. Desormeaux wins his third Kentucky Derby, while trainer Richard Dutrow savored his victory after having bragged about how well his horse is for the Derby. Shortly after the race finished, Eight Belles collapsed on the backstretch, shattering her two front ankles. She was euthanized minutes later. Veterinarian Larry Bramlage conceded that "there was no possible way Eight Belles could be saved... that's an injury that's very painful." The moment was bittersweet for trainer Larry Jones, who sent Eight Belle's stablemate Proud Spell to victory in the Kentucky Oaks.Sent off 2-1 as the post-time favorite, Big Brown paid $6.80 to win. The $2 exacta (20-5) paid $141.60. The $1 trifecta (20-5-16) paid a healthy $1,722.80 with 13-1 shot Denis of Cork, and the $1 superfecta (20-5-16-2) paid a very respectable $29,368.90 with 37-1 shot Tale of Ekati.

Princess Leia hairstyles were also popular amongst the crowd.The sport has become very popular, and the bout was sold out. Nine new skaters have joined the four Canberra teams this year, and another fifteen are in training for their debut next year.  The bout got off to a fast start with a power jam enabling Short Stop to run up thirty points. This helped the Black and Blue Belles skate to a lead of almost 100 points by half time. Instead of playing Short Stop as jammer, she became a pivot. An aggressive defence allowed the Black and Blue Belles to add points to their score line. The final result was a 107 point victory.  This was the two teams' first bout of the year. It was the second bout on the Canberra Roller Derby League calendar. The Brindabelters met the Red Bellied Black Hearts on March 23 in a close contest. It was also their first bout played under the new rules. The Women's Flat Track Derby Association changed the rules earlier in the year.  Half time entertainment was a exhibition of pole dancing. The dancers were joined on the poles by Short Stop, who is also in the running for Miss Pole this year, joined in, still wearing skates. In February, she was voted Australia's greatest female athlete in an online poll, after an extensive eight month long social media campaign on Facebook and Twitter.A trivia night in April raised funds for a Roller Derby Tournament to be held in Canberra on the Queen's Birthday long weekend on June 8–9.New Zealand's national cricket team, the "Black Caps", made One Day International Cricket history yesterday when they inflicted a ten wicket defeat on an under-strength Australian side, at Wellington. It is the first time in O.D.I. Cricket history that Australia has suffered a ten wicket loss.It is also the first time in over a year that New Zealand have beaten Australia. This lends credibility to the view that the current New Zealand side has a culture of mediocrity, as they have not beaten a top-level side at full-strength for a long time.New Zealand won the toss and elected to field first. Australia were already in trouble, when by the fourth over they had lost two wickets for a mere 16 runs, the damage coming from New Zealand's pace bowler, Shane Bond, who finished the day with a five wicket haul including a spectacular caught-and-bowled off Australia's Cameron White.With Australia bowled out for an unimpressive 148, New Zealand took up the bat and reached the target in only 27 overs. The partnership between Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming was unbreakable, despite several close shaves.  A few key members of the Australian side were conspicuously absent, notably Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Brett Lee. However, Australia (currently world no.1) has lost four of its last five One Day International matches only two months before the International Cricket World Cup. If Australia lose either of their next two matches against New Zealand, they will slip to no.2 position, with South Africa occupying first place on the ICC's one-day rankings.Another FA Cup replay occurred last night, featuring Blackburn and Arsenal at Ewood Park.  The previous game was played to a 0 - 0 draw, with defensive strength showing on Blackburn's side.  This game went much the same way, with Arsenal controlling the game, but not delivering any potent strikes.  Arsenal had an appeal for a penalty when keeper Brad Friedel brought down Jermie Aliadiere in the box, but referee Graham Poll dubbed the challenge fair.  Arsenals best chance came through Julio Baptista, who tried to head in a Denilson free kick, but the attempt sailed over the crossbar, not troubling Brad Friedel.  Blackburn had their own chance on 53 minutes, but Morten Gamst Pederson's shot flew wide of the post after he did well to make space in the box.  10 minutes later, Blackburn made two substitutions, putting Benni McCarthy and David Dunn into the match at the exspense of Tugay and Nonda.  Arsenal made a change several minutes later, as Clich replaced Traore.  Baptista continued to threaten the Blackburn goal, but a great save from Friedel and a misplaced header kept the game tied. As the game drew close to extra time, Benni McCarthy produced a wonderful goal, as he beat out Senderos and curled the ball into the top left corner. Arsenal attempted to strike back, but they left it too late, as Blackburn advanced to the next round.Blackburn will play Manchester City in the next round of the FA Cup.The Los Angeles Clippers professional basketball team selected power forward Blake Griffin as the first overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden in New York City.Griffin, who won ten different player of the year awards for the 2008–09 season, was widely considered by analysts to be the draft's top pick. In his sophomore season at the University of Oklahoma, Griffin averaged 22.7 points, 14.4 rebounds, while shooting 65.4 percent from the field.Griffin said that he was relieved after NBA commissioner David Stern called his name as the first draft pick."It's great to know exactly where I'm going and have it set in stone," Griffin told the University of Oklahoma web site, SoonerSports.com.He added that he is not worried about the past failures of the Clippers, saying that he was looking forward to his future with the organization."We're not going think about what's happened in seasons past," Griffin said. "We're just excited about the opportunity and going to make the best out of whatever situation we're put in."With the second overall pick, the Memphis Grizzlies chose University of Connecticut junior Hasheem Thabeet. The Oklahoma City Thunder chose Arizona State sophomore James Harden as the third overall pick. Fourth, the Sacramento Kings chose Tyreke Evans, a freshman from the University of Memphis.With the first of four picks in the first round of the draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves chose 18-year-old Ricky Rubio, a guard from the Spanish professional team Joventut Badalona, before selecting Jonny Flynn from Syracuse University as the sixth overall pick. Later, the Timberwolves chose two players from the University of North Carolina: guards Ty Lawson and Wayne Ellington as the 18th and 28th picks respectively. The Timberwolves later traded Lawson to the Denver Nuggets for a future first-round pick.Also in NBA news Thursday, the Cleveland Cavaliers aquired veteran center Shaquille O'Neal in a trade with the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal will join 24-year-old LeBron James on the Cavaliers and the Associated Press predicts that O'Neal and James could equal some of the greatest duos in NBA history: "Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bob Cousy and Bill Russell, Shaq himself and Kobe Bryant."Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) football manager Laurent Blanc has signed a two-year contract extension with the French Ligue 1 winners.Blanc joined the Paris side in 2013, and helped them win consecutive titles in Ligue 1 and one domestic treble last season.

Blanc previously managed Bordeaux and won the league with them.FIFA has suspended two of its senior officials amid allegations that they bribed voters ahead of the organization's presidential election, while Sepp Blatter has been cleared of ignoring these activities and is now set to be re-elected as FIFA chairman on Wednesday.Mohamed bin Hammam, head of the Asian confederation, and Jack Warner, head of the Caribbean and North American (CONCACAF) federation, were both suspended from any involvement with association football pending an investigation into the alleged bribery."Both bin Hammam and Warner were provisionally banned from future activity in football while a full investigation is carried out," announced Petrus Damaseb, chairman of the FIFA ethics committee. "There, they can confront their accusers."At a recent FIFA meeting in Trinidad on May 10 and 11, the committee heard that both bin Hammam and Warner were accused of offering US$40,000 in cash gifts to other national associations in return for their votes in the presidential election.Blatter was also summoned to the ethics committee following allegations that Warner told him in advance about the payments. The committee later accepted Blatter's testimony and cleared him of wrongdoing.This decision clears the way for Blatter to be run unopposed for re-elections as FIFA president on Wednesday.Team Canada and Phoenix Coyotes hockey captain Shane Doan says he'll quit his position after the Bloc Québécois political party raised some concern over an "ethnic remark" he made two years ago.A motion demanding officials from Hockey Canada and Sport Canada to appear before a House of Commons Committee on Thursday, was supported by the Conservatives, the Liberals, the NDP, and the Bloc Québécois."Sports Canada has certain objectives, and that includes reflecting what they call the Canadian reality," said Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe. "The government has just cut lots of money from community groups under the pretext that they didn't share the government's priorities. "Hockey Canada receives (public) money, right? We have a right to ask questions."The National Hockey League (NHL) defends his remark made in 2005 against French-Canadian Hockey referee Stephane Auger.According to a statement by NHL Linesman Michel Cormier, the game was a December 15, 2005 game which had the Phoenix Coyotes vs. Montreal Canadiens, it had four French-Canadian referees. He recalls himself, after the second period, skating to the Coyotes bench."While skating alongside me while I was headed toward my room, that's when [Doan] said the words, 'Fucking Frenchman, did a good job,' and he skated away," said Cormier recalling the event. "We were side by side."Doan, who has "strong Christian values", says he did, indeed, make a remark about the four referees but denies any bad language.Doan, who agreed to a $22.75-million five year contract with the Coyotes, says he was trying to calm down goaltender Curtis Joseph, who was angered that the Montreal Canadiens did not get a penalty. Doan says his real comment was: "Four French referees in Montreal, Cuje, figure it out."In January 2006, he launched a $250,000 lawsuit against former Minister of Sport and Liberal MP Denis Coderre for "falsely" accusing him of making the remark. Coderre, last year, demanded Doan be asked to not join Team Canada in the 2006 Turin Olympics. On April 2, 2007, Coderre filed a defamation lawsuit against Doan seeking $45,000 in damages."I take huge pride in playing for my country, I take huge pride in representing everybody," Doan said. "For them to question me, being the captain, is incredibly disappointing. For someone to...say that I'm a bad role model, I'd rather have you call me the worst hockey player in the world and I don't deserve to be on the team, anything like that, but don't question my character," he said. "I don't understand how someone can attack when I've been cleared by the NHL, I never said it, yet they can just throw it out in the House of Commons."Just today, Doan scored the game-winning goal in a 4-2 preliminary round victory over Norway at the Men's World Hockey Championship in Moscow, Russia.The NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets returned goaltender Steve Mason back to the OHL on January 11 after an emergency recall since January 7. Mason never played for the Blue Jackets during the recall.Before the recall, Mason led Team Canada to victory against Team Sweden in the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.The 19-year-old has played 3 pre-season games with the Blue Jackets and went 1-2-0 with a 1.78 goals against average and .913 save percentage. He was drafted 69th by the Blue Jackets in 2006.Football legend Sir Bobby Charlton has launched a new campaign he calls "There Must be a Better Way" to find a faster method to clear anti-personnel landmines. The initiative which comes under his "Laureus Sport for Good Foundation" and involves physicists, mathematicians and electronic engineers from the University of Manchester and Lancaster University. In addition the Mines Advisory Group, a  mine clearance charity, and the security systems company Rapiscan are involved.Charlton first became interested in the problem of clearing anti-personnel landmines while visiting Bosnia on a Laureus funded Spirit of Soccer camp.  He was appalled by the injuries he saw, especially to children, caused by abandoned anti-personnel mines. Later his visited Cambodia where there are estimated to be four to six million mines. Charlton was told it would take  100 years to clear the mines.On the way back to Manchester, passing through airport metal detectors, he thought that surely there must be a better way to detect landmines than the laborious method he had seen using only a metal detector and a bayonet. As the mines are made mainly of plastic and have only a small amount of metal every piece of metal including shrapnel must be investigated to see if it is a mine.He contacted Rapiscan and through them the University of Manchester to see if there was anyone who could help. The University has a number of scientists and engineers with relevant experience, including a project EMBody to develop the next generation walk through metal detector, in collaboration with Rapiscan and Manchester Airport, and work on a scanning metal detector used to image steel reinforcing bars in concrete.On June 12th a demonstration was arranged at a disused quarry where Sir Bobby and the Professors of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Physics were shown the power of explosives.  This included a demonstration where an explosive charge of about 50g of high explosive, about the same amount as a medium sized landmine, was placed under a sand-filled Wellington boot. The charge was detonated with a resounding bang that echoed around the quarry.  The boot was projected tens of metres in the air. And when examined the toe had been cut off and the rubber shredded. The shock wave from the explosives thumped the chests of the scientists even at a safe distance. One commented that there was no chance of using delicate instrumentation anywhere near a possible explosion and they had to seek simple solutions."Last time I saw a boot fly through the air like that it was against Bolton" said Charlton, but there was a sombre but excited mood as the scientists headed back to the University, buzzing with ideas.Chess prodigy and former world champion, Bobby Fischer, arrived by jet Thursday in Iceland after being released from prison in Japan the day before. Jailed 9 months in Japan for traveling without a valid passport, and dogged by a U.S. felony charge for violating a government sanction, the 62 year old eccentric chess genius was just last week granted Icelandic citizenship based on humanitarian grounds.In a first order of business to clear Fischer's way into Iceland, a lawsuit was filed by his lawyer where he alleges the U.S. government conspired to have him arrested, and that his right to "due process" was violated by not providing him notice of the revocation of his passport.Describing his detention as “…harsh conditions, amounting to torture,” Fischer said he was “kidnapped” by U.S. President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.The U.S. refuses to acknowledge Fischer’s status as citizen of Iceland, but the lawsuit blocks his deportation to the U.S. until the legal matter is resolved. Iceland does have an extradition treaty with the U.S., meaning Fischer’s troubles are far from over now. If deported to the U.S., the felony charge he faces could carry a maximum 10 year sentence.The U.S. charges Fischer with violating government sanctions 13 years ago against Yugoslavia. He traveled to Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, for a 1992 rematch against Boris Spassky, a Russian chess king, who Fischer defeated in 1972 to become world champion in a famous showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland.During his flight to a stop-over in Copenhagen while en route to Iceland, Fischer conducted an interview with AP Television News on board. "Bush does not respect law," he told the AP. "It's like in the comics, like Billy Batson used to say 'Shazam!' and he becomes Captain Marvel. He (Bush) just says 'Enemy Combatant! Now you have no legal rights.' It's a farce," he said. "This is absolutely cooked up between Bush and Koizumi."Very opinionated, but normally less outspoken, Fischer’s verbal attacks express outrage over the treatment he is receiving.Bobby Murcer of the old New York Yankees has died today; he was 62. He died due to brain cancer and died at Mercy Hospital in Oklahoma City; Murcer's funeral is being held in that city. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner stated that "Bobby was a great guy". He played four decades with the Yankees. He leaves behind his wife, 2 children Tori and Todd, as well as grandchildren. Commissioner Bud Selig of the MLB said, "All of Major League Baseball is saddened today by the passing of Bobby Murcer, particularly on the eve of this historic All-Star game at Yankee Stadium, a place he called home for so many years."Murcer won the All-Star team 5 years in a row from 1971 onwards. He retired in June 1983 and went into the broadcasting business. He was an announcer in 1989. He started playing baseball when he was 19 in 1965.  He received news that he had a brain tumour on Christmas Eve 2006. He was well liked in New York City and was said to be "folksey". In 1979 he famously won a game against the Baltimore Orioles shortly after learning that his friend Thurman Munson had been killed. After hitting a three-run home run and then a two-run single at the bottom of the ninth inning to beat Baltimore 5-4, Murcer won the game for Munson, and gave his bat to Munson's widow.Earlier today former England-manager Bobby Robson underwent surgery to remove a tumour from his brain.A statement was made saying the surgery went "very well", and that the tumour has been completely removed.The Football Association of Ireland hopes that Sir Bobby Robson will be able to resume his duties as a consultant for the Republic of Ireland team for the games against Cyprus and the Czech Republic in early October.Former England football manager, Bobby Robson CBE, will undergo surgery to remove a tumour on his brain today.Bobby Robson is 73-years-old, and has managed various soccer teams such as England, Newcastle United, Ipswich, Barcelona, PSV Eindhoven, Fulham, Sporting Lisbon and FC Porto. Currently, he is employed as a consultant for the Republic of Ireland team, but will miss their opening Euro 2008 qualifier against Germany in Stuttgart on 2 September. He has had cancer surgery 3 times prior. Bobby Robson said:"The tumour is in my brain, which sounds bad, but it is in a position where it can be removed relatively easily and it's extremely small - the size of a grape - which indicates they have caught it early."Robson was taken to hospital on 5 August 2006 after complaining about feeling unwell 10 minutes before the start of an Ipswich match. He was discharged on 7 August, and on 20 August it became apparent the incident was due to a brain tumour.A cricket team made up of Bollywood celebrities has beaten a Yorkshire opposition in a charity cricket match at Headingley, held as part of the International Indian Film Academy ("IIFA") Weekend in Yorkshire, England, celebrating Indian cinema and its stars.The "Bolly 11" team, consisting of Indian actors and cricketers, took on the Yorkshire 11 which featured former English cricketers, British TV stars and musicians and two members of Parliament.Amitabh Bachchan, film legend and IIFA Brand Ambassador inaugurated the event, followed by actor Salman Khan, and Shilpa Shetty who greeted excited fans.

According to Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, Puma CEO Bjørn Gulden informed the club of Usain's interest in practising with them.In remarks to magazine Kicker, Watzke said this was "neither a joke nor a marketing measure". He did say, "We wouldn't organise it during a period where we have a midweek game, of course, but perhaps during a preparatory phase or something like that". Watzke said BVB coach Thomas Tuchel is agreeable with the idea, but the club hasn't suggested offering the Jamaican a contract.Taking about a chance to play for his favoured club, Bolt said, "For me, if I could get to play for Manchester United, that would be like a dream come true. Yes, that would be epic."Bolt won three Olympics gold medals in this year's Olympics edition in Rio de Janeiro. Bolt has indicated he means to retire from athletics after next year's World Championships scheduled to be hosted in London in August.Around twelve people were killed in Iraq today while they were playing football on a makeshift pitch in a predominantly Shi'a area in west Baghdad. According to police, two bombs, which had been planted in the middle of the pitch, were detonated. It is thought most of the victims were children. Earlier today, Iraq’s President Jalal Talabani revealed Iraqi troops would take over safekeeping of the entire country from American troops by the end of 2006. He said the takeover would occur gradually but would be complete by the start of 2007.Yesterday, more than fifty people were killed across the country.On Tuesday, German football club Borussia Dortmund (BVB) announced Peter Bosz as their new head coach. Bosz, who spent one season with the Dutch Eredivisie runners-up Ajax, was to sign a two-year deal with the DFB Pokal winners BVB which runs through June 2019. Ajax's assistant coach Hendrie Krüzen also was to leave the Dutch side for Dortmund.The 53-year-old Dutch manager led the the Dutch capital club to a second place finish in the Dutch league Eredivisie, finishing just one point below Feyenoord Rotterdam and won a silver medal in the UEFA Europa League, losing 2–0 against Manchester United.Bosz's predecessor Thomas Tuchel led Dortmund to the DFB Pokal victory, third place finish in Bundesliga the last season and a qualification to next season's Champions League group stage. Two years ago, Tuchel succeded Jürgen Klopp and his side remained unbeaten in the home games. On May 30, days after winning his first trophy with Borussia Dortmund, the club announced Tuchel was sacked with immediate effect via their official website. "'Unfortunately we couldn't see a basis for continued work together built on trust with a successful outlook in the current personnel constellation.", the CEO said.Edwin van der Sar, Ajax's General Manager said, "I have mixed feelings about this transfer. When we brought Peter in to Ajax last summer, it wasn't our intention that our partnership would end after just one season. Especially in the Europa League, we've had an amazing season. For our players, and our coach, that has attracted extra attention from clubs in top European competitions. But we couldn't go so far as to bind him to his contract, and we worked out a good deal with Dortmund. It's now up to us, prior to the start of the pre-season, to sign on a good successor." ((nl))Dutch language: ‍Ik heb gemengde gevoelens bij deze overgang. Toen we Peter vorige zomer naar Ajax haalden was het niet de bedoeling dat na één jaar alweer een einde zou komen aan de samenwerking. We hebben, met name in de Europa League, een geweldig seizoen neergezet. Net als bij onze spelers trekt dat ook voor de trainer de aandacht van clubs uit de Europese topcompetities. Het ging ons te ver om hem aan zijn contract te houden en we zijn er met Dortmund goed uitgekomen. Het is nu aan ons om, voordat de voorbereiding begint, een goede opvolger te contracteren.Under former coach Thomas Tuchel, Borussia Dortmund's key players İlkay Gündoğan, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Dortmund then-captain Mats Hummels left Signal Iduna Park last season, but signed Ousmane Dembélé, André Schürrle, Marc Bartra and Mario Götze.This season, Dortmund signed Ömer Toprak, Mahmoud Dahoud, Dan-Axel Zagadou and Maximilian Philipp.In a deal announced yesterday, German association football defender Mats Hummels, the current captain of Borussia Dortmund (BVB), agreed to sign a five-year contract with his boyhood club — and arch rivals of Dortmund — Bayern Munich next season. The arrangement was conditional on Hummels undergoing medical tests before signing.Hummels previously spent twelve years with the Bavarians, Bayern Munich, coming from their youth system. He moved to Dortmund in 2007 after appearing that year in one Bundesliga match for Bayern.With BVB, center back Hummels won two Bundesliga titles, one DFB-Pokal Cup in 2012 when they won the domestic double under Jürgen Klopp; and a silver medal in the 2013 UEFA Champions League. He also won the 2014 FIFA World Cup."Mats is one of the best centre-backs in the world", said Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, chairman of FC Bayern München AG.

((de))German language: ‍Ousmane hat immer den Eindruck vermittelt, dass er sich nichts mehr wünscht, als für unseren besonderen Klub unseren intensiven Fußball in unserem einzigartigen Stadion spielen zu wollen.Dortmund’s Sporting Director Michael Zorc praised Dembélé's skills saying "Ousmane can play nearly every position in attack. He is strong one-on-one, he can play with both feet, he is good at nutmegging and dribbling, and he is fast and dangerous in front of goal." ((de))German language: ‍Ousmane kann in der Offensive fast jede Position spielen. Er ist stark im Eins-gegen-Eins, beidfüßig, trickreich, schnell und torgefährlich.The Frenchman would feature in the UEFA Champions League next season.

Hecking's predecessor André Schubert was sacked the day before, after one year of service at Borussia Park.Mönchengladbach has won only one out of its last eleven Bundesliga matches this season. Schubert began as an interim manager of the first team after Lucien Facts resigned from the coach position last September. Schubert led Gladbach to the fourth spot in Bundesliga. Schubert's last match as Gladbach's coach ended in a 2–1 loss against VfL Wolfsburg and they are just three points ahead of the relegation playoff.52-year-old Dieter Hecking began his coaching career in 2000 with a second tier club SC Verl. Hecking played most of his professional career matches in 2. Bundesliga.In 2003–04, Hecking guided VfB Lübeck in DFB Pokal semifinal. He helped 1. FC Nürnberg avoid relegation in 2009–10 and finished sixth in the Bundesliga in the following season. In 2014–15, Hecking won the DFB Pokal and the DfL-Supercup with Wolfsburg and finished the Bundesliga season as runners-up. They qualified for last season's UEFA Champions League. Hecking was sacked from Wolfsburg in October.Mönchengladbach's sporting director Max Eberl said, "We wanted to add fresh impetus after the developments of recent weeks with a new coach. Dieter Hecking is exactly the right man for that. He is a coach with a lot of experience, who has had a lot of success at different levels with different clubs" ((de))German language: ‍Nach der Entwicklung der letzten Wochen wollen wir mit einem neuen Trainer einen neuen Impuls setzen. Dafür ist Dieter Hecking genau der richtige Mann, ein Trainer mit viel Erfahrung, der auf unterschiedlichem Niveau mit verschiedenen Vereinen sehr erfolgreich gearbeitet hat.The national football team of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been banned by FIFA, the sport's international governing body. The ban comes after the Bosnian Football Federation (NSBIH) rejected a demand from FIFA to change its three-man presidency to a single president. The change was rejected on Wednesday during an NSBIH meeting, causing FIFA and European football governing body UEFA to make the decision to suspend the federation.FIFA and UEFA said in a statement that "[t]he NSBIH representative and club teams are no longer entitled to take part in international competitions as of 1 April 2011 and until the aforementioned problem is solved. This also means that, as of 1 April 2011, no NSIBH official or representative may participate in any international match or event."The Bosnia and Herzegovina national team's manager, Safet Susic, spoke out against FIFA's ruling, blaming politics for the demand not being met. He said "[t]here is absolutely no chance that the NSBIH might find a way out of the present deadlock and get the job done. These people are incapable of running the NSBIH properly, although this situation is partly a result of political orders because Bosnia is an ethnically divided country where a dysfunctional system has now caught up with football. Denying the players a chance to perform on the big stage through no fault of their own is like sending innocent people to prison."Bosnia and Herzegovina are currently competing in the qualifying stage of the 2012 European championship. Bosnia are only five points behind group leaders France, and hold a game in hand over both Belarus and Albania. Unless FIFA's ruling is reversed, it seems unlikely that Bosnia's next game against Romania on June 3 will take place.After 22 years of waiting, the Boston Celtics have won their 17th National Basketball Association championship, adding to the 16 that already hang from the rafters of the TD Banknorth Garden and before that, the old Boston Garden.The Celtics won the game 131 to 92 and won the series with 4 wins over their old rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers' 2.  The game was highlighted by Ray Allen's seven 3-pointers, tying the NBA Finals single game record, as well as the Celtics 18 steals, easily a single game record also.  Paul Pierce has been chosen series MVP.The season is noted for the biggest single-season turnaround in NBA history as the last Celtics season was considered to be one of the worst in franchise history.The Boston College men's basketball team defeated the North Carolina State Wolfpack at home in a 74-72 double-overtime thriller on Feb. 25. The BC Eagles, ranked #11 going in to the contest, left with a 22-6, 9-5 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference, while the NC State Wolfpack dropped to #19 after the game with a 21-7, 10-5 record.Boston College star Sean Marshall finished with 22 points, including three 3-point shots, while Craig Smith had 18 points, 14 rebounds and six assists for the Eagles. Ilian Evtimov led the Wolfpack with 16 points.BC outscored the Wolfpack by two in the first half, which was reversed in the second half.  Only Miller's second overtime 4-pointer put BC decisively in the lead and allowed them a victory.For the second time in four years, the Boston Red Sox have won the World Series Championship sweeping the Colorado Rockies in four games.  They won the deciding game 4 on Sunday night, 4-3. The Rockies, who went nearly undefeated in their final 21 games with just one loss and claimed the National League wildcard, seemed poised to put up a fight in the series after sweeping the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS, 3-0 and the Arizona Diamondbacks, 4-0 in the NLCS, and enjoying eight days of rest after beating the Diamondbacks.However, the Red Sox dominated the series from the outset. They earned their place in the series after coming back from a three games to one deficit against the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS. They managed to win their second World Series title in four years, after their nearly historic comeback in 2004 in which they won their first championship in 86 years and ended the "Curse of the Bambino".Mike Lowell received the World Series MVP Award which included a hybrid Chevy Malibu and a hybrid Chevy Tahoe. It is currently unknown at the moment if Lowell will resign as he has attained free agent status now that the season is over.The Boston Red Sox are once again headed to the World Series after being down three games to one. The Red Sox were most recently in the 2004 World Series, which they won.Last night's game ended with the Red Sox winning 11-2 over the Cleveland Indians. The $103 million rookie import from Japan, Daisuke Matsuzaka (nicknamed "Dice-K"), pitched five innings for Boston, allowing two runs on six hits.  Cleveland's Jake Westbrook started and took the loss. This proved to be a much better showing for Boston's "Dice-K" than his previous outing, which Boston lost.The Sox jumped out to a quick lead, scoring a run in each of the first three innings on a single by Manny Ramirez, a sacrifice ground-out by Julio Lugo, and a sacrifice fly by Mike Lowell. The Indians scored their first run on a Ryan Garko double in the fourth inning, and a Grady Sizemore sacrifice fly in the fifth made the score 3-2 in favor of the Sox.In the sixth inning, Hideki Okajima came in to relieve "Dice-K" and pitched two scoreless innings before Jonathan Papelbon came in to close in the eighth. He entered the game with runners on first and second and no outs, but quickly retired the side and in the ninth managed to maintain the nine run lead, once again giving fans a performance of his Riverdance style victory dance. In the seventh inning, Red Sox rookie second baseman Dustin Pedroia hit a two-run home run off of Rafael Betancourt that drove Boston's Fenway Park wild. Boston scored a total of 6 runs in a crazy eighth inning, on a single by J.D. Drew, a three-run double by Pedroia, and a two-run Kevin Youkilis home run which bounced off a large Coke bottle advertisement.  Betancourt gave up the first four runs, with the home run allowed by Jenson Lewis. Youkilis was the first batter he faced in relief of Betancourt.The Sox will go on to face the Colorado Rockies, the surging National League Champions. The series will begin October 24th, with the first game at Fenway Park.Australia's cricketer Brett Lee is out of the first Ashes test match - which starts on July 8 in Cardiff - with a torn muscle in his left side. He is also doubtful to play the second Test at Lord's, which begins on July 16. It will be at least two weeks before he can start training in the nets again."I am very very disappointed and gutted that I will not be there for the first Test match but I will find a way to bounce back," said Lee. "I still see myself hopefully playing a major role for Australia through the end part of the series, whether that's the second, third, fourth or fifth Test match depending on how things go."The fast bowler complained about soreness in his left side after playing the England Lions at Worcester. Scans on Monday revealed he has a tear to his rib muscle. Other reports have described the injury as a strained abdominal muscle.Kevin Pietersen commented on Lee’s absence  saying it was "a huge, huge, huge loss" for Australia.Australia now have to choose which player to pick as a replacement for Lee. Two likely options are spinner Nathan Hauritz or pace bowler Ben Hilfenhuas.England will start their campaign on Wednesday to attempt to regain the ashes after Australia completed a 5-0 whitewash last time.Legendary boxing great Muhammed Ali died on Friday aged 74 in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona in the United States. A family spokesperson said Ali had been admitted with respiratory problems. The former heavyweight champion lived with Parkinson's disease for decades, diagnosed in 1984.Born on January 17, 1942 as Cassius Marcellus Clay, he changed his name to Muhammed Ali after his 1964 conversion to Islam. In his professional career, Ali won 56 out of 61 fights — including 31 consecutive wins. He won the World Heavyweight Championship three times and had also won an Olympic gold medal in the light-heavyweight category.Often considered the greatest boxer of all time, Ali was the world heavyweight champion in the 1960s and 1970s. His famous fights with George Foreman in 1974 when he won his title back and against Joe Frazier are considered by many as two of the greatest fights in the sport's history.

Cappuccino, who died in Yardley, Pennsylvania on Monday, was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He started his career in the 1950s and officiated on some of the most famous fights in boxing history; these included 94 world championship fights.Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission executive director Greg Sirb paid tribute to Cappuccino. He said, in remarks to ESPN, "When he was in his prime, there is no doubt he was one of the top five referees in the world. [...] When he was reffing, he was poetry in motion. He had as much respect from the fighters as any referee there is. I just think they liked his style. He was straightforward. When you got Frank Cappuccino assigned to your bout, you knew you made it."Some of the most notable fights that Cappuccino officiated over include Lennox Lewis vs. Shannon Briggs, Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks, and the 2002 fight-of-the-year between Mike Ward and Arturo Gatti. He himself belonged to both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey boxing halls of fame.Cappuccino spoke openly about his friendship with notorious boxer Mike Tyson. He had said "I can't say a bad thing about Mike Tyson[...] He's always been very good to me." Cappuccino was the referee during six of Tyson's fights, including his 91-second victory over Michael Spinks in 1998.He refereed his last fight in 2008 and was a boxing judge up until 2010.

The IBF title was vacant ahead of this fight.Clottey won by a technical knockout after Judah was declared vision impaired. Judah had suffered a cut above his right eye, which was ruled an accidental headbutt by referee Robert Byrd.Boxing analysts, however, say replays show it was caused by a punch. Since it was past the eight round, the rules of the fight called for a decision from the ringside judges.Clottey was declared the winner 86-85 according to two judges and 87-84 by the third judge's card.Clottey has had two previous title attempts. One ended with what the The Canadian Press calls a "bizarre disqualification" to Carlos Manuel Baldomir in 1999.

De La Hoya replied, "No, you're my idol."File:Oscardelahoya vs pacquiao.jpgThe camp of Manny Pacquiao has previously claimed that "Golden Boy" had weaknesses the Filipino boxer would exploit. Trainer Freddie Roach accurately foretold the outcome when he earlier said, "I'm not saying we're not going to knock him out. If it happens, fine. We'll take it. What we're going to do is break him down round by round. We're working on staying away from the jab and the left hook. The hook is a power shot. But Oscar makes a mistake with his jab. I'm not saying what it is, but I've seen it."Meanwhile, sportinglife.com reported that Pacquiao "confirmed he's up for a showdown with Ricky "Hitman" Hatton, telling Sky Box Office: "My job is to fight in the ring, that's the promoter's job.

David's father, Chuck, said Monday that his son's last day wearing the jersey was April 23--his 12th birthday.Witthoft conceded his son was starting to become more concerned about his appearance after the jersey barely came down to his belt line. In 2007, Witthoft said he "would keep wearing it as long as [he] could get it over [his] head." His mother, Carolyn, had washed the jersey every other day and mended it when needed.Witthoft first gained national attention three years ago and attended his first Green Bay Packers game in December 2007 (a 34-13 Packers victory over the Detroit Lions). He's also planning to attend the September 8 game when the Packers retire Favre's No. 4 against the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football.Witthoft has considered sending the jersey to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.Brawn GP have completed their takeover of the Honda Racing F1 Formula One team. The management buyout, led by team principal Ross Brawn, was a result of Honda announcing their intention to withdraw from the sport in December 2008 as a result of the current economic climate. Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello, Honda's drivers for the 2008 season, will be retained by Brawn GP for the upcoming 2009 season. The team will continue to be based at Honda Racing F1's Brackley headquarters in Northamptonshire, England. Engines for the cars will be made by Mercedes Benz.Ross Brawn said of the announcement: "The vast experience and knowledge that both drivers bring to our team will prove invaluable as we aim to get up to speed in the shortest possible time to be ready for the first race of the season...I would also like to take this opportunity to pay due credit to our staff at Brackley. The levels of motivation and commitment that I have witnessed at the factory deserve the highest praise."The Managing Officer of Honda, Hiroshi Oshima, said that the company was "very pleased that we could sell the team to Ross Brawn, with whom we have been partaking in the challenges of F1 competition, and are grateful for his decision. We offer our sincerest wishes for the new team which will be led by Ross."The team have three weeks remaining until the opening round of the 2009 Formula One World Championship in Australia on March 23.London, England — Yesterday at London's Riverbank Arena, Brazil's 5-a-side blind football team took on China in both teams' final game of group play. Brazil won 1–0, topping Group B.Both teams came into the game with similar records. Each had one win and a draw, and were tied on goal difference. A win would see them through to the finals.  In case of a draw, the two sides would be reduced to drawing lots.Brazil won gold in 5-a-side football at both past Paralympic Games where it was included — Athens in 2004, and Beijing in 2008 where they defeated China 2–1 in the final. China won silver in Beijing even though they had no national team prior to hosting the Games there.There were about 150 people in the crowd at the Riverbank Arena when the game began, although this swelled to over 500 after half time. The weather was sunny and warm. There were a number of flags on display in the crowd, including the flags of Brazil, Turkey and France, and the ubiquitous Union Flag.The two teams had different rituals when their national anthems were played. The Brazilians had their hands over their hearts, whereas the Chinese stood at attention and sang while theirs was played. Most startlingly, they threw their hands up in the air and shouted at the end.  Five-a-side football players wear blindfolds to insure a level playing field, as some blind people are more blind than others. However, the goalkeepers are sighted, and, like the goalkeepers in regular football, can use their hands. When ball is in play, spectators are asked to be keep silent so the players can hear the ball, which has bells in it. It was quite loud, and audible from the bleachers. It is also heavier than a regular football. There are three guides for each team who tell players where the ball is. The blue artificial surface — the same used for the hockey during the Olympics — could be slippery at times. Occasionally the players would run into each other or the goal post. At one point, the Brazilian goalkeeper stopped the ball with his crotch, which caused his to fall to the ground writing in pain. The umpire cautioned him at one point but never produced any coloured cards.The playing field is smaller than a regular football pitch, and the goal is small. The pitch has walls on the sides that help to rebound the sound and the ball itself. Bouncing the ball of the side is a standard tactic. The rules are fairly similar to eleven-a-side football. The game consists of two 25 minute halves with a 10 minute break between halves. There is no off-side rule.Both sides played defensively, with three players back and one forward, so there was little passing but a lot of foot skill. In earlier games they played with two forward and two back. As a rule, the Brazilians favoured a more open style of play. The game was fairly even early on. Brazil had a couple of good shots at goal that the Chinese goal keeper was lucky to stop. China's Wang Zhoubin also had a shot at goal that bounced off the goal post with a resounding noise.About 21 minutes in, Brazil's Jeferson da Conceicai Goncalves scored the first goal. His teammates jumped all over field, and guides walked the players to the team celebration.  After half time, the defensive game continued, although Brazil started sending another player forward. Chinese attacks tended to still be from a single player. Shortly after halftime, a mix up saw two Brazilian defenders compete for the ball, and they nearly scored an own goal. Wang then made a spectacular shot which missed the goal. As the second half wore on, China switched to a two-forward formation. Li Xiaoqiang and Wang pressed a series of attacks, which garnered a lot of ooohs from the crowd but nothing on the scoreboard. Meanwhile, Brazil continued aggressively, with Marcos Jose Alves Felipe in particular looking threatening.   The Brazilian contingent in the crowd roared loudly at the final siren. Asked how he felt to have made the semifinals, Brazil Coach Ramon Pereira de Souza said: "I have no words. My happiness is shaped on all the faces of the players and coaches in the team. It was a difficult game. It is the passage to the next stage. Facing China is not like facing any other team. China has spectacular players."After 4:1 victory over Argentina, Brazil won this year's Confederations Cup yesterday. The match took place in Frankfurt, Germany, in very bad weather conditions.In 12th minute Adriano dribbled past some opponents and scored a great goal from over eighteen meters. Lux had no chance. Four minutes later Kaká scored the next goal with another powerful long shot from the outer of the penalty area. After that, the Argentinians seemed as if they lost belief in positive outcome, but they were determined to change the situation. Riquelme, Sorin, Placente and others were trying to score a goal, but were unable to do get one past the posts.At the beginning of the second half, in 46th minute, full-back Cicinho, who is currently playing for Santos, made a wonderful pass to Ronaldinho, and there was 3:0 on the scoreboard. Next goal, scored by Adriano, came about twenty minutes later, after Ronaldinho's pass.Argetinians still wanted to change the result. Two minutes after Adriano's goal, Pablo Aimar, a substitute, scored, but his team was unable to win.When the match were reaching the end, Brazilian substituters started to dance and be delighted over the title that they won.Brazil's first matches at the Confederations Cup were poor. Their draw with Japan, and loss to Mexico, made their supporters unhappy. But Carlos Alberto Parreira led the team to the top of competitions, which is considered a preparation for the World Cup.After being down 2–0 at halftime, Brazil defeated the United States 3–2 in the final round of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, claiming their third FIFA Confederations Cup finals victory.The match was held at Coca-Cola Park in Johannesburg, South Africa. The FIFA Confederations Cup has been held there as a prelude to next year's 2010 FIFA World Cup.The United States made its first appearance in any FIFA men's tournament final while Brazil made its fourth appearance in a Confederations Cup final (after 1997, 1999 and 2005). The victory may result in Brazil claiming the top position in FIFA's world football rankings.The United States, the CONCACAF Gold Cup champions, qualified for the match by defeating Spain in the semifinal round by a score of 2–0, just days after nearly being eliminated from the tournament. Brazil qualified for the match by defeating South Africa 1–0 last Thursday in the second semifinal match. Brazil was the defending Confederations Cup champion having won in 2005 and winners of five World Cups.Early goals by Clint Dempsey (10') and Landon Donovan (27') gave the United States a commanding 2–0 lead at halftime. Brazil quickly retaliated with two goals by Luís Fabiano (46' and 73') in the second half to tie the game. A goal by Lúcio (83') helped seal the comeback victory for the Brazilians while the team controlled the clock for the remaining ten minutes.Eight saves by USA goalkeeper Tim Howard helped stifle the Brazilian offense for most of the match until the latter end of the match. Brazil attempted 24 shots with 11 on goal while USA attempted 8 with 4 on goal.In other news, Spain defeated South Africa in the tournament's third place match 3–2.London, England — Last night at London's Paralympic Basketball Arena, the Brazil women's national wheelchair basketball team kept it close in a game with the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team before losing 52–50 to Australia. Brazil trailed by four with 32.3 seconds left in the game, narrowed the gap to two points with 1.3 seconds left but were unable to score in the final second.4.5 point player Lia Maria Soares Martin dominated for Brazil, scoring over half the team's points with 27 total. She led her team on defense with half the team's rebounds, pulling down 14 of them. The Belém native 24 year old who will celebrate her 25th birthday during the Paralympics plays club basketball for All Star Rodas, Belem.Brazil played aggressive basketball, with five players earning personal fouls including Soares Martin with 4, Debora Crislina Guimaraes de Costa and Lucicleia da Costa e Costa with 3 each, and Cleonete de Nazare Santos and Cintia Mariana Lopes de Carvalho with 1 each. The Brazilians pinched Australian players several times by trying to force them to go over their wheelchairs and lose their balance. Sportsmanship was still on display, with the Brazilians helping to set Australia's Kylie Gauci upright after Gauci's wheelchair tipped over.Brazil competed in the 2008 Summer Paralympics where they did not win a single match.  They are scheduled to play the next game of their London campaign this Saturday against Great Britain.The Brazilian football referee Edílson Pereira de Carvalho was detained by the Brazilian Federal Police on Saturday in Jacareí, a city 78 kilometers from São Paulo. According to the Public Prosecution Service, he refereed games in a partial manner so that only predetermined teams could win.The businessman Nagib Fayad was also detained in São Paulo. Both are suspected of being part of a group suspected of manipulating games in order to profit through million dollar bets on sport bettings websites.Brazilian prosecutor Roberto Porto said that investigators have 20 thousand hours of taped phone conversations back to October 2004 and that they have no doubt that Carvalho was fraudulently refereeing football games.According to the spokeman of the Federal Police, Victor Hugo Rodrigues Alves, a referee would be contacted by phone by Fayad who would inform the referee which team should win the game. Fayad would then place the bets on Internet websites. Part of the profit would be given to the referee. Rodrigues claimed that additional people were involved.On Saturday the referee told Federal Police that he favored various football teams while he administered games during the Liberators of the Americas Cup, Paulista Championship, and the Brazilian championship.On Friday, English football club Manchester City announced Brazilian forward Gabriel Jesus signed a contract extension adding two years to his contract with the club. Jesus's new contract runs until 2023.21-year-old Jesus joined Manchester City last year in January 2017 from Brazilian club Palmeiras for a reported fee of £27 million. Since then, the Brazilian has featured in 53 matches for the club in all competitions and has scored 24 goals. During his time at the Etihad Stadium the Brazilian has won the Premier League title as well as the Carabao Cup. Internationally, Jesus made his international debut in 2016 and he was part of the Brazilian squad for this year's FIFA World Cup in Russia but lost to Belgium in the quarter-finals.After signing the contract extension, Jesus told ManCity.com, "I can say that it was the best decision I've made in my life to come to Manchester City because whilst I'm here I'm improving as a professional and as a person. Also thanks to the Club for being so organised and focused since I arrived."Manchester City's footballing director Txiki Begiristain said, "Gabriel is undoubtedly one of the best young forwards in world football, so to have him commit his future to us is a huge boost. There's so much variety in his game. I know how much Pep [Guardiola, Man City's manager] enjoys working with him and I am really looking forward to watching his development in the coming years."Jesus was part of the Manchester City squad which won the 2018 Community Shield on Sunday, defeating Chelsea 2–0 at the Wembley Stadium.A professional football player from Brazil and a former police investigator are among seven people arrested in connection with a murder police called "barbaric". Flamengo goalkeeper, and captain, Bruno Fernandes is accused of hiring former policeman Marcos Aparecido dos Santos to kill his mistress.Police say Fernandes met Eliza Samudio, 25, at a party organised by another Flamengo player last year, and spent the night with the former model and pornstar, impregnating her.  Her refusal to abort the pregnancy is cited as the motive behind the killing.  Samudio has been missing since June 4th.  Police state she contacted them earlier to complain of violence and threats from Fernandes.  He is alleged to have attacked her and tried to force her to swallow an abortion pill in a complaint filed in October.  He supposedly told her, "[y]ou don't know me and you don't know what I am capable of – I'm from the favela."Police allege that Samudio was abducted from a hotel in Rio de Janerio and driven for six hours to reach a house belonging to Santos near Belo Horizonte. There, according to newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo, one of Fernandes's cousins, allegedly involved, said loud music was played to cover up the screams as "barbaric tortures" were inflicted upon her by Santos.It is alleged when she exclaimed she could no longer bear being beaten the ex-policeman responded "[y]ou are not going to bear it any more. You are going to die." Souza is said to have been present and witnessed both her torture and her strangulation. Although she remains missing, police state that they are confident she is dead and claim her remains were disposed of by being fed to at least one rottweiler. Remaining parts are said to be encased in concrete.The child, a boy, had already been born and is now four months old. Police say his mother was killed when she began attempts to prove the footballer, who was rumoured to have received an offer worth millions of dollars from AC Milan, was his father. Homicide investigator Edson Moreira is running the probe and was in no doubt of the footballing "idol"'s guilt: "[he is] a monster for what he did to this young lady."The investigation has been a major focus for Brazilian media. The nation has an upcoming presidential election and candidates were quick to express their views. Dilma Rousseff, who present president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wishes to succeed him, said "[t]his is a barbaric crime. The whole of Brazil is disgusted by such a barbaric and perverse crime." Rainforest campaigner Marina Silva, another candidate, expressed concern that "[w]e have repeatedly seen this kind of episode against the lives of women."Fernandes denied any involvement, claiming a "clear conscience". He has commented that he is concerned the investigation may hamper his prospects of representing Brazil at the 2014 World Cup. Currently in a jail cell, he was requested to provide DNA samples but exercised his constitutional right to refuse. His wife is also alleged to have been involved and is jailed as well. Santos has said, via his lawyer, that he too is uninvolved in any crimes.The New Zealand soccer team, the All Whites, was beaten 4-0 during a friendly match against Brazil in Geneva on Monday morning NZST.

The extended contract runs through June 2021. His previous contract was to expire at the end of the season.After signing the contract, Rodgers said, "It was an easy decision for me[...] Personally and professionally I’m in a great place, a few years ago I might have been in a rush but you learn through experience to appreciate what you have. What I have here is that I'm a supporter who got very, very lucky, but hopefully I can help to develop the club along with the people who are already here." The 44-year-old manager joined the Glasgow side in 2016 replacing Ronny Deila, and guided The Bhoys to the national league victory on Sunday. Celtic, who secured their sixth consecutive Scottish Premiership title with eight games to spare have a chance to complete a first domestic treble since 2001, having already won the Scottish League Cup and having qualified for the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup later in April under Rodgers. Rodgers narrowly missed out on the Premier League trophy with Liverpool F.C. in 2014.Rodgers enjoyed his first ever league victory with Celtic, and earned a spot in next season's UEFA Champions League's group stage. Celtic under Rodgers have extended an unbeaten streak to 38 matches in the Scottish league.Rodgers was sacked by Liverpool in October 2015 after three-and-half-years of service at Anfield; and former Borussia Dortmund's manager Jürgen Klopp filled his vacated spot. Peter Lawwell, Celtic's Chief Executive said, "Brendan has made a huge impact at Celtic already. He's an outstanding manager and we believe he is one of the best coaches in Europe, if not world football, and we're delighted that he has committed his future to Celtic."After playing 17 seasons in the United States' top professional football league, quarterback Brett Favre of the National Football League's (NFL) Green Bay Packers bid a final farewell to the sport in an emotional press conference at Lambeau Field on Thursday, saying he is "not up to the challenge" of another season."I know I can play. But I don't think I want to, and that's what it really comes down to," the 38-year-old Favre said.Favre, who officially retired on Tuesday, dressed for the hour-long event in an untucked button-down shirt, blue jeans, and days worth of stubble. "It is on my terms, which is a good way to go out," he said of his attire. He thanked the Green Bay Packers' organization, his family, and his fans for their support throughout his career, but reluctantly admitted it was time to move on. "I’ve given everything I can possibly give to this organization and I don’t think I’ve got anything left to give," he said, as tears welled up in his eyes. "What matters is it’s been a great career for me. It’s over. As hard as it is for me to say, it’s over."His retirement came as somewhat of a surprise to the Packers, who expected he would return for another year. Favre refuted the notion that the Packers did not do enough to get him to return, and assured the organization that nothing they could have done would have affected his decision. "I know there's been comments and issues in the press lately about why I'm leaving, whether or not the Packers did enough, whether or not Ted or (coach) Mike (McCarthy) convinced me to stay," Favre said. "None of those things have anything to do with me retiring, and that's from the heart."He instead offered a simpler reason for his departure: the stress of the job was getting to be too much "I don't think it would get easier next year or the following year," he said. "It hasn't up until this point. It's only gotten tougher and something told me 'You know it's gotten too hard for you.'"When asked about his future plans, he replied, "Nothing." This is a new phase in his life, he explained. "I am going to stick to that until I want to do something else." He and his wife, Deanna, said they will be putting all public events on hold for a year, because, as Deanna said, "Honestly, we both are really tired." He says they will still be involved with charities in the future, but not as extensively as before.Favre holds NFL records in most wins by a starting quarterback, most passing yards, most passing touchdowns and most consecutive games started. However, he says that "the statistics part wasn't that important. I was never really a statistics guy. I hope my legacy is a lot more than that."In 2007, he led the Packers to a 13-3 season, but lost in the NFC championship game to the eventual champion New York Giants. The final pass of his career was an interception that resulted in the Giants' game-winning field goal. Still, Favre believes he is "going out on top", and he could "care less what other people think". "One play, one game, one season, doesn't define me," he said. "It has been a wonderful career."Hotshot batsman Brian Lara has become the second player in test cricket history to score 11,000 runs.  Brian achieved the milestone while delivering a characteristic century to his West Indies team score sheet during day one of the final Test against Australia in Adelaide.  Lara scored an unbeaten 106 by tea and cucumber sandwich time and is now only 107 runs behind Test record holder Allan Border, who plundered and pillaged 11,174 runs in 265 innings.Lara already holds the records for the highest Test and first-class scores, 400 not out and 501 respectively.The first ever Olympic lottery scheme has been launched to the public in Britain, seven years to the day that the Olympics will be hosted to the City of London. A scratch card game will be one of the schemes that would be used to help make money for the Olympic Games in 2012. It is called "Go for Gold" and it costs £1 to buy. The actual amount that the National Lottery could give would be £1.5 billion pounds, but the lottery games would raise an estimated £750 million for sporting infrastructure.Olympics Minister and Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell said the game was needed now to raise the cash necessary to develop the venues that will host the event.She stated: "The Lottery needs to raise altogether £1.5 billion of which we estimate that £750 million over the seven years between now and the Games will come from the new Olympic lottery game." Coe stated: "Camelot have a very good record for raising money, certainly for good causes."The games went on sale on Thursday.A spokesperson for the Royal London Hospital has confirmed that British racing driver Henry Surtees has died following an accident at the Brands Hatch circuit earlier today. He was eighteen.Surtees was competing in the Formula Two championship when Jack Clarke's car spun off the track and into barriers ahead of him. A wheel and tyre detatched from Clarke's car and bounced across the track, striking Surtees on the head. Surtees was apparently knocked unconscious as the car continued straight on at the next corner and struck the barriers at speed with no attempt to brake. After the car came to a standstill one of the rear wheels continued to spin as the car remained accelerating; there was no further movement due to massive damage from the barrier impact.Surtees had only recently joined F2 at the start of the current season, having previously driven in the Formula Renault competition. Yesterday at Brands Hatch he celebrated his first podium in the series, earning third place.Son of John Surtees, a race driver who has held the 1964 Formula One championship and won the motorcycle world championships several times, Henry started off racing go carts and moved on to cars in 2006, competing in a junior championship.He went on to compete in the 2007 Formula BMW UK season, where he placed seventh overall. In that year he also contested in a limited number of Formula Renault races.

That year he also raced in the last races of the Formula Three season, where he earned another race win.Both his father John and mother Jane were watching the race in which their son was killed.The men's team final in artistic gymnastics reached a tense conclusion last night at the Olympic Games in London. China took gold with 275.995 points. Japan took silver with 271.952 points, and Great Britain got bronze with 271.711 points.Britain initially looked likely to win silver following a fall from the pommel horse by Japanese gymnast Kōhei Uchimura.

The US team vowed to fight on in the individual competition. Steve Penny from USA Gymnastics told reporters: "Our guys know that they're better than fifth place, and they're going to try to show that off through the rest of the competition."British snooker commentator Ted Lowe has died at the age of 90. Lowe, who received the nickname "Whispering Ted" due to his broadcasting style commentated on many of snooker's biggest events including the 1985 World Championship final between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor. His death has come on the same day as the first session of the 2011 World final.His wife, Jean commented on his death. She said "His health had been deteriorating for the last 10 weeks. He went into a hospice a week ago and I never left his side. But I could see he was slowly going. He still loves snooker and was watching it on TV."Tributes have been paid to Lowe by several snooker players and commentators. John Virgo said  "He set a standard for us all. He was wonderful, he had an impish sense of humour and while cricket had its John Arlott and Wimbledon had its Dan Maskell, we had Ted Lowe. He was one of the BBC greats. It's a sad day for snooker and he'll be sadly missed." Jimmy White also posted a message on social networking site Twitter saying "Still in shock and so saddened. Absolutely gutted. He was a great friend of my dad's and an absolute gentleman. I loved him dearly."As well as commentating on snooker tournaments Lowe hosted the BBC television programme Pot Black. Lowe is also remembered by viewers for his quote after colour televisions started to appear. During a game he said "He's going for the pink, and for those of you with black-and-white sets, the yellow is behind the blue."Snooker player Alex Higgins, nicknamed "Hurricane", was found dead in his apartment in Donegall Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland on Saturday. He was aged 61 and had been suffering from throat cancer since 1997.Born in Belfast on March 18, 1949, Higgins became the champion of the World Snooker Championship at the age of 23 in 1972. He reached the same achievement again in 1982. Higgins' final title victory was in the Irish Professional Championship in 1989.During 1986, he received a fine and was banned from five tournaments after headbutting a director of a tournament. He was also banned from playing for one year in 1990 after threatening to have Dennis Taylor, another snooker player, shot.Recently, Higgins lost all his teeth as the result of having treatment for his cancer. In May 2010, a charity dinner took place in Manchester, England that raised approximately £20,000 (US$30,997, €23,859, A$34,363, C$31,961) so as to allow surgery for new teeth for him to occur. However, Higgins was considered to be too unhealthy to have the surgery in Marbella, Spain.Dennis Taylor, now a snooker commentator at the BBC, stated that "[t]here was just something about the way he played the game — there was a little bit of [John] McEnroe in there. I don't think you'll ever see a player in the game of snooker like the great Alex Higgins."Philip Studd, another commentator of snooker for the BBC, has described the late snooker player as being "snooker's original troubled genius" and that Higgins was "[c]harismatic, flash, fast, unpredictable, combustible — you just couldn't take your eyes off the 'Hurricane'." Studd continued to explain that "[w]hile he could never match the consistency of Steve Davis or Stephen Hendry, Higgins on his day was the greatest of them all. He touched the heights in 1982 when he won his second world title. He pipped Jimmy White to the final thanks to a break still widely regarded as the finest ever made. His tears of triumph after beating Ray Reardon — wife and baby in arms — remains one of snooker's most iconic moments. Without Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins snooker would never have become one of the most popular television sports in the 1980s and beyond."A man from North London is currently training for an attempt at flying a hang glider across the UK from land's End to John O'Groats.Shola Ogunlokun a 41 year old married father of 3 who had never flown a hangglider before  taking up this challenge said  yesterday "I aim to fulfill a dream offlying, use the challenge as an  opportunity to meet the people of Britain andencourage people of similar ethnic  backgrounds as me to pursue their dreams".Shola is on stage 2 of a 3 stage training programme, and has flown a glider offa 2000ft  mountain on completion of stage 1 of his training.

BSkyB, which dominates the satellite TV market, has held the rights to the broadcast Premier League games since 1992. They paid £1.02bn for its current three year contract.Setanta has approached the managing director of BSkyB, Trevor East, with the intention of luring him to Setanta to lead the acquisition of sports rights. Mr East, who's contract runs out soon, has not yet made a decision, but should he decide to sign a contract with the Irish station, it would be a massive boost to their ambitions.Setanta initially started out by broadcasting GAA games to Irish people living abroad particularly in the US. Today, backed by an investment by AIG, it is pursuing an ambitious plan to grow its business - it currently broadcasts the Scottish Premier League and earlier this week it bought control of North American Sports Network. North American Sports Network broadcasts baseball, NFL football, basketball and Nascar motor racing outside the US. Also in the planning stages is a European sports station for the US market.In the NHL the Buffalo Sabres beat the New York Islanders 3-0 in a shutout on Thursday night to tie the NHL record for the best start to a season. The current record holders are the Toronto Maple Leafs."I mean, it's very exciting. I think we're all proud of what we've accomplished so far. But at the end of the day, it's not what we're aiming for down the road," said Daniel Briere, the co-captain for the Sabres."We want to be having these kinds of streaks in the playoffs. What we're doing now is carrying momentum. I think it will serve us well in the future, but right now we just need the points," said Ryan Miller, one of the Sabres goalies.Currently Buffalo is 10-0-0 and is currently the top team in the NHL.

The vote was held after animal rights activists, led by Catalonian animal rights group Prou! (Catalan for "Enough!"), who claim the practice is "barbaric", collected 180,000 signatures to a petition.In other areas, such as Portugal and southern France, the bulls, which are specially bred for fighting, are not killed in the ring.  The ban, which passed with a 68–55 majority and nine abstentions, will come into force in Catalonia in January 2012, making the region the first place in mainland Spain to outlaw the practice. Supporters of the practice claim that it is an art form which forms an important part of the Spanish culture, and fear that the ban could be the first of many in Spain. They also say that many jobs would be lost as a result of the ban, with estimates that it could cost €300 million in lost revenue. Both the main parties in the Catalan parliament took the unusual step of allowing their members a free vote in the debate, which saw high emotions on both sides. The debate was officially over the animal welfare concerns; however, many believe that the underlying issue of Catalan nationalism played a significant part in the outcome. Some expressed the opinion that Catalonia, which, while officially part of Spain, has its own language and flag, was attempting to distinguish itself from the rest of Spain by outlawing one of its most famous traditions.The Bulls rugby team has managed to reach the semi-finals of the Southern Hemisphere provincial rugby union competition, the Super 14. Despite entering the match with the burden of having to score 32 points and receiving a bonus point (by scoring four tries). The Bulls managed to overcome fellow South African team, the Stormers, at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town on Saturday May 13, winning the match 43 points to 10 in the final round of the regular season.Entering the final round of the regular season, the Bulls and fellow South African Durban-based Sharks, as well as the Australian Canberra-based Brumbies were the only sides in contention for the fourth and last finals position. After the Brumbies, who unlike the Sharks were actually ahead on the number of points, were soundly defeated by the Canterbury-based Crusaders, 33 points to 3, the result meant that either the Sharks or Bulls could mathematically take fourth position on the ladder. The Sharks stormed to victory over Perth-based Western Force, winning 41 points to 25, meaning that the Bulls would have to score at least four tries to be ensured of a bonus point, to move ahead of the Sharks, who were now sitting in front of them on points difference.Despite the set back of both prop Danie Thiart and captain Victor Matfield to the sin-bin in the first half, the Pretoria-based Bulls entered halftime leading 26 points to 3. A try to the Stormers happened in the opening minute of the second half, though the Bulls held on to the victory. Bryan Habana scored the last try, which was subsequently converted and pushed the Bulls into fourth place on the table on points difference. The Bulls will now faced the Crusaders in New Zealand next week for a spot in the final, the other spot is to be contested also in New Zealand, between the Wellington-based Hurricanes and the New South Wales Waratahs.Yesterday, Milan Lučić's family returned home and found their home ransacked by burglars.

On Saturday Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper also stated there were no plans to boycott the Games,  set to start March 7.Baird is quoted in as saying, "We don’t want the athletes to pay the price for this.[...] But politically...

The Canadian government is considering expelling the Russian ambassador from the country.

One end of the hockey stick is very hard and used to propel the player down the ice.  The other side looks like a smaller version of a traditional ice hockey stick and is used to hit the puck.  Players compete while sitting in a sledge, which has two blades at the back that can be no longer than a third of the length of the sledge.  The height of the sledge off the ice is high enough that the puck may pass under it.Mattamy Athletic Centre, Toronto, Canada —Canada has won the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship at the Mattamy Athletic Centre in Toronto, defeating Germany 54–50 in the gold medal match yesterday afternoon.

Ouellett tipped once, and bounced in her chair, with a wheel leaving the ground as she attempted to block shots and steal the ball. Ouellett and Australian Cobi Crispin locked wheels, and required a break in the game where Australia's coach came on to the court and removed Ouellett's wheel to detach the pair before putting it back on again.Following the game, Australia's Amber Merritt said of playing Canada, "I have the utmost respect for Canada. They're a great team, but we'll refocus on the game tomorrow [against the Netherlands] and go out and play like we know we can, the Australian way."Prior to the start of the game, McLachlan was the team's dominating player in the competition.

The game is planned as a gauge for expansion east to an Atlantic city but with ticket prices at $40 and $62.50 (Canadian), CFL commissioner Tom Wright admitted they were considerably more expensive than the average price for other season-ticket holder single games which, he said, is "in the mid to high $20 range".At the news conference in Halifax, Wright defended the prices as necessary to break-even with the additional costs required to set-up the game and temporarily expand Huskies Stadium from 2 000 to 10 000 seats and comparable to similar, one-time events.Events Halifax chairman Fred MacGillivray said he is confident that the showcase game will be a success. "I think the general public's reaction to this event will tell the CFL that there are a lot of people in the Maritimes who want to see CFL football and we feel very confident we'll have a full house for that event in June", he told the news conference.Hamilton head coach Greg Marshall agreed and said he thinks expansion to Halifax is viable. "Halifax is the natural site and it's just a matter of coming up with the facility", he said. "I think there's a lot of interest here and I think there's a lot of interest in the CFL to put a team here."Events Halifax and the CFL have also set up a number of events surrounding the game including a Friday-night kickoff party, a schools program, open team practices with player autograph opportunities and a pre-game festival.CFL fans watch with interest how ticket sales will do when they go on sale on April 8 as the league considers expansion in 2008.Canadian gold-medalist Myriam Bédard is facing a January 5 extradition hearing from the United States, after she was arrested and charged with abducting her 12-year old daughter Maude. The Biathalon athlete is arguing she should be allowed to return to Canada on her own.Bédard had taken her daughter to Washington D.C. with her new husband, Nima Mazhari, on October 2, violating the terms of her divorce settlement from Biathalon coach Jean Paquet. Mazhari, who is a sculptor, was charged with the unrelated theft of $100,000 worth of paintings last year.Paquet filed a report with the Sûreté du Québec on December 8, stating that Bédard had violated the divorce terms, and an international arrest warrant was issued.On December 20, the case was brought to the attention of Interpol, and two days later the United States Marshals Service announced her arrest in Columbia, Maryland, at a hotel celebrating Maude's 12th birthday. Maude was taken into the custody of the Marshals Service for three days, before being returned to her natural father.Defence attorney John Pepper is arguing that the United States should be obligated to release Bédard on bail as she hasn't been formally charged with any crime, pending her extradition to Canada, where she faces two charges, child abduction and violating a custody order.Pepper is also arguing that the three-time Olympic medalist was seeking refuge from "bureaucratic terrorism" in Canada, a claim that Bédard made in a letter she sent to the International Olympic Committee, Kofi Annan and US ambassador David Wilkins explaining why she was leaving Canada.Bédard gave testimony during the Sponsorship scandal, where she stunned the courts by alleging that advertising firms had been engaged in narcotics trafficking, that her current husband was responsible for the decision not to send the Canadian Forces to Iraq, and that Formula One driver Jacques Villeneuve had been paid $12 million to wear a Canadian flag, claims that were not verified by other sources.Bédard is facing growing doubts about her mental state, which her attorney says are attempts to "belittle" her, due to personal grudges and her role in the scandal.Canadian Olympic swimmer Mike Minenko has announced his official retirement from the sport.

He started to be a fan of curling in Winnipeg Manitoba 10 years ago and said his father used to play it."I've never curled but my father did when I was very young," he said. "I've followed the Brier for years. About the last decade or so I've made an effort to get to the Brier when I could. It is such a great Canadian tradition."He cheered on for Alberta's Kevin Martin. Martin won 9–8 over players from Nova Scotia. Harper met with Kevin Martin after the event. Martin handed the PM his jersey from Monday's game."I've obviously got a soft spot for Kevin Martin and Alberta because he's had such a great career," said Harper. "But what's so great about the Brier is whoever wins is not like your normal pro athlete. They're usually great community people and Canadians. It's always easy to identify with whoever goes forward."Robin MacPherson of Hamilton sat in front of him. She wore a large crown and was draped in gold.She got to meet the PM and was quoted saying: "Not a lot of people get to meet a prime minister."Former professional wrestler and manager Luna Vachon has died at the age of 48.

The cause of death was announced as cancer by his family. Francis had been battling the disease for five years. Francis had worked with several athletes including disgraced runner Ben Johnson.  Johnson won a gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later disqualified after testing positively for steroid use.  During a national enquiry Francis admitted introducing Johnson to steroid use. During the enquiry Francis spoke about Johnson’s steroid use saying that "He could decide either he wanted to participate at the highest levels in sport or not. If he wanted to compete, it's pretty clear that steroids are worth approximately a meter at the highest levels of sport”. After the enquiry Francis was banned for life by Athletics Canada. He briefly trained Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones for a time in 2003. He continued to believe that steroids are necessary in athletics.A trio of Canadian trekkers said Friday they completed the fastest unaided on-foot trek using the traditional route from Hercules Inlet on the Ronne Ice Shelf to the South Pole in a record time of 33 days, 23 hours and 30 minutes. Ottawa ultra-runner Ray Zahab, age 39, adventure journalist and architect Kevin Vallely, age 44, of Lynn Valley, North Vancouver and North Pole expeditionist Richard Weber, age 49, said they completed the 700-mile (1,130-kilometer) journey, at 10,000 feet altitude, finally arriving early Wednesday morning.They endured a white-out but survived on a 7,000-calorie-a-day diet of pemmican, Gatorade drink powder, outdated salami, deep-fried bacon, cheese and butter. "If you took a cloud, wrapped it around your head and then duct-taped it, that's what a white-out is like," Mr Zahab, explained. The trio also suffered altitude sickness, vertigo, massive, painful blisters, and temperatures as low as minus 40. Zahab had to pull 170-lb (77-kg) sleds of equipment, traveling on foot and on snowshoes while the other two men skied. According to ExplorersWeb.com's founder, Tom Sjogren, the trio erased the previous record of 39 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes, which was set by American Todd Carmichael, the first American to cross Antarctica to the South Pole alone, on foot and with no assistance. He arrived at The Pole on December 21, 2008. "They have definitely broken the record," said Sjogren. Guinness World Records spokesman, Damian Field, in London, however, said that "Guinness monitors a category for fastest unsupported trek to the South Pole, but it has no record currently listed." Prior to Carmichael, the record was held by Briton Hannah McKeand. In the fastest journey to the South Pole (600 nautical mile journey), she completed solo and in just 39 days, 9 hours and 33 minutes. In March 2008 she attempted to reach the North Pole alone and unsupported but had to abandon the trip after falling through the ice and badly damaging her shoulder.Ray Zahab is a Canadian ultramarathon runner, personal trainer, and motivational speaker. He lives in Chelsea, Quebec, and is famous for his 4,300-mile (6,920-kilometer) epic run across the Sahara Desert in 2007, which was the subject of a documentary narrated by actor Matt Damon's "Running the Sahara." He heads Impossible2Possible, a nonprofit organization which advocates planet protection. "I started looking at impossible places on the planet in the past year, and I said Antarctica is one of those impossible places, and if we can create an expedition, perhaps we can inspire a bunch of young people to realize they can achieve,' Zahab said.Richard Weber, M.S.M. (born June 9, 1959 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a world-renowned Canadian Arctic and polar adventurer, from Alcove (near Wakefield). From 1978 to 2006, he participated in, lead and organized more than 45 Arctic expeditions. Richard is the only person to have completed six full North Pole expeditions. He has therefore trekked to the North Pole more than anyone in history.The trio were waiting out a storm before boarding a flight to Chile for Ottawa. "I'm pretty tired, actually," said Kevin Vallely, calling from Patriot Hills, Antarctica. During the saga, Vallely was solely burdened with carrying the high-tech gear in his sled consisting of video cameras, satellite phones, hand-held computers, different kinds of solar panels, batteries and wires chargers. "Had we not brought all that stuff we probably would have got it done faster because we wouldn't have had to carry all that weight, but then it doesn't matter as much," he explained. Vallely said he also intends to produce a documentary of the expedition.London, England — Tuesday, the Canadian Paralympic Committee held its first press conference for the Games, with the Chef de Mission, flag bearer, a first time Paralympian, and a four time wheelchair racer talking about where Canada is likely to earn medals.  The Canadians also discussed how the movement in the country has grown since the 2010 Winter Paralympics and increases in government spending on Paralympic sport.Earlier today, the Australian women's semi-professional basketball team Canberra Capitals announced a formal transfer of the club to University of Canberra.  Prior to the transfer, the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) club was owned and operated by Basketball Australian Capital Territory (BACT).The deal includes the WNBL operating license, and involves the team being renamed to the University of Canberra Capitals.  The transfer still requires formal approval from Basketball Australia and the WNBL Commission.  It does not include ownership of other BACT teams including the Capitals Academy SEABL team, the Canberra Gunners, and the Gunners Academy.The Capitals have failed to qualify for the WNBL finals for the past three years, and current head coach and former national team coach Carrie Graf says the change will improve the team's potential for success.  She is quoted in a Basketball ACT press release saying, "The University is committed to supporting women in sport where often female athletes are unable to dedicate themselves to their sport in the same way as male athletes.  The transfer will enable Capitals players to establish flexible working, living and studying arrangements through the University so that they are able to have a stronger focus on basketball while at the same time preparing for life after basketball."The Canberra Times reports the ownership change will make it easier for the team to recruit top young talent as the team will be able to provide food, housing, tuition, and a basketball salary.  On the reported downside, University of Canberra chief executive Joe Roff has said the University will not be able to increase player salaries.The University of Canberra is recognized as one of the best sports universities in Australia, has a sports studies department, and currently has a naming rights agreement with the Brumbies professional rugby union team in Canberra.Belconnen, Australian Capital Territory —Wednesday night, the Canberra Capitals defeated the Chinese women's national B basketball team 75–64 at the Belconnen Basketball Centre in a pre-season warm up game before the start of the Women's National Basketball League in October.Several new players joined the Capitals this season, including Samantha Norwood, Valeria Ogoke, and Tessa Lavey, while Natalie Porter, Carly Wilson, and Marianna Tolo are not with the team this season.Playing before a packed crowd, the game started with both teams' national anthems played, followed by the Capitals giving their guests mini-basketballs.  Canberra started with Nicole Hunt, Jessica Bibby, Samantha Norwood, Ogoke, and Michelle Cosier on the floor.  China's starting lineup included Liang Jiamei, Ma Xueya, Cui Xiaoxue, Huang Hongpin, and Shen Yi.The Capitals led early in the first with a score of 6–2 and then 6–4, before Jiamei made a three pointer to put China ahead 6–7 by the time there was 6:33 left in the first.  Both teams made a number of substitutions in the first quarter and tried to shoot 3-point shots that they did not land.  The Capitals could not keep their hands on the ball, turning it over several times in the first.  Playing a zone defense, the Chinese team appeared to have better control on their side of the court when playing zone defense on that side of the court, while the Chinese offense frustrated the Capitals who were playing man-to-man and appeared to lose the woman they were marking.  The Chinese were also quick to foul, allowing Canberra to go into bonus.  The quarter ended 13–19 thanks to a last minute shot by Hunt.The second quarter started with a Canberra possession, where they turned over the ball to China before they were able to get a shot up. Ogoke managed to steal the ball back before China could capitalize on the turnover.  The Chinese bench started making noise on the bench, cheering and chanting to support their teammates on the court.  The Capitals coach, Carrie Graf, was very animated on the sidelines. Chinese fouls sent Canberra to the line several times, with Norwood scoring a pair with 1:41 left in the half. Dombkins made a pair of baskets in the remaining time to bring the score to within two by end of the quarter.At the end of the first half, with the score 31–33 in favour of China, Norwood led the Capitals in scoring with 11 points and was the only team member in double digits. Mikaela Dombkins and Hunt both had 6 points, with six total Capitals players having gotten points on the board.   On the Chinese side, Sun Mengran led her team in scoring with 12 points.  Jiamei was second with 5 points, and seven other players also scored.Contrasting half time styles saw the Capitals go into the locker room, while China stayed on the court and practice shooting baskets.  When the second half got under way, Ogoke scored for Canberra to tie up the game. China scored to go up again, but Cosier then drew a foul, went to the line and made a pair of baskets to tie the game again. Ogoke scored again and the Capitals went ahead by two.  Bibby quickly added to the lead with another 2 points. Following a Chinese time out, China took advantage of a free throw opportunity to narrow the score to 39–37.  Canberra fell apart a bit, with Cosier turning over the ball and Bibby missing a pass because she was out of position.  Thee Capitals were not marking players, leaving the Chinese shooters open, but they could not get the ball in the net. A 3-point shot by China had them ahead by one. With 5:27 left in the third, Canberra was leading by three. By the time there was 1:18 left, Canberra led by 53–46 with China in foul trouble and the Capitals sitting there with four.  Four seconds later, Bibby drew a foul and was all smiles before going to the line.  Once there, she put her game face on and scored a pair of  free throws to put the Capitals up by 9. With  50.6 seconds left in the third, Cheng Feng fouled out and sent Bibby to the line again, where Bibby scored another pair of three throws.  Graf was yelling at her team to push down the court, and Hunt did, scoring 2 points to put her team ahead by 13. With 5 seconds left in the quarter, the Capitals turn the ball over and the quarter ends 59–46.Hunt, Bibby, Norwood, Ogoke and Cosier started the fourth for Canberra, while Ma Xueya, Sun Mengran, Jiamei, Shen Yi and Huang Hongpin started for China.  China continued to play zone defense in this quarter and their bench continued to support their on court players. With the Caps ahead 61–50, Graf yelled at Hunt to shoot, and Hunt did, making a 3-point shot. Later in the quarter, Hunt shot an airball and Brigitte Ardossi did a good job keeping in play, getting the ball back to Hunt who failed to score on the next shot.  Hunt would finish the half 2 of 4 from 2 point range. With 4:52 left in the game, China took a time out. On the bench, Xueya had her fingers buddy taped, despite not starting the game with her fingers that way.  Following the time out, Graf had to yell at Bibby several times.  On the next opportunity to bring subs in, Bibby was subbed out of the game. China kept trying to score 3 points but was unable to capitalise. By the time there was 2:09 left in the game, Hunt was trying to slow play down. When Hunt was subbed out, the game sped up again. With 24 seconds left, China scored a 3 pointer to bring the score to 75–64 where the score remained unchanged in the remaining time.The game ended with Jessica Bibby leading in scoring for her team with 16 total points, 1 point ahead of Norwood who had 15 and 2 points ahead of Hunt who had 14.  6 of Bibby's points came from a pair of 3-point shots in the second half.  The only other player for her team to score a 3 pointer was Hunt. Only Tessa Lavey, who played only 2 minutes and 12 seconds and the returning Alice Coddington who played 13 minutes and 56 seconds failed to score for the Capitals. Dombkins led her team in rebounding with 8, while newcomer Ogoke had 7.The Canberra Capitals regular season starts on October 5, with first home game to be played on October 20, which will be Lauren Jackson's first game with the team.Canberra, Australia — Last night the Canberra Capitals women's basketball team defeated Townsville Fire 76–68 in a bruising encounter at the AIS Arena.A small crowd of about 700 was on hand to watch the Capitals play. The Capitals had only won one of their last twelve games — though Canberra and Townsville have been the only teams to defeat Bendigo Spirit, the top side in the competition. The normally upbeat program guide advised that "a Capitals win tonight is not out of the question".Nicole Hunt, Jessica Bibby, Brigitte Ardossi, Michelle Cosier and Carly Wilson formed the starting line up. Ardossi returned after not playing last week due to a concussion. Mikaela Dombkins, who also did not play last week, was missing entirely this week, but Lauren Jackson was still on hand, mainly to sign autographs. Ardossi took a hard knock in the first minutes of the game. She went off, replaced by Samantha Norwood, but would soon return to the court. Several minutes passed without either side scoring. Wilson attempted, but missed, a three pointer, and Bibby had a shot that hit the ring. After a series of turnovers, the Fire put the first score on the board. Canberra's response came from Norwood, who drew a foul and scored a point from a free throw.The score went to 3–4 after Hunt scored a basket. She then took a rebound to return possession to Canberra. Bibby made a second attempt at a long shot, which missed, but Wilson scored. A few minutes later, Bibby tried another three point shot and again failed, but on the next play assisted Ardossi in tying the score at 9–9. By quarter time the Capitals were down 12–17.The five starters took to the court again in the second quarter. The Fire scored first. Ardossi attempted a long shot, which failed, but a turnover saw Cosier score, assisted by Hunt. A penalty gave the Capitals possession again soon after, and Alexandra Bunton scored with one second left on the shot clock. Wilson, substituting for Hunt as point guard, ran over the line with the ball. However, she lifted over the next few minutes, making a three pointer to take the score to 24–29, and then running past the opposition to take another great shot which sailed through the basket without touching the hoop to make it 26–29. The rest of the side now suddenly also found something extra. Hunt and Norwood teamed up to grab a quick score from a turnover, and Ardossi took a rebound at one end of the court and scored at the other. Another rebound from Ardossi saw Hunt score as the crowd counted down with the shot clock, to give the Capitals, who had been six points down a few minutes before, a four point lead 33–29. But in the last minutes of the half, the Fire scored twice more, and Bibby missed once more, so the scores were tied at half time, 33–33.After a half time cheerleading demonstration by the Canberra Sirens Cheerleaders, Hunt, Wilson, Norwood, Cosier and Argossi started in the third quarter. Argossi posted the first score, making it 35–33. A couple of rebounds by Cosier saw Ardossi take two more from the free throw line. The Fire then fought back to 37–36. The game still refused to fall into the usual to-and-from characteristic of basketball. Bibby missed a shot, Ardossi fell over dramatically, Hunt took the rebound, Wilson tried to get a long shot, and finally Bunton managed to score. A stumble by Hunt saw a Fire player attempting a lone run at the basket, only to be stopped by Wilson. Two Fire free throws later, the score was 39–38. Hunt took a long shot to make it 41–38, Bibby missed another one, and then Hunt got one single handed, bringing it to 43–41, of which Hunt had scored nine. Bibby, who had still not scored, was knocked down in a bone crunching collision with an opponent. It took some time before her Capitals team mates helped her up. The Fire player was not so lucky, and remained on the floor for several minutes. Bibby was replaced by Casey Samuels. Two baskets by the Fire tied the score again, but Hunt scored twice more before the three quarter time siren, making it 49–45.Hunt scored first for her side in the final quarter, bring the score to 51–47, of which she was responsible for 15. The Fire posted one in response, but a defensive error let Wilson stand on the free throw line and take an uncontested shot. Alice Coddington scored a three pointer, Samuels a two pointer, and Cosier another three pointer. The scoreboard now read 61–52. A second three pointer by Cosier soon made it 64–52. Following a controversial decision involving Ardossi for which the umpire was loudly booed, the Fire fought back to 66–62, but Hunt and Ardossi each scored to hold them at bay. There then followed a few minutes of farce as the game was halted due to a problem with the shot clock. Once this was fixed, played resumed, with Ardossi and Hunt competing for the highest score. The scoreboard read 76–68 at the final siren, leaving the Capitals with a hard-earned if unexpected win. The highest scorer was Hunt, with 21 points, closely followed by Ardossi with 20, Cosier with 10, and Wilson with 9. Samuels had 6, Norwood had 5, Coddington had 3 from a single shot, and Bunton had 2 from a shot in the third quarter. Bibby was left scoreless.     The Capitals now have games at Bendigo and Bulleen, before their final match of the year at the AIS Arena on February 15.Before a crowd of 575 on Saturday at Wembley Park in Box Hill, metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, W-League team Canberra United lost to the Melbourne Victory 0–3  in the team's first loss since January of last year.Two of the Victory's goals came in the first half, with Canadian import Jessica McDonald and English import Jessica Fishlock each scoring for the Victory. Enza Barilla scored the third unanswered goal for the Victory in the second half.Canberra went into the game with a depleted roster, with six players called away to participate in national team training, suspended or out because of injury, including team captain Ellie Brush, midfielder Sally Shipard, Michelle Heyman, goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold, striker Ashleigh Sykes, and winger Hayley Raso. Caitlin Munoz filled in as the team's captain in Brush's absence, while Sally Rojahn and Catherine Brown each had their first United start and Grace Gill earned her first start of the season.Victory coach Mike Mulvey is quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald following the game as saying, "It's a good win, there's no doubt about that, but it could have been a more emphatic victory. We put three in the back of the net, and it could easily have been double that." The win moved Melbourne up to second place on the ladder, and continued the team's dominance over Canberra who now have 1 win and 6 losses playing away in Victoria.United's loss was one of three upsets in the round, with the Sydney FC losing to the Perth Glory 1–3 and the Brisbane Roar FC W-League losing to the Western Sydney Wanderers FC 1–2.Later tonight, the team departs for Tokyo to compete in the International Women's Club Championship against some of the best women's club teams in the world including Japan's INAC Kobe Leonessa and NTV Beleza, and France's Olympique Lyonnais. Canberra's first game is against INAC Kobe Leonessa on Thursday.

However some say as many as a million turned out for the Gallic extravaganza; the party atmosphere aided by a turn in the weather, the sun coming out for the first time all summer.Run on the second anniversary of the 2005 terrorist attacks and at a time  of heightened security, policing was successfully discrete the most visible police presence, by way of their novelty being, 45 members of the Gendarme Nationale.Coming to England for the first time since 1994 fans new and old had the course of the day and the three hours of the trials to familiarise themselves with the French institution. The initial good natured cheering on of every rider, growing into real excitement as the shape of the race emerged. At the end of the day the standings were:On March 19, 2006, Candace Parker, the 6 foot, 4 inches (1.93 meters) tall Tennessee Lady Volunteers forward, made NCAA Basketball history and set a record as the first woman ever to double dunk in an NCAA game.  The media buzz is that Parker has taken women's basketball up to a new level... the air.During a Women's NCAA Championship game against the Army Black Knights, Parker made her first dunk of the game with 13:44 left in the first half. The Lady Vols were ahead, 14-13, as Sidney Spencer fed the ball to Parker, who flew over opponents to the net, becoming the first woman to slam dunk in an NCAA game.  The crowd roared... not once, but twice.  With 14:18 left in the second half, Parker took Nicky Anosike's pass and soared above Army and Lady Vol players.  Parker palmed the ball and stuffed it through the rim for her second slam dunk in the game.  Even the famously focused Coach Pat Summit took a moment to appreciate the feat.  During an NPR interview, sports analyst, Nancy Lieberman, spoke about what Parker's dunking foreshadows for women's basketball.  Both Lieberman and Summit noted that Parker frequently dunks the ball during practice, as other women do.  Lieberman says that women's basketball has developed immensely in recent years.  And she expects audiences will see women NCAA and professional basketball players use dunking and other spectacular skills much more in the future.Most people are celebrating Parker's double dunk as a success.  In both women's and men's basketball, a few have questioned whether dunking makes the game better.  But, adding a dunk shot will certainly change the game, as will the continued development of point guards.  Basketball analysts usually agree that dunking is exciting and most say that using this high-percentage shot will draw bigger audiences to women's hoops.Mount Stromlo, Canberra — Earlier today, Capital Punishment, the Canberra based 50km and 100km mountain bike race, was unofficially won by Shaun Lewis in the 100km distance in about four hours. Official results are set to be announced tomorrow at cyclenation.com.au because of a minor computer glitch. In a parallel youth competition run as part of the event, Zoe Cuthbert won the girls 10 and 11 year old three lap event.Last year's event was marred by rain, but this year the weather was ideal with no precipitation. First time on site, paramedics Theodora Magar and Chris Runcher reported no serious injuries, only a few minor cuts and bruises with the exception of one dislocated collar bone. They were backed up by other medical personnel located on the course. Events started at 7:00 a.m. at Sparrow Hill for the 100km race and and on through Canberra's downtown where the 50km started before going to the Black Mountain Reserve and the National Arboretum and ending at Mount Stromlo.Capital Punishment was part of a series of seven races organized by CycleNation which between 6,000 and 8,000 total riders participated in. There were a variety of cyclists of different skill levels including former Australian national team members, casual cyclists like Michael Courtney and Tracey Kloos alongside youth cyclists like Zoe Cuthbert. 40 year old Courtney traveled from Sydney to ride, finishing the 50km race in about 4 hours, 30 minutes but not setting a personal best. He enjoys riding in Canberra and finds the pain of going up the hills worth the ride down. Kloos also participated in the 50km race as a member of the 20 strong Newcastle women's based club, Newy Cogheads's Team Torque Talk. In her second time in the race, she did not set a personal best.Of the youth event, Cuthbert's father Paul said his first place finishing daughter regularly participated in mountain biking events, with the sport being her primary one though she does play netball casually. The eleven year old was celebrating her birthday on race day.Organizer Theo Grobler said most cyclists would be done by 3:00 p.m. Canberra Time (5:00 UTC) and that some would need the eight hours to complete the 100km course.Another 50km and 100km race, the Convict 100, will be held in Australia in the Sydney area next weekend on Saturday with a start time of 6:00 a.m. Sydney Time (20:00 UTC).The inaugural CAR (Confederation of African Rugby) women's rugby 7's tournament was held in Kampala, Uganda on the 24th June 2006.  Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia and Zimbabwe arrived in Uganda while South Africa jetted in on Friday evening.  Uganda fielded two teams – Lady Cranes and a select Uganda side to replace the Nigerians who had pulled out of the tournament.  The games kicked off at 10:00am with great weather and apart from mid morning drizzle which quickly cleared up, it was a perfect day for 7's rugby.  Tournament top seeds South Africa started on the right note when they had a comfortable 26 - 00 win against 5th seeded Zambia.  Looking decidedly rusty in the game against their southern sisters, South Africa however steadily improved as the tournament progressed.  Their disciplined defence, ball handling skills and excellent team work made them stand out and it was clear that this was the team to beat.  South Africa beat a gritty Uganda Select side 22 – 05 and finished off their preliminary games with a 14 – 00 win over 4th seeds Kenya leaving them top of Pool A.Kenya, whose men's 7's side are a regular inclusion in the IRB 7's circuit, also had comfortable wins over Uganda Select and Zambia beating them 33 – 00 and 22 – 00 to finish 2nd in Pool A.  Zambia's only win in the group stages was against Uganda Select whom they beat 21 – 00.  Zambia and Uganda Select were 3rd and 4tth respectively in Pool A.Pool B had second seeds Lady Cranes (Uganda) outplaying 3rd seeds Zimbabwe and Burundi.  The Lady Cranes were determined to keep their unbeaten record and showed themselves a cut above the other teams in their pool in terms of pace and superior ball handling skills.  Burundi was thrashed 56 – 00 while Zimbabwe were eclipsed by a similar margin of 54 – 00.  Rwanda almost threatened to upset the East African queens and made the Ugandans work for a 24 – 05 victory.  Rwanda is the fastest improving team in East Africa and showed their intent when they comfortably beat Zimbabwe 25 – 00 and hammered their hapless neighbours, Burundi, 41 – 00.  Zimbabwe beat Burundi 15 – 00 in a scrappy game that highlighted the large gap between the two sides and the other teams in this tournament.  Although Zimbabwe had the requisite skills they were unpolished and unfit while the Burundians had a very young enthusiastic squad who are yet to master the basics of the game.  Lady Cranes topped Pool A, Rwanda was 2nd with Zimbabwe and Burundi 3rd and 4th respectively.  The first Plate trophy semi final matched Zambia against Burundi.  Zambia easily disposed of the East Africans in one sided affair and humiliated Burundi 55 – 00.  The second semi final was slightly more competitive and once again against pitted Southern Africa against East Africa.  Uganda Select won their second game of the tournament when they beat Zimbabwe 22 – 00 to join Zambia in the Plate final.  The 1st Main Cup semi final was another one sided match with South Africa running all over the tired Rwandese to win 46 – 00.  Rwanda paid the price of depending solely on one player (teenage sensation Angelique Nzabamita) to win their games as the speedy winger was too fatigued at this stage to make any impact as she had been doing in the earlier games.  There was a small consolation for Rwanda at the end of the tournament as Angelique Nzabamita was awarded the Top Try Scorers trophy.The most exciting game of the tournament was perhaps the 2nd Main Cup semi final that was between arch rivals Uganda and Kenya.  Ugandan fans expected the lighter, fleet footed Ugandans to run rings around their East African neighbours as they had done so frequently in the past.  Those expectations were almost fulfilled when Uganda outpaced the Kenyans to score 2 tries (one of them a penalty try) in the first half and converted one to lead 12 – 00.   Apart from Zimbabwe, the Kenyans were perhaps the heaviest girls in the tournament but their fitness was several notches above that of the southerners and they had pace and determination to go with it.  The Kenyans recovered and sped their way to two tries one of which was converted to level the game at 12 -12 just before half time.  After the half time break, Lady Cranes sought to put an end to the tension and went ahead with a try that was not converted.  Kenya however dug their heels in and Doreen Remour, who was outstanding throughout the tournament for the Kenyans, equalised taking the game into sudden death extra time.  Although exhausted both teams put up an excellent display of rugby, neither ready to give way to the other with the first half of extra time ending after 3 minutes with the teams still deadlocked at 17 – 17.  In the second half, Sauda Adiru broke through a valiant Kenyan defence to score a try for the Lady Cranes and put an end to Kenya's hopes.The Plate Final had Zambia taking on Uganda Select.  The Ugandan second side had done very well to get this far and was eager to avenge their earlier loss to Zambia in the preliminary games.  However, Zambia had been improving steadily with each game and was determined to take some silverware home.  They were faster and more aggressive than the Ugandans and thumped them 33 – 00 to lift the Plate trophy.The Main Cup Final was the game all the fans had been waiting to see:  the Southern African queens versus the East African queens.  The two teams were evenly matched for speed but the South Africans had superior ball skills, fluid teamwork and a tighter defence pattern.  The first half was a tightly contested 10 minutes with South Africa drawing first blood with a try that they were unable to convert.  Uganda responded with a well worked try and converted to give themselves a slim 2 point lead at half time.   However, after half time, South Africa's well marshalled defence kept out the Ugandan speedsters and on attack they displayed slick moves that split open the Uganda defence to  let them through for 2 more unconverted tries (one of them a penalty try) to win the game 15 – 07 and become the African 7's champions.  The tournament's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award deservedly went to Charmaine Keyser from South Africa who dazzled players and spectators alike with her speed and great all round rugby skills.  All in all, it was a historic day filled with fantastic rugby and a large step forward for women's rugby in Africa.   Hopefully further editions of the CAR 7's will include teams from Western and Northern Africa.  With the 2009 IRB 7's Rugby World Cup including a women's competition, then this is definitely a step in the right direction.The Carling Cup tie between Leicester City and Nottingham Forest was abandoned at half time after Leicester defender Clive Clarke collapsed in the changing room at half time.Shortly after the half time whistle, paramedics were called into the changing room before taking Clarke to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham.Tim Davies, Leicester City's chief executive said: "He was taken away in an ambulance to hospital.

Marco Simoncelli and Ben Spies also failed to finish the race after suffering crashes. The race was affected by bad driving conditions due to heavy rain but a large crowd still attended despite no British riders taking part in the MotoGP.Speaking to the BBC after his victory Stoner said "At the beginning we didn't get a great start. But the bike felt good, and I waited for the tyres to get up to temperature. In the first lap I had water in my visor, so for the first five or six laps I couldn't really see properly. I couldn't see any puddles. But finally the water went away and I was able to do the lap times I wanted, and open up a gap."German riders Stefan Bradl and Jonas Folger won the Moto2 and 125cc classification races.Australian rider Casey Stoner has won the 2011 Catalunya MotoGP, marking his third win of the season. The victory moves him closer to championship leader Jorge Lorenzo, who placed second in the race. American Ben Spies came in third, while Marco Simoncelli—who had the pole position—suffered a bad start and finished in sixth.Stoner, who led for the majority of the race, said, "Jorge got off to a good start and I had to wait until the end of the first lap to overtake him and then he couldn't stay with me, fortunately." Catalunya is the fifth race of the 2011 season; current standings have Lorenzo leading with 98 points and Stoner only seven points behind.Lorenzo commented on the result, saying, "It was really tough to fight with Casey—I tried to live with him as many laps as possible, but my rear tyre was sliding, so second place is good for us."Fifteen riders started the race but this was brought down to only thirteen after Japanese rider Hiroshi Aoyama collided with Randy de Puniet during the competition, taking down both riders. Neither of the men were injured in the accident and Aoyama apologised to de Puniet after the race.Cédric Vasseur of France has won stage 10 of the 2007 Tour de France. Vasseur won a five man sprint to the finishline by the slimmest of margins."This morning I was on the phone to a friend and he told me, ‘Today is your day!’ And in all honesty I had the same confidence about this long stage. The victory had to be mine," said Vasseur after his victory.Michael Rasmussen of Denmark retains the overall lead, finishing the stage some 10 minutes later with the peleton. In fact, all of the top ten in the overall, finished with the same time, leaving the standings unchanged from yesterday."It was a long, hard day and all the guys are suffering in the heat, that’s quite obvious and 230 kilometers into a headwind takes its toll on everybody. My Rabobank team defended well today and we’ll have to wait and see how we go. There is another two days before we have the big test in the time trial on Saturday and then I’ll start thinking about the Pyrenees," said Michael Rasmussen.He went on to say that he is now the leader of the Rabobank team: "There’s been a lot said about the situation regarding leadership between myself and Denis Menchov and I think it’s quite clear now that I’m the leader in the team now and I’m here to defend the yellow jersey for as long as possible."Patrik Sinkewitz of Germany, who has already dropped out of the Tour after a crash, got more bad news when the A sample in a drug test on June 8, came back positve.In the Scottish Premier League, Celtic Football Club have defeated Aberdeen Football Club 9 - 0.

Celtic have won the league title for the sixth consecutive season.Having only dropped four points all season, Celtic claimed victory thanks to a hat-trick from striker Scott Sinclair and a goal each from Patrick Roberts and Stuart Armstrong. Upon claiming the league title, club manager Brendan Rodgers said, "I'm absolutely delighted for the players and everyone connected with the club, I'm really proud of the professionalism, the integrity, the pride and the style with which the team have played. This is what we wanted to create."For Rodgers, Celtic's triumph marks his first league title as a manager, having narrowly missed out on the Premier League trophy with Liverpool F.C. in 2014. Speaking on the club's success, he said, "I couldn't think of a better place for me to be at this stage of my life", "It's only the beginning of the cycle. It's exciting to see the growth, the development."Celtic secured the title with eight matches still to be played and without losing a match. Should the club manage to extend their unbeaten through to the end of the season it would be the first time in the club's history the feat has been achieved in a 38-match campaign. Celtic have a potential chance to complete a first domestic treble since 2001, having already won the Scottish League Cup and having qualified for the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup later in April.Even with six players in double figures, the Boston Celtics fell to the Detroit Pistons 109-102 on Tuesday night. The loss extends the franchise-record losing streak of the Celtics to 15 games.The Celtics could not keep up with the Pistons during the game, falling behind 16 points at halftime and 22 points after three periods. A rally by the Celtics in the fourth period gave Boston a glimmer of hope but Detroit's starters returned to hold off the Celtics.Pistons coach Flip Saunders was not pleased by the effort his team gave in the fourth quarter. "Your main guys should have the opportunity to sit down and ice in the fourth quarter of a game like that," he said. "We had to bring those guys back with five minutes left to make sure we won the thing." A 16-2 run by the Celtics midway through the final quarter brought the team back to within 10 points of the Pistons, but the Detroit starters returned after a timeout to quash the burgeoning Celtics rally.Doc Rivers, Celtics coach, was less enthused by his team's late run."I'm not going to put a lot of stock in that. I'm not sure how much the other team was still competing at that point." Adding to the team's woes was the news that star Paul Pierce was sent home by team doctors with an infection in his left elbow. This latest development will push Pierce's return to the lineup beyond the All-Star break. Pierce has missed the last 23 games with a foot injury.While the Celtics trailed by only 5 points after one quarter, the Pistons shot 72% from the field in the second quarter, led by Antonio McDyess with 10 points. Rivers attributed the problem to the team's bench play. "The bench really put us in a hole in the second quarter - it was a five-point game when they went in there."The Pistons are next at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday, while the Celtics return home to face the Miami Heat this evening.Central Michigan University senior quarterback Dan LeFevour has become the all-time leader in passing yardage in Mid-American Conference history.

The last time a Currie Cup final ended in a draw was in the 1989 season. The game was played in front of a packed Vodacom Park, with all tickets being sold out on the first day.The final was the first in Bloemfontein since the 1994 season at Springbok Park, where Transvaal defeated the Free State team. The 2006 final is the third in succession which features both the Blue Bulls and Cheetahs, with the teams being the finalists since the 2004 season. The Blue Bulls won the 2004 final at Loftus Versfeld, and then in 2005 the Cheetahs defeated them at Loftus in the final. The 2006 season kicked off in June, with the regular season finishing after 14 rounds in late September. The Cheetahs finished in first place on the season table, with the Blue Bulls behind them in second place. The Blue Bulls defeated Western Province in the semi finals, with the Cheetahs defeating the Sharks to win theirs to set up the final.The scoring opened up in the third minute with a penalty kick to the Cheetahs through Willem de Waal. Successful with the kick, the Cheetahs opened up a three point lead over the Bulls.

Currently, German company Adidas made the kits for The Blues, a deal worth £30 million annually. Chelsea's contract with Adidas runs till 2023. Chelsea is obliged to pay about £40 million to the German firm. Chelsea's termination of Adidas's contract was announced in May.Per the contract with the US company, Chelsea would receive a reported sum of £60 million each year. Announcing a long term contract, Nike Brand president Trevor Edwards said, "The partnership with Chelsea reinforces our leadership position in football. We are excited to help grow the club's global reach, serving players and supporters with Nike innovation and design."Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia, for the team's part, said, "This is an incredibly exciting and important deal for the club."Chelsea won the Premier League in 2014–15 under Portuguese manager José Mourinho but they finished tenth last season. Adidas and Spanish club Real Madrid signed a ten year contract earlier this year and the German sports brand sponsors other football giants like FC Bayern München, Juventus F.C., A.C. Milan, and Manchester United F.C.A heated showdown occurred in the all London Carling Cup final yesterday at Millennium Stadium.  Chelsea fielded a full strength side, including Andriy Shevchenko, Michael Ballack, Didier Drogba, and skipper John Terry.  Arsenal on the other hand fielded a young side, including Theo Walcott, Cesc Fabregas, Jeremie Aliadiere, and Justin Hoyte.Despite their apparent lack of experience, Arsenal started out the match strongly, with crisp passing and great control.  They pressed their advantage, and forced Chelsea keeper Petr Cech into several saves.  On 12 minutes, Theo Walcott struck gold, as he orcestrated a give and go with Abou Diaby and slotted the ball into the far corner of the net, scoring his first ever goal for the Gunners.  Soon after, Baptista of Arsenal had a legitimate claim for a penalty, but referee Howard Webb wouldn't hear of it.  Chelsea struck back quickly, and a hint of offside was shown as Didier Drogba was played in by an over the top ball by Michael Ballack.  The Ivory Coast striker didn't wait for a whistle, and slotted the ball between Manuel Almunia's legs to tie the match.  A few more chances were spurned due to poor finishing before the break, but the game went into halftime drawn at one a piece.The second half started much as the first, with the youthful exuberance of Arsenal showing through, as they continued to press.  Chelsea's output was increased as well however, with the addition of Arjen Robben at the exspense of Makelele. 2 yellow cards were handed out to Chelsea in the next few minutes, before the game took a huge downturn.  Chelsea skipper John Terry was seriously injured, when Diaby's foot connected squarly with his face as Diaby attempted to clear the ball.  Terry was taken off in a stretcher and was replaced by Mikel.  The loss of their captain seemed to push Chelsea to new levels, as Drogba forced a fine save out of Almunia, and Lampard saw his shot go off the woodwork.  Arsenal were not able to hold on, and on 81 minutes, Denilson made a sloppy pass and Robben picked up the scraps.  He sent a cross in as Drogba beat Senderos to the ball and headed in his 28th of the campaign.  The blue tide continued, and Shevchenko blasted a ball off the woodwork, missing his chance to seal the victory.As the game entered stoppage time, Mikel and Toure entered a shoving match, and more players got involved.  Coaches took the field to attempt to settle their players, and when all was finally calm, Mikel and Toure were shown red cards, along with Adebayor of Arsenal.  The game was finally called at 101 minutes, and stand in skipper Lampard was able to hoist the Carling Cup.Chelsea survived a Champions League scare today after coming back from 1-0 down to defeat Portuguese side Porto at Stamford Bridge in London.  The first leg of the match ended 1-1, giving Chelsea the advantage thanks to the away goals rule, and Porto needed a win or a draw of 2 all or higher to advance to the next round.  Porto fielded a defensive side, leaving Portuguese international striker Helder Postiga out of the starting lineup, while Chelsea featured Andriy Shevchenko and Didier Drogba on attack.Shevchenko almost opened the scoring early in the game, having a poweful shot from 20 yard fly just over the bar and out of play.  The early attack did little to inspire Chelsea though, as they looked sluggish for the first parts of the game.  Porto took advantage of Chelsea's poor start, and scored in the 15th minute on a counter attack.  Lopez quickly passed the ball up to Gonzales in the center of the pitch, who split the defence with a well aimed ball that released Quaresma on a break away.  The Portuguese player made no mistake about his shot, and slid it neatly past Petr Cech to give the visiting team the lead.  Chelsea vainly attempted to draw level, but none of their first half chances were able to find the target to trouble keeper da Helton.  Chelsea had a claim for a penalty nearing 35 minutes when Arjen Robben after he was apparently tripped up by Raul Moreiles, but the Dutch midfielded was awarded a yellow card instead for his theatrical dive.  Chelsea's defence supplied the most attack for the English Champions, as Ashley Cole made a fine cross into the box which was poorly cleared by Ricardo Costa, and the Ball broke for Michael Ballack.  Costa was quick to justify his mistake and he poked the ball away from Ballack before he could get a shot away.  The biggest worry for Porto came when Jorge Fucile was struck in the face by the trailing arm off a teammate, and left the field with blood streaming from his nose.The second half saw Fucile retake the pitch, his injury obviously not too serious.  Chelsea made a change to start the second half, adding John Obi Mikel in place of Claude Makelele.  It took Chelsea only 3 minutes after the restart to get back into the match, and the goal came through Arjen Robben.  The Dutchman cleaved a shot from 25 yards, and even though it lack power, de Helton was not able to get a grip on it and the ball slipped past him into the net.  The goal tied not only the game, but also the series, and the scoreline would force extra time.  Chelsea wouldn't allow the game to get that far though, and Ashley Cole, Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack all contributed to the winning goal.  A cross by Cole was headed down by Shevy, and neatly volleyed into the net by the German Ballack.  Porto pressed, but the Chelsea defence easily coped, and Chelsea advanded to next round of the Champions League.In England, John Terry, captain of the Chelsea football team, has been found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence. Terry had been accused of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers (QPR) defender Anton Ferdinand, another football player, as a match between Chelsea and QPR was in progress. Terry, who had said he was "angry and upset" about the allegations, was alleged to have said the words "fucking black cunt" in an insulting manner to Ferdinand. During the trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Terry stated he had been repeating words Ferdinand had accused him of saying.Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said that although there was "no doubt that John Terry uttered the words 'fucking black cunt' at Anton Ferdinand", the evidence for the prosecution's side was "not strong" and there was a possibility "that what [Terry] said was not intended as an insult, but rather as a challenge to what he believed had been said to him." Therefore, "[i]n those circumstances, there being a doubt, the only verdict the court can record is one of not guilty", Riddle concluded.Although Terry refused to make any comment as he departed from the court, some Chelsea F.C. supporters cheered him. Both of Ferdinand's parents also refused to comment, with his father Julian saying only: "I have nothing to say to you at all." As the verdict was declared, there was cheering in the court's public gallery.Speaking outside the courtroom, Dan Morrison — John Terry's lawyer — stated Terry "consistently explained his position to the FA, the police and to the court." Terry "did not racially abuse Mr Ferdinand and the court has accepted this", Morrison said. Bruce Buck, the Chairman of Chelsea F.C., commented: "We are pleased that John can now put his mind back to football, return to training and do what he has been doing for many years."Alison Saunders, London Chief Crown Prosecutor, justified the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to take this case to court by saying "[t]he very serious allegation at the heart of this case was one of racial abuse." The CPS believed "this was not 'banter' on the football pitch and that the allegation should be judged by a court", Saunders clarified. She called Terry's not guilty verdict "justice being done and we respect the chief magistrate's decision."A spokesperson for the Football Association (FA) said the association "notes the decision in the John Terry case and will now seek to conclude its own inquiries". The FA intends to resume its inquiry into the events next week.Second place Chelsea visited Fratton Park earlier today to take on Portsmouth, who currently reside in eighth position in the league.  Chelsea, who watched Manchester United defeat Liverpool earlier in the day, were 12 points behind the leaders and needed a win to ensure a tight race until the end of the season.  Chelsea skipper {{w|John Terry remained out of the squad after his injury in the Carling Cup final against Arsenal, and Frank Lampard again filled the void as captain.Portsmouth were the first to threaten goal, as Lua Lua blasted a right footed shot at the Chelsea goal, but keeper Petr Cech was able to make a save to avoid falling behind early.  Chelsea soon began to dominate possession, but shots by Ashley Cole and Andriy Shevchenko were sent wide and high of the goal.  Shevchenko then tried to become provider, as he swept in a ball for Drogba, but the ensuing shot was off target.  Drogba soon made amends, as he knocked in a goal from a deep cross by Ashley Cole.  The goal was Drogba's 29th of the season in all competitions.After the halftime break, Chelsea continued to threaten, and Arjen Robben could have doubled the lead, but his shot hit off the goal post instead.  The next goal attempt was a 25 yard shot by Frank Lampard, which keeper David James did well to hold on to.  On 57 minutes, Arjen Robben made a run down the sideline and was brought down by a strong challenge.  He then appeared to have been struck by an object thrown from the audience, and was booed by the crowd for the rest of the game.  Portsmouth nearly stole points from Chelsea minutes later, when substitute Andy Cole headed towards goal, but Cech again was in the right place to see off the danger.  With the clock winding down, Chelsea killed off the game when Kalou took advantage of a mistake by James, and slotted the ball into the back of the net.The win leaves Chelsea still in the running for their third consecutive Premier League title, but their more immediate concerns are their second leg Champions League match against Porto this Tuesday.  Portsmouth have only the Premier League to contend with now, and play Reading next at the Madejski Stadium next Saturday.Today, London-based football club Chelsea F.C. sacked José Mourinho from the position of the club's manager.Chelsea, the last years' Premier League champions, have sixteenth position in the league table and very poor performance this season, winning just four games out of sixteen in 2015-2016's season. The Portuguese Mourinho has managed the club for seven seasons, in two spells, won the Premier League thrice, FA Community Shield and FA Cup once.Chelsea, battling relegation, won only fifteen points and are 20 points behind Leicester City.  Mourinho signed a four-year contract in August. Mourinho's last game as Chelsea's manager was played against Leicester City, in which his side lost 2–1.Chelsea, on the club's website released a statement, saying that José and the board agreed this performance was not good and both sides agreed to the move. The statement also said José would still be a much loved figure at Stamford Bridge, and described him as "the most successful manager in our 110-year history."Previously, when José was sacked after winning two titles, he won the Champions League with Inter and La Liga with Real Madrid. Before his first signing for Chelsea, he won the Champions League with FC Porto.Michael Essien will sign a contract worth £26 million (US$47 million, €38 million) with the London football club Chelsea.  The record-breaking offer from Chelsea was accepted by the French club Lyon on Monday.  Several of Chelsea's previous offers were rejected.  Essien, the 22-year old Ghanian midlfielder, did not sign the 5-year contract on Tuesday as planned, because Lyon delayed sending the necessary forms to complete the transfer.  Lyon will receive Chelsea player Tiago along with the payment worth one third of Lyon's budget.Essien will likely now arrive in London on Wednesday or Thursday for his medical.Bernard Lacombe, a Lyon representative, describes playing in England as Essien's "dream".  Lyon president Jean-Michael Aulas characterizes the loss of Essien as "a wrench but for the club this is a good deal".Premiership title hopefuls Chelsea were forced to battle back for a draw earlier today at Stamford Bridge.  Tottenham seemed to have a spot in the semifinals of the FA Cup all wrapped up before two late strikes from Lampard and Kalou ruined the day for Spurs.  Chelsea were again without the heart of their defence, John Terry, and it showed for much of the game as Tottenham broke through the Blues lines far too easily on several occasions.  Chelsea came out to win though, and nearly all their main stars were on the pitch to start the match, including Shevchenko, Ballack, Drogba, and Lampard.  Martin Jol's Tottenham also fielded a strong attacking side, even without the use of the injured Robbie Keane.  Defoe, Berbatov, and Lennon lead the way for Spurs instead, with Canadian Paul Stalteri and Englishman Michael Dawson on defence.  Tottenham also had to use their backup keeper Radek Cerny, as their number one Paul Robinson is with Keane on the injured list.Tottenham came out fast and hard, scoring after only 5 minutes.  Jermain Defoe cut in from the left and attempted a pass to Hossam Ghaly, but Aaron Lennon pick up the ball instead and sent it in to the Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov.  Chelsea keeper Petr Cech sprinted out in an attempt to block, but Berbatov spun and volleyed the ball high into the back of the net, giving the visitors the early lead.  Tottenham pressed for a second, and two chances presented themselves to Defoe and Lennon, but the crossesfrom Berbatov and Defoe were out of the players reaches.  Chelsea would strike back though, and the goal would be against the run of play.  Ballack received a chested down ball from Shevchenko after a Drogba cross, and the German blasted the ball low and hard.  The shot was off target, but Frank Lampard was able to react quickly enough to fling out his leg and deflect the ball into the back of the net.  Tottenham continued to run at the shaky Chelsea defence, and were rewarded with a goal when Aaron Lennons seemingly harmless cross was knock into Chelsea's net by Michael Essien, who was attempting to cover back on defence.  Tottenham then nearly gave Chelsea an own goal of their own as Michael Dawson knocked Arjen Robbens cross toward his own net, but Paul Stalteri raced back to clear off the line.  After the near tying goal, Jose Mourinho made an early change by replacing Paulo Ferreira with Shaun Wright-Phillips.  Another defensive error would see Chelsea two behind soon after though, as Ghaly beat three defenders to a high ball, and slotted the ball past Cech from 12 yards out.  Chelsea had a few more chances as they tried to grab a lifeline before the break, but nothing truly troubled keeper Cerny.Chelsea came out of the dressing room much more positively after the break, and had 3 chances to score from 2 Ballack free kicks, and a well taken shot by Lampard. Cerny did well to keep the game at 3-1 however.  Spurs nearly put the game away on the counter attack, but Cech came out quick to stop Aaron Lennons run, and Defoe could not find the net after the ensuing cross by Ghaly.  Chelsea then made 2 changes in just over 5 minutes, as Boulahrouz and Kalou took to the pitch.  On the 70th minute, Chelsea earned a corner, and Arjen Robben stepped up to take the set piece.  A goulmouth scramble occurred from the curving corner and the ball landed nicely at Lampard's feet.  The Enlgishman blasted it home, cutting the deficit to one.  Chelsea equliazed 4 minutes from time through substitute Salomon Kalou.  Didier Drogba headed the ball to his fellow countryman Kalou, and the Ivorian volleyed the ball into the back of the net.  Jermain Defoe had a chance to be the hero for Tottenham only minutes later as he beat out three defenders and struck the ball hard past Cech, but not past the crossbar.  The game ended drawn, and the replay will be held at White Hart Lane on March 19th.Today, a controversial decision was taken by referee Chris Foy in a recent match between Sunderland Association Football Club and Chelsea Football Club in the U.K. to send off Chelsea's Robben after "excessive celebrations". The decision was taken after Robben proceeded to embrace fans beyond the barriers of the club, which was seen by the referee to be a breach of safety regulations, as well as FIFA policy.As consensus, ex-match officials watching the game agreed the decision was thought to lack common sense. However, the policy of restricting player celebrations was introduced into FIFA policy last year after safety concerns from various match officials. FIFA rules state several situations in which celebrations may lead to booking;If, In the opinion of the referee, a player makes gestures which are provocative, derisory or inflammatory.If the player climbs on to a perimeter fence to celebrate a goal being scored.If the player removes his shirt over his head or covers his head with his shirt.However, the rule which BSkyB stated in the pre match commentary was more relevant, because the aforementioned rules were not in any way broken; referring to the fact that perimeter fences were only common in Spanish football. The guideline stated that "leaving the field to celebrate a goal is not a cautionable offense in itself but it is essential that players return to the field as soon as possible".Despite the justification of the referee's call, both Robben himself, and commentator Andy Gray questioned the common sense nature of the decision, noting that quick thinking and spontaneous decision should be something a referee focuses on, rather than the implicit enforcement of minor rules.In response to the decision, Andy Gray noted;"I can't believe it, celebration is a natural thing to do.. all he was doing was simply celebrating after a job well done with his fans. It wasn't like he was actually inciting fans because it was his own side. This really is the most silly call I have ever seen a referee make in my history of commentating."Today, Chennai-based football club Chennaiyin FC defeated FC Goa 3–2 at Fatorda Stadium in Margao in the Indian Super League final.The match saw five yellow cards, two for the home side. Chennai's Mehrajuddin Wadoo was the first one to be booked in the 18th minute. In the 33rd minute, Goa's Moura's shot was deflected by Wadoo. With a single booking, the first half ended 0–0.In the second half, in the 53rd minute, Pronay Halder committed a foul on Chennai's Stiven Mendoza in the penalty area, and the visitors were awarded a penalty kick. Stepping forward for the kick, Bruno Pelissari's kick was saved by Laxmikant Kattimani but the ball bounced back, and Pelissari made no mistake, scoring. Chennai got a 1–0 lead.Thoi Singh was booked in the 57th minute. Halder, in the 58th minute, assisted Thongkhosiem Haokip and the Indian footballer scored an equaliser for the home side. Grégory Arnolin received a yellow card in the 60th minute for protesting the referee's decision. Chennai was awarded another penalty kick. Stiven Mendoza stood up for the penalty, but missed.Table-turning events took place in the dying moments of the game. Jofre scored a goal in the 87th minute. A minute later, he was yellow-carded; but, Goa had a 2–1 lead. Goa's goalie Laxmikant Kattimani scored an own goal for a 2–2 equaliser and in the additional time, Mendoza netted a goal assisted by Jayesh Rane. Next minute, Mendoza was yellow-carded, but the final whistle blew a few moments later, and Chennaiyin FC won the second edition of the Indian Super League in the 3–2 goal tally.Russian chess grandmaster, Vladimir Kramnik lost the final match of his man versus machine match against the Deep Fritz chess program.  The six game match in Bonn, Germany had a final result of 4-2 for the German-developed chess program which runs on readily available computer hardware.The first match which concluded on November 25 was a draw, Kramnik lost the second game to the computer with some indications that he overlooked a mate in one win.  Third through fifth matches were all draws.Kramnik, whilst the current world chess champion, is actually ranked third in the world.  A contributory factor in this is his health problems.  The world champion suffers from a rare form of arthritis which makes sitting playing in tournaments extremely painful for him.Anatoly Karpov and Gary Kasparov, two former chess world champions, are playing a twelve-game match against each other in Valencia, Spain, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the first world championship match between the two.As of Wednesday, two of the twelve games had been completed. Kasparov had won both games, which were held at a "rapid" time control, 25 minutes per player per game, with three seconds added after each move."I didn't know whether my instincts would work," said Kasparov after winning the first two games.Kasparov, 46, is said to have an advantage over Karpov, 58, due to his younger age. Kasparov, however, said, "I wouldn't make any predictions yet [on the outcome of the match]. Karpov was and still is a great opponent. I have to find out whether I will be able to keep my calm."The games are estimated to have been watched by up to ten million chess fans on the internet. The website hosting the games temporarily had to shut down due to high traffic.In 1984, Karpov and Kasparov played for the world championship title in what would become an iconic match. Karpov was defending his title against the challenger, Kasparov. The match was suspended after five months and 48 games, as neither player was able to gain enough of a lead to determine a clear winner.Former world chess champion Bobby Fischer will move from Japan to his new home of Iceland despite requests from the USA for his deportation to the US. Mr Fischer had been held in Japan since last July when he was arrested on what US officials claimed was an invalid US passport.  He was freed from detention on March 23 after 9 months in confinement.Mr Fischer is wanted in the USA for violating Executive Order 12810, signed by then-President George H. W. Bush in 1992.  EO 12810 placed sanctions on the former Yugoslavia, where Mr Fischer played a chess match in 1992 against Boris Spassky.  If Mr Fischer had been sent to the US, he would have faced a ten year prison term.  The U.S. revoked his passport in 2003 and Mr Fischer was later arrested at Narita Airport while trying to leave Japan en route to the Philippines.Following an appeal by Mr Fischer's supporters, the parliament of Iceland granted Mr Fischer an Icelandic passport on Monday. Mr Fischer won the world championship in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1972, against Mr Spassky, then of the Soviet Union, and Mr Fischer remains popular among Icelanders.  (Mr Spassky became a French citizen in 1978).  The 1992 rematch was billed as as being for the "World Championship", although by then most chess fans recognized Garry Kasparov as the world's #1 player.Iceland's ambassador to Japan, Thordur Oskarsson, said that the US government had sent a message of displeasure to the Icelandic government before its parliament passed the bill allowing for Mr Fischer's citizenship. Mr Oskarsson went on to say that, "Despite the message, the decision was put through Parliament on humanitarian grounds".On Sunday, R Praggnanandhaa became the youngest Indian chess player to earn the title of Grand Master.

Wilson was the 236th pick overall.Wilson comes to the Bears organization following a tumultuous final season of university football.  He quit his team after nine games following abuse accusations he made against Washington State's head coach Mike Leach.  In talking with the Chicago Tribune, he said "I feel like I could have handled it a little better but like I said I am just moving forward [...] I am excited about the opportunity I have at hand."Chicago Bears head coach Marc Trestman said regarding Wilson's selection, "I would consider it a young guy making a very, very small mistake that put him in a position that got him in trouble. [...] I think that like any young guy, I am a parent, we’re parents here. Our kids have made mistakes along the way. He’s a good kid with a big upside. He’s come to the right place. He’s come to a locker room where we have players and coaches that will set him straight right from the beginning and get him going the right direction. It’s an exciting opportunity for us to grow a young man, to allow him to mature off the field as well as on it and the upside as a talent, we’re very excited about it."The 20-year-old draft pick's university highlights included playing in 33 games with 27 starts, where he had 189 receptions for 3,207 yards for an average of 17 yards per catch.  He also had 23 touchdowns. As a sophomore, he made 82 receptions that he converted into  1,388 yards and 12 touchdowns.The team was able to pick Wilson because they traded their 20th selection pick in the fifth round to the Atlanta Falcons for a 30th round pick in the fifth round and an additional draft pick in the seventh round.Sunday night, the Chicago White Sox, a professional baseball team in North America, won the 2005 American League Pennant by defeating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim by a score of 6-3 to achieve their 4th win in the American League Championship Series.

The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) chose Chicago, which has never hosted an Olympics, over the 1932 and 1984 hosts Los Angeles."On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we would like to congratulate Chicago on its selection as our Applicant City," said USOC Chairperson, Peter Ueberroth. "Our ultimate goal at the outset was to identify the U.S. city with the best chance of competing internationally. In Chicago and Los Angeles, we had two outstanding bids and we are confident that Chicago is positioned to be competitive in the international field and will make our country proud."Chicago will now submit a bid to the International Olympic Committee in September 2007, and the host city will be chosen on October 2, 2009. Other cities likely to bid for the Games include Prague, Rome and Tokyo. As the 2008 and 2012 Games are to be held in Asia and Europe respectively, it is likely that a city in the Americas would be favorites for the Games. The United States last held the Games in Atlanta in 1996.Chicago's bid involves construction of an Olympic Stadium in Washington Park on the city's South Side and an athlete's village on the shores of Lake Michigan. Existing venues such as Wrigley Field and Soldier Field may be used for some events. In contrast to Chicago, the Los Angeles bid involved existing facilities with no need for constructing new venues.Chile's national football team has finally removed Roberto Cereceda, a player from Colo-Colo, from the list of players in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.Chilean press had pointed out that Cereceda was the most probable player to be discarded in the final list, although Marcelo Bielsa, coach of the football team, said some weeks ago that his inclusion in the list was not being discussed.The official list of players on the football team follows:On Saturday, host nation Chile defeated Argentina 4–1 over penalties in the 2015 Copa América ((en))Spanish language: ‍America Cup, which was held in Estadio Nacional located in the Chilean city of Santiago, to clinch the title for the very first time.

Gonzalo Higuaín missed some chances to score a goal for Argentina. Argentina has not won any major trophy in the past 22 years.Chile began the penalty-shootout. Chilean players converted each penalty kick into goal, whereas except for FC Barcelona star Lionel Messi, no other Argentine could score a penalty. Misses by Higuaín and Banega turned out to be costly for Argentina and the final strike by Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez sealed the victory by the host nation. Chilean captain Claudio Bravo won the golden glove trophy and Eduardo Vargas won top scorer award.On Wednesday, Chile, the host nation, defeated the defending champions, Uruguay, in the first quarter final of the 2015 Copa América ((en))Spanish language: ‍America Cup which was held in Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos stadium in Santiago, Chile.La Roja had 80% possession of the ball in front of Uruguay.

Cavani got his yellow card at the 29th by arguing with a linesman. 11 minutes later, Uruguayan defender Jorge Fucile was booked for clattering on Vargas. The first half ended with 0–0 score, and four players booked. Cavani's father Luis Cavani was arrested earlier this week over a Monday truck crash in which a 19-year-old motorcyclist was killed. Then, in the 63rd minute Chilean defender Jara provoked Cavani reportedly by putting his finger in Cavani's anus. Cavani touched Jara's face, and Jara fell to the ground causing Cavani to get a card. The Uruguayan team had only nine men left after Fucile received his second yellow card for a foul on Alexis Sánchez.Chile's football team, coached by Marcelo Bielsa, arrived in South Africa on Sunday. The team's leading scorer in South Africa qualifying, Humberto Suazo, is currently injured and it is not known when will he play. Suazo scored ten times.  'La Roja' arrived at Nelspruit, where they were warmly welcomed by local authorities, Chilean residents, and many Chilean fans. "They arrived very well, very relaxed," said Chilean Ambassador Francisco Marambio to AFP. "I welcomed them and I wished them the best," he added.Chile last played in a World Cup at France in 1998, where they managed to reach eighth place."Suazo seems OK, and he's recovering," said Marambio, who talked to Bielsa and Harold Mayne-Nichols, President of the Chilean Football Association. "We aren't a surprise, we aren't the favorites, but we can be," said Mauricio Isla, one of the players.In two separate cases, Chinese police have captured and killed suspected terrorists apparently targeting the 2008 Summer Olympics, and an airplane crew thwarted what appeared to be a planned hijacking, top officials said at a parliament session Sunday. The suspect terrorist gang was found on January 27 in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region in northwest China. Two were killed and fifteen others were arrested. Police seized axes, knives, grenades, and "books about terrorism". "Obviously, the gang had planned an attack targeting the Olympics," said Wang Lequan, Xinjiang's Communist Party chief. "The Olympic Games slated for this August is a big event, but there are always a few people who conspire to commit sabotage. It is no longer a secret now."The gang was said to have collaborated with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a separatist movement labeled a terrorist organization by the United Nations. "Those terrorists, saboteurs and secessionists are to be battered resolutely, no matter what ethnic group they are from," said Wang. Xinjiang is home to a many ethnic Turkic groups, the largest of which are the Uyghur.Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang government and himself an Uyghur, says only a very small minority support the views of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. "They don't represent the Uighur people," he said.In another incident, an airplane destined for Beijing was forced to land early after "some people were attempting to create an air disaster," said Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang government.The plane took off from Urumqi on Friday and landed in Lanzhou, capital of the neighboring Gansu province. The flight crew stopped the alleged attackers, and all passengers and crew are reported to be safe. The plane finally arrived in Beijing Saturday morning."Fortunately our air crew took resolute measures, discovered and put a stop to this action promptly. All the passengers, crew and the aircraft are safe," Bekri said.No further details were made available. The suspects are in custody, as police try to find out "who the people involved in the incident were, where they were from, what their aim was and what their background was", Bekri said. An airline official did not confirm whether the incident was a terrorist attack, saying "it's up to the police department to verify." However, Bekri believes "we can be sure that this was a case intending to create an air crash."An anonymous source told Reuters that flammable material was found in the plane's toilet, and that at least 2 passengers on the flight have been taken into custody for questioning.London, England — Following the second full day of competition at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, China leads the medal race with 13 gold medals and 34 medals in total.

They took Japan out of the game by committing a lot of fouls early on, and finished the first quarter ahead 10–6.  In the second quarter, Japan hurried down the floor to set up their offense before the Chinese had a chance to set up their defense.  They set up their own defense, while not resorting to a full court press.  They also set up effective blocks.  Japan's game fell apart because of low shooting percentage: they could not make baskets when it was their turn on the offense.  The second quarter ended 24–10.

The game ended 53–37.China will start their London Paralympic campaign on August 30 against Mexico while the Japanese women did not qualify.NASCAR and Indy team owners Chip Ganassi and Felix Sabates became the first team owners in history to sweep the three top races in American motor sports. In February, NASCAR driver Jamie McMurray took the checkered flag at the Daytona 500 followed by Scottish driver Dario Franchitti's win in the Indy open wheel series at the Indianapolis 500 in May. Jamie McMurray helped make it a clean sweep when over the weekend he again took the top spot (and his second win of the season) by winning the Brickyard 400, also held at the Indianapolis Motor speedway.Pole sitter Juan Pablo Montoya led the majority of Sunday's race, but in a late pit stop, he and his crew chief Brian Pattie conservatively changed four tires while teammate and rival McMurray changed only two.  As a result, the Colombian born driver fell back in the field, and eventually crashed out of the race. This marks the second time Montoya has dominated this race only to fall short at the end.NASCAR Sprint Cup points leader Kevin Harvick finished in second place, followed by Greg Biffle, Clint Bowyer and Tony Stewart. Ganassi, a former open wheel driver, formed Target Chip Ganassi Racing in 1990. This team entered cars in North America's two leading open wheel series, CART and the Indy Racing League (IRL).  Meanwhile in 1989, Sabates formed SABCO Racing to compete in the NASCAR Cup, the leading stock car class in the United States.  Ganassi's operation merged with SABCO in 2001, forming an organization with teams that compete not only in NASCAR and IRL, but also in sports car endurance racing.  Ganassi drivers won seven open wheel championships between 1996 and 2009.  Missouri NASCAR driver Jamie McMurray re-joined Ganassi's team for the 2010 season, after a five year spell with Roush-Fenway Racing.Also in North American motorsport on Sunday, Spanish rider Jorge Lorenzo took the checkered flag in the United States Grand Prix at California's Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.  Lorenzo's victory on a Fiat Yamaha bike, over Casey Stoner (second) and Valentino Rossi (third), strengthened his points lead in the MotoGP championship.The next race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series  will be held on Sunday at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, where Denny Hamlin is the defending race champion.On Monday, a helicopter accidentally dropped a concrete block weighing nearly 1,500 pounds when it was flying it up to an Austrian mountain for a "ski resort construction project". The concrete block struck a cable holding a gondola, the one that suffered all of the casualties, although other gondolas reported people suffering injuries from the jolt. The car that was hit fell quite some distance to the ground, up to hundreds of meters. Two more cars started tilting as some people were flung out from these cars.  A least nine people are reported to be killed in the incidents. There are also many injured, some of them seriously.  Up to a dozen rescue helicopters immediately rushed to the scene from all over the Swiss alps.The work was made to make the infrastructure more secure after an incident that happened when a low-flying US marine plane cut through a cable killing 20 people in 1998.  This incident will bring into question if those policies saved lives or need to be recast in light of this tragedy.The anonymous individual responsible for suggesting, 14 hours before police discovered the body, that WWE wrestler Chris Benoit's wife was dead is saying his/her comment was a "terrible coincidence."In a post made at 12:26 AM EDT Friday morning to the talk page of a Wikinews article headlined as the "Death of Nancy Benoit rumour posted on Wikipedia hours prior to body being found", the user admitted to writing that Nancy Benoit was dead at the Wikipedia article page for Benoit came from information that was garnered from "rumors and speculation online." The IP Address of the individual making the apology was identical to that of the one who posted the Nancy Benoit rumor, a strong confirmation of the admission's authenticity. The lengthy apology was not signed, with the individual claiming, "I am just an everyday individual who posted a wrongful remark at the time that received so much attention because it turned out to actually happen."  Wikinews originally broke the story about the suspicious edit after receiving a tip from Wikipedia administrators. The fact the edit originated from a computer in Stamford, Connecticut (the site of WWE headquarters) appears to be another coincidence.The anonymous editor left a lengthy apology to the Wikimedia community, explaining, "I hope this puts an end to this speculation that someone knew about the tragedy before it was discovered."Wikinews is continuing to follow the story, but the anonymous user has declined an interview.Below is the full, unedited apology:The British cyclist Chris Froome won the 100th Tour de France yesterday following the conclusion of the final stage in Paris. The final stage of the Tour was won by Marcel Kittel from Germany. Froome's total time for the 3,400 km (2,112 miles) tour was 83 hours, 56 minutes and 40 seconds, four minutes and twenty seconds faster than the runner-up, Nairo Quintana from Colombia.Quintana edged out Froome by eleven points to take the King of the Mountains jersey while Peter Sagan took the green points jersey. 169 riders completed the twenty-stage tour at Paris' Champs Élysées.Last year, Froome came second to Sir Bradley Wiggins who did not participate this year following injuries. Froome's victory speech was dedicated to his mother Jane, who died in 2008 from cancer: "Without her encouragement to follow my dreams, I'd probably be at home watching this event on TV. It's a great shame she never got to come see the Tour, but I'm sure she'd be extremely proud if she were here tonight."British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted congratulations to the 28-year-old Froome: "A brilliant win by Chris Froome. After two British winners it's only right the Tour de France comes to Yorkshire next year".Chris Hughton has been appointed permanent manager of English football club Newcastle United, having previously served as its temporary caretaker manager since the start of the season.  His permanent contract was to run until the end of the 2010–11 season.The 50 year old former Tottenham Hotspur and Republic of Ireland defender joined the club in 2008 when he was appointed Newcastle United assistant manager by Kevin Keegan, with the club at the time in the top flight of English football, the Premier League. Hughton then became temporary Newcastle United caretaker manager twice last season, as managers came and went, and at the end of the season, the club were ultimately relegated to the second tier, the Football League Championship. In his third spell as caretaker, he had been in charge of the club since the start of the season, and had guided the team to the top of the table, and for his efforts was awarded the Football League Championship Manager of the Month twice, for August and September.Hughton stated of his appointment:"It's a very proud day for me to be named as the manager of this magnificent football club. I will be doing everything in my power to get the club back into the Premier League at the first time of asking. Having the unequivocal backing of the players has helped me enormously and I would also like to thank Colin Calderwood, Paul Barron and the rest of the backroom staff who have been tremendously supportive to me this season."According to Sky Sports, many Newcastle fans had 'made no secret of their desire' to see a return to the club as manager of Alan Shearer after relegation and over the summer break. Shearer, the former club captain, was hired on a short term 8 game contract at the end of last season, but could not steer the club away from relegation. As the new season progressed, Hughton remained caretaker, and ten days prior to Hughton's appointment, Shearer had said:"I can't revolve my life around that any more because I have other things going on. If it happens, it happens, and if it doesn't, it doesn't...And at the moment Chris Hughton is doing a great job."The announcement came on the same day as it announced that the club would be putting the naming rights of the club stadium St James' Park up for offers next season, and that owner Mike Ashley was taking the club off the market for a second time."Normal" in the 2007 Ironman Triathlon World Championship was only the fact the sun rose in the east, as shortly past the swim start the day brought forth a hot and cloudless Hawaiian sky; injuries and illnesses to many; DNFs for two years worth of defending champions; and a first-time winner.Australian Chris McCormack, placing 2nd in 2006, passed Aussie Craig Alexander in the marathon and further scorched the Queen Kaahumanu Kaʻahumanu Highway with a 2:42:02 run to claim the world title in 8:15:34.In even more excitement, rookie (her first Ironman length race was seven weeks ago in Korea) Chrissie Wellington, from Great Britain, claimed the women's title finished in 9:08:45.The 6:45 a.m. Hawaii Standard Time start to the 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile time-trial, and a 26.2 mile marathon saw a cascade of unfortunates to favorites. Defending 2006 champions Normann Stadler and Michellie Jones and 2005 champion Faris Al-Sultan were struck down with stomach ailments; six-time winner and 2005 champion Natascha Badmann totaled her bike after crashing into road cone; and Luke Bell was sidelined with a leg injury.But a sense of "normal" returned later in the day as the temperature and winds rose and as many of the 1,788 starters completed before the October 14, 2007 12:00am deadline.Christchurch, New Zealand's Jade stadium says they can host the 2011 Rugby World Cup final if Auckland can't make a decision on whether or not they should build a new stadium on the waterfront or upgrade Auckland's current stadium, Eden Park, costing NZ$500 million and $385 million respectively.Jade Stadium would be able to host the final if they were to include temporary seating to accommodate 60,000 people, required by the International Rugby Board (IRB).Gary Moore, mayor of Christchurch, said that if they were selected to host the final then they will ask the government for $80 million. The stadium is already planning for an upgrade, worth $60 million but that money will be funded from private and charitable organisations as well as the local and central governments. The current upgrade will see Jade stadium's seating capacity grow to 43,000 and if they host a quarter-final or semi-final then temporary seating will increase the seats to 55,000.Trevor Mallard, the Minister of Sport, said that the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Council have both been given about two weeks to tell the government which decision it supports. If they cannot come to a decision then the final will most likely be given to Jade stadium, Christchurch. The least likeliest of all decisions, an upgrade of Carlaw park, but that is designated for a retirement home and on private land.Mr Moore said that he and "stadium officials had offered Jade Stadium as a back-up final venue at a recent informal meeting with Mallard because of the continuing Auckland divisions over a site. This is about New Zealand Inc, not about Christchurch versus Auckland. What we have said to Trevor Mallard is we are able to put a stadium into Christchurch that would accommodate the numbers they would need as an insurance policy if Auckland cannot get its act together. The Government knows that when Christchurch or Canterbury puts its hand up it delivers with excellence."Bryan Pearson, chief executive of Vbase, the company which manages Jade Stadium, said: "It was not uncommon for major sporting venues to add temporary seating for big events. London had included temporary seating for some stadiums as part of its successful Olympic hosting bid. It was not a low-rent option, and was a commercially prudent way to marry short-term opportunity with long-term legacy."Mr Pearson hopes that Jade Stadium will not be used for the final as he understands why the government wants a national stadium, "Let's hope this gets sorted and we can focus our attentions on playing a very major supporting role. We are only a third the size of Auckland, so what we can sustain post-World Cup is nowhere near what Auckland can."Warwick Taylor, former All Black, said it will be great if Christchurch can host the final even though he played in the 1987 final at Eden Park. Though Mr Taylor does say that an Auckland stadium is a better idea as a 60,000 seat stadium is more viable in such a large population city. Mr Taylor said that he "had great memories playing at Eden Park and in some ways would hate to see it lose the final. But I also like the idea of a national stadium."The New Zealand Rugby Union said that a waterfront stadium and an upgrade of Eden Park are the only two options being considered, and no other stadiums are being considered.A lot of people are confirming that Christchurch will be able to cope with the huge amount of visitors that would arrive for the final as Christchurch has the highest per capita amount of restaurants and bars in Australasia. The city also features numerous hotels.If New Zealand cannot deliver a final in a 60,000 seat World Class stadium then the IRB will allocated the final to another country.In the final of the Konami Cup 2007, Chunichi Dragons battled SK Wyverns again, many Japanese spectators hoped for Dragons to take revenge on Wyverns and win the championship. This was really a intensive match with starting pitchers George Kenneth Rayborn from SK versus Daisuke Yamai.Even though Byung-kyu Lee hit a 2 runs HR to expand the difference by the 5-2 leading. But Jin-young Lee also hit a 2 runs HR to tie the score with 5-5 at the bottom of 8th.The key innings took place at the 9th inning, Hirokazu Ibata (Dragons) hit a key run back to make their team lead with 6-5. Finally, the relief pitcher Hitoki Iwase successfully shut down SK's offense and tied the score to the end to win the champion.With the winning hit at this game, and 4 hits with 7 RBIs in the Konami Cup Asia Series 2007, Hirokazu Ibata was finally chosen to be the MVP.After this game, Chunichi Dragons coach Hiromitsu Ochiai remarked: "Even though we ever lose to SK Wyverns, but participants in this year proved their actual strength more than last year. In this game, after we led with 6-5, Hitoki Iwase told me he want to pitch at the bottom of 9th inning, then I accepted, he promised his wish and finally helped us win the champion. I'll not forget the contributions by Ibata and Iwase."Speed skater Cindy Klassen was voted as the 2006 Bobbie Rosenfeld Award's female athlete of the year, on Wednesday. Her second time winning the honour, she was given the award for winning five medals at the 2006 winter Olympic games in Turin, Italy, in February.Klassen had 131 of 144 first-place ballots in voting by sports editors and broadcasters. The editors and broadcasters were surveyed by the Canadian Press and Broadcast News. She finished at 412 points in the Canadian Press award voting. Clara Hughes, of Winnipeg, was second with 104 points and three first-place votes.Hayley Wickenheiser, of Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, had five first-place votes and finished third with 83 points. Wickenheiser helped the Canadian women's hockey team win Olympic gold in Turin."There were so many good moments," Klassen said. "I just had so much fun with my team at the Games."Klassen will also be racing in the 2010 winter Olympic games in Vancouver, British Columbia and in nearby Whistler, British Columbia, a popular snow skiing destination."It's such a tremendous opportunity, to be able to race in your home country and have the home crowd," Klassen said. "You have such a huge advantage." "I'll be 30 then. I hope I get stronger and that I'll be peaking at that age," she said. "As I've seen with a lot of speed skaters, your career goes up and down. I'll just keep trying and hope for the best."Klassen, a Winnipeg, Manitoba native, was also awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy this year. Her five medals made her Canada's most decorated Olympian. She also won the bronze medal in the 3,000 at Salt Lake City, Utah in 2002.On Thursday, Spanish football club FC Barcelona announced their first-choice goalkeeper, Claudio Bravo, was sold to English club Manchester City F.C. for €18 million on a four-year deal. Manchester City is obliged to pay €2 million as add-ons.33-year-old Claudio Bravo joined the Catalonians in the 2014 summer transfer window from Real Sociedad to replace Víctor Valdés.  Bravo conceded only 43 goals in 75 matches overall, 72 La Liga matches, for the club.In 2014, Bravo did not concede a single goal in nine consecutive league matches and set a new La Liga record for consecutive minutes without a concession. That season, he conceded only eighteen goals and won the Zamora Trophy awarded to the goalkeeper with the lowest goal-conceded-per-match ratio. He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season.In two seasons at Camp Nou, Bravo won eight trophies — two La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys, and one each of UEFA Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and Super Copa de España. Last year, Bravo led Chile to their maiden Copa América title and successfully defended the title this year in the Centenario edition of the tournament. He was named Goalkeeper of the Tournament in both tournaments.After signing Manchester City, Bravo said, "It is not easy to leave a club like Barcelona where I had two fantastic years, but the opportunity to work with Pep Guardiola was too good to refuse."Earlier on Thursday, Barcelona announced signing Dutch goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen from AFC Ajax for €13 million.Bravo faces Barcelona in the Champions League group stage, as the draw on Thursday placed Barcelona and Manchester City both in Group C.Caloundra, Queensland —Wikinews attended a roller derby event at the Caloundra Indoor Stadium on Australia's Sunshine Coast yesterday. The event, entitled Springtime Riot, featured the hosting association — the Coastal Assassins Roller Derby (CARD) — fielding two teams, the Rum City Derby Dolls and the Gold Coast Sea Bombers.University of Maine men's ice hockey head coach Tim Whitehead has proposed that the National Collegiate Athletic Association adopt the four-official system.The system, which has two referees and two linesmen, was adopted by the National Hockey League for the 1998/99 season on a trial basis before being fully implemented for 2000/01.“My rationale for the proposal is to get more calls right,” Whitehead told the HockeyRefs.com website. “It’s about getting the best system we can for the game.”Maine competes in Hockey East, one of six Division I conferences. Currently, Division I employs a three-official system of one referee and two assistant referees. Adding a second referee could result in logistical and financial difficulties for both conferences and schools.“This would open a lot of opportunities,” said Whitehead, who isn’t opposed to young, college-age officials doing his games if “they’re the best out there.”The NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Rules Committee will vote on the proposal in JuneFile:St Kilda Saints Jumper.svgFile:Collingwood Magpies Jumper.svgCollingwood and St. Kilda have drawn the 2010 Australian Football League (AFL) Grand Final - the third such occurance in league history - played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

After suffering the blow of failing to get beyond the qualifying stage of the Champions League, Kenwright is known to have recently sought additional investments in the club.While a move is not thought to be imminent, the recent takeover of the brothers' games development company Sports Interactive by game giant SEGA could well prove the catalyst for action by the lifelong Evertonians. The company's PR guru Miles Jacobson was forced into an official denial of the story soon after the takeover news broke on Tuesday morning. The Collyers themselves have as yet been unavailable for comment.On Saturday, in the Copa América match for third place, Colombia defeated hosts United States in the University of Phoenix Stadium, in Arizona. USA had more shots than Colombia, but the Colombians had slightly better ball possession.

Though covered with mud, he was still smiling as he was 23 and a half years before. In October 1985, the statue was tossed into the river by some overjoyed fans of the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, which led to a 'legend' known as "the Curse of Colonel Sanders." On Tuesday afternoon, the upper body of the reinforced plastic statue was found unexpectedly. Osaka City had a plan to lay a paved path along Dōtonbori River, and a contractor diver noticed a figure near the bottom while checking for unexploded World War II bombs. The workers pulled it up, and Tigers fans among them recognized the figure as the Colonel. The lower body was also found on Wednesday morning. The statue still lacks some parts like eyeglasses, feet and left hand, but the contractor reportedly says it's almost impossible for the rest to be found, due to lack of visibility in the water. Osaka City will return the statue, about 180 cm in height, to KFC Japan. Reportedly the company is considering displaying the statue at its franchise in the Tigers home Hanshin Kōshien Stadium in Nishinomiya City, Hyōgo Prefecture (neighboring Osaka Pref.). The story of the Hanshin Tigers and the Colonel statue dates back to October 1985. Because the team got the Central League title for the first time in 21 years, ecstatic fans crowded around Dōtonbori. Some were so overjoyed that they jumped into the river for the team players. Unfortunately no one among them looked like Randy Bass, the team's star slugger. Near them was a KFC franchise (closed 1998), and they presumably found resemblance between Bass and 'Colonel' Sanders (both were bearded). They started to chant "Baassu, Baassu" and tossed the Colonel statue into the river in honor of their hero. The team also won the Japan Series later in that year. However, this was the Hanshin Tigers' last triumph. The team soon fell into a long-term slump, and finished at the bottom among 6 Central League teams in 10 of 16 seasons by 2001. During the slump, some baseball lovers in Japan jokingly said "it was brought by the Curse of Colonel Sanders," which became a legend. The Tigers again got the League title in 2003 and 2005, but the fans' dream of another triumph has not yet come true. Asked whether the 'curse' will be lifted by the discovery, Hanshin Tigers manager Akinobu Mayumi said "now we can not lay (our luck) to it." A KFC Japan press officer said, "Truly, Sanders is a 'gentleman'. The 'curse' must end, and he must back Hanshin up to be a Japan Series Champion."The Colorado College Tigers beat the Spartans of Michigan State University in men's ice hockey on Friday, for the title of champions of the 41st annual Great Lakes Invitational ice hockey tournament at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit.The Tigers, the team chosen to be invited into the tournament and appearing for the first time since 1965 in the tournament, led with a 5-0 lead during the second period, after which Michigan State switched goalies.  The Spartans put freshmen Jeff Lerg into net, replacing Dominic Vicari, who was earlier given a penalty for his contact with a member of Colorado's team in front of the net.  Michigan State junior Tyler Howells scored two goals during the second period, and Colorado student Brett Sterling made the Tiger's final goal for the night.Colorado College took first place in the invitational, and Michigan State ended in second place, after their previous win over Michigan Tech at a score of 3-2.  The Tigers previously beat the University of Michigan on Thursday, at a score of 6-1.Meanwhile, the University of Michigan beat GLI co-sponsor Michigan Tech University with a score of 5-3 for a third place finish in the invitational earlier in the day.With 2 minutes remaining in the third period, the University of Michigan went one up over Michigan Tech, breaking the 3-3 tie. Michigan Tech pulled their goalie with one minute remaining to gain a man advantage, but the strategy failed and allowed the University of Michigan to get another goal resulting in the final 5-3 score.The game secured the third place position in the invitational for University of Michigan, and fourth place for Michigan Tech.The final standings in the tournament are:Colorado CollegeMichigan State UniversityUniversity of MichiganMichigan TechThe Indianapolis Colts won Super Bowl XLI against the Chicago Bears in a 29-17 victory at a rain-soaked Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Quarterback Payton Manning was named the game's Most Valuable Player.Colts coach Tony Dungy became the first African American to coach an American football team to  Super Bowl championship, now in its 41st year. He also became the third person, after Mike Ditka and Tom Flores, to win a Super Bowl as both a coach and as a player: Dungy was on the 1978 Pittsburgh Steelers team that won Super Bowl XIII.Indianapolis did not look like a winning team early in the game. After Chicago won the coin toss, Devin Hester returned the opening Indianapolis kickoff for a 92 yards for a touchdown, giving Chicago the fastest lead in Super Bowl history. On the Indianapolis first drive of the game, Peyton Manning threw an interception to Bears defensive back Chris Harris. However, Chicago could not capitalize on the turnover and punted back to Indianapolis. Manning seemed to get comfortable on the next possession, and burned the Bears defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne. Indianapolis did not convert the touchdown, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the extra point attempt.This was the first of many weather-induced errors for both teams. Indianapolis's Robert Mathis forced a turnover after Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff. But on the next play, Indianapolis gave it back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled a handoff and defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.Chicago scored the next touchdown when Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving his team a 14-6 lead. After forcing a punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts lineman Dwight Freeney on the Bears 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field goal attempt.Following a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinateiri's 29-yard field goal to make the score 14-9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive. On the next Indianapolis drive, Dominic Rhodes took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last, a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16-14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter. After another Chicago punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears 36-yard line before defensive back Charles Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from receiver Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumble a snap and defensive back Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With 2 seconds left, Vinateiri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left and the score remained 16-14 at halftime.Vinatieri redeemed himself in the second half, kicking two field goals in the third quarter to make the score 22-14. Chicago kicker Robbie Gould made a 44-yard field goal to cut the score to 22-17, but they were the last points Chicago would score in the game. On Chicago's next drive, Colts defensive back Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhsin Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, to make the score 29-17.The Colts managed to tame the Bears offense for the remainder of the game. Colts defensive back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass on the next Chicago drive. After trading possessions, Chicago got the ball back one last time with 1:42 in regulation, but it  was not enough for Grossman.Rhodes finished with 113 rushing yards and a touchdown, while Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes for 66 yards. Wilkins returned 4 kickoffs for 183 yards and 3 punts for 42 yards. Jones was the Bears top rusher with 112 yards, while also catching 4 passes for 18 yards. Tight end Desmond Clark was the Bears top receiver with 6 receptions for 64 yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown, with 2 interceptions. The Colts finished with 430 total net yards while the Bears only had 265.Studies conducted by a team of physicists at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) conclude that new synthetic NBA basketballs  are less lively, more slippery when damp, and bounce more erratically than the traditional leather balls. James Horwitz, Chairman of the UTA Department of Physics was contacted by the Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to study the new ball. Horwitz asked UTA physics professor Kaushik De to lead the project. De's team found that the new balls are tackier when dry, but become much more slippery than leather balls when they get damp. Traditional leather basketballs provide more grip when they are slightly wet. The synthetic balls bounce 30% more sporadically, possibly due to deep embossing, and are less lively than leather basketballs. Some of these issues could be fixed with a variety of methods, including modification of the embossing, increasing the air pressure in the balls beyond the regulation 8.5 psi, and constantly drying the balls with towels during the game or frequently replacing them with fresh basketballs, say De and Horwitz.Gary Neville is likely to face an inquiry from the Football Association as complaints filter in from Liverpool Supporters present at the game. Neville, who had ran the entire length of the pitch celebrating, was alleged to remark inappropriate comments at the fans, after they had taunted him the entire game.The true nature of these comments, however, is yet to transpire, but due to police intervention, it may be thought they were anfield related, although such claims are unfounded. Despite the fact Neville has not been formally charged, the attacks have, at least prompted police to request the referee's report so they are able to fully start correspondence with the FA.Spaniard Alberto Contador of team Astana has won the 2009 Tour de France after crossing the line in a final time of 85:48:35 for the 21-stage grand tour. Andy Schleck from Luxembourg came in second place. Schleck, riding for Team Saxo Bank also won the maillot blanc for the young riders' classification.American Lance Armstrong of Astana claimed the final podium spot, 5:24 behind Contador. The seven-time Tour-winner returned from retirement after winning the 2005 Tour de France. Winning the final stage at Champs-Élysées in Paris, France, was Mark Cavendish in a time of 4:02:18. The British cyclist won six stages this year, topping his achievement of four stage wins last year.The points classification was won by Thor Hushovd of Norway with 280. The Cervélo TestTeam rider finished ahead of Team Columbia-HTC's Cavendish, despite the latter's multiple stage wins.The King of the Mountains winner is Italian Franco Pellizotti, riding for Liquigas, who also got the additional honor of being the most aggressive rider. Team Astana, with two men on the podium, won the team classification.Controversy is being expressed over Stephen Harper's decision to skip the House of Commons vote for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on Wednesday for a hockey game at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. Liberal MPs say that this reveals Mr. Harper's true attitude toward the environment. "It shows the importance he gives to Kyoto and climate change," said Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez. "What kind of example does that send to Canadians?"Harper was with his ten-year-old son Ben cheering on for the Toronto Maple  Leafs and sat in seats in the platinum level of the Air Canada Centre, next to Larry Tanenbaum, head of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the company that owns the Leafs. Also seated with Mr. Tanenbaum was Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and his wife, Terri."You know I'm dead meat if I make those kind of predictions in hockey," said Harper, who must juggle support from voters in six Canadian NHL cities. "I think Ben will be cheering for the Toronto Maple Leafs," Harper told The Canadian Press. "That's his team."Harper and his son met with the members of the Toronto team after the game was finished.Opposition MPs say that "the decision to put pucks over Parliament shows that environmental issues rate as a low priority for Mr. Harper, who had no other reason to be in Toronto the day he attended the NHL season opener between the Maple Leafs and the Ottawa Senators."Members of Parliament and the prime minister are not required to attend votes in the House of Commons and routinely miss them when dealing with other business. If Mr. Harper was there, his vote would not have changed the outcome.   The PM will be writing a whole book on the history of the game. But demands of his day job have slowed down the project.Cook Islands and Wakefield Trinity Wildcats rugby league player Adam Watene has died. The Wildcats announced the death of the 31-year-old earlier today. They reported he collapsed in the gym shortly after a training session.A spokesman said, "The Wakefield Trinity Wildcats are sad to announce the sudden passing of Adam Watene. The circumstances surrounding Adam’s death were sudden and unexpected. Everyone at the Wildcats' thoughts are with Adam’s family, and we ask for their privacy to be respected at this difficult time."Watene started his rugby league with the Castleford Tigers and was later signed by the Bradford Bulls. After a year of playing for the bulls of which he only made five first team appearances, he was allowed to sign for the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. He played a total of 28 games in the two seasons he was with the club. The Wildcats also said "There will be no further comment from the club at this stage." Watene is survived by his wife and two children.With the Australian Para-alpine ski team set to arrive in Vail today (Wednesday) for the start of the IPC Nor-Am Cup to be held on Copper Mountain this coming Sunday, both areas are dealing with unseasonably warm weather that adversely effects skiing conditions.An inch of snow fell on Copper Mountain and Vail Sunday night, one–two inches less than forecast. The weather conditions are not expected to improve to bring snow bearing conditions for a while as the area experiences day time temperatures in the 50s °F/10s °C. The lack of snow delayed the opening of a number of ski resorts in the area, with only six open by November 16.  Copper Mountain required use of snow machines to keep snow on their ski runs.  The lack of quality snow was a factor in a downturn by about 12% in visitors to Colorado's ski resorts.  Currently, the snow is machine groomed and the majority of ski lifts and trails are not open.Deputy Tourism Minister Frederico Silva da Costa was among 33 Brazilian tourism ministers and officials arrested for embezzlement of public funds on Tuesday. The operation extended across Brasilia, Sao Paulo and Macapa.The arrests were made following an operation involving up to 200 police officers. Five wanted officials remain at large. Federal Police allege the officials were involved in a scheme that has the potential to destabilise the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.The group are said to have used up to R$3.05 million (US$1.88 million,£1.16 million)—allocated in government funding to train almost 2000 taxi drivers, waiters and hotel staff in the lead-up to the events—for private gain.Federal Police say they intend to charge all 38 (including the five not yet apprehended) with criminal associations, fraud and embezzlement. If found guilty, they face up to twelve years imprisonment.This is the latest in a string of corruption scandals throughout the nation, which saw Transport Minister Alfredo Nascimento and thirty colleagues resign in July, while a senior Agriculture minister was sacked. A further scandal claimed the President’s chief of staff earlier this year.President Dilma Rousseff wrote in "Conversation with the President"—her weekly column—that "[i]t looks like corruption is increasing, but what really is increasing is the investigation and identification of criminals".The arrests follow 63 similar anti-corruption operations carried out last year by Federal Police in conjunction with government organisations.The nation now faces an uphill battle to be ready in time for the commencement of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and the 2016 Olypmic Games.On Wednesday, Italian football club Juventus announced an agreement with German club Bayern Munich for a one-year loan of Brazilian winger Douglas Costa for a fee of €6 million, to run until June 30, 2018.26-year-old Douglas Costa joined Bayern in 2015 under Pep Guardiola's management from Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk. In two seasons at the Allianz Arena, Costa has scored fourteen goals and provided 27 assists, making 77 appearances in total. He won two consecutive Bundesliga titles, a DFB Pokal, and a DFL-Supercup. Before joining the Bavarian club, the left-footed winger won five consecutive Ukrainian Premier League trophies.In the agreement with Bayern, Juventus can exercise an option to buy the player for €40 million before July 1, 2018. Bayern may receive an additional €1 million subject to conditions in the contract. Bayern Munich's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said, "We had serious and constructive talks with Juventus' representatives. All of FC Bayern's financial demands have been met". Upon asking why he joined Juventus, Costa told the Juventus' interviewer that he "had always dreamed of playing" with the Old Lady and said he was "delighted to be part of" Juventus' team.In an exhibition warmup to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Iran defeated Costa Rica in Tehran's Azadi Stadium.

Per Mertesacker brought down Diego Costa after a pass from Willian gave Costa a good opportunity to run towards Arsenal's goal, and the referee showed Mertesacker the red card. Five minutes later, Costa scored at close range from Branislav Ivanović's cross, putting the visitors 1–0 ahead. The local derby saw four yellow cards and at least 25 fouls. Oscar was the first player to be booked in the 11th minute.  Mathieu Flamini was shown a yellow card for a late tackle on Willian moments before the end of the first half. The Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger substituted Alexis Sánchez for Joel Campbell in the 57th minute. Three minutes later, Nemanja Matić received a yellow card. Costa was injured during the match, and Loïc Rémy replaced him in the 68th minute. John Obi Mikel was booked in the 72nd minute. The match ended 0–1, and Guus Hiddink's team, who had had the greater share of possession of the ball during the match, collected three points.After the match, Wenger blamed Costa for Mertesacker's sending-off. Wenger said, "He got him sent off — you cannot say it's not true."In Sunday's other Premier League match, Everton lost 1–2 at home to Swansea.David Coulthard, a former driver for the McLaren and Red Bull Formula One teams, has said the sport's governing body should have punished a Renault driver for cheating. Nelson Piquet Jr. was granted immunity as a whistleblower.Renault ordered Piquet to crash his car during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, which he did. This benefited team-mate Fernando Alonso's race strategy, and he went on to win the event. After being fired midway through the current season, Piquet told the FIA, who oversee F1, that the team had been cheating.Renault were banned for life, suspended by two years, just before this year's Singapore Grand Prix. At the same hearing, head engineer Pat Symonds was banned for five years and manager Flavio Briatore for life. Alonso is not thought to have been aware of the scheme. Coulthard expressed dissatisfaction at that result today during a Red Bull event in Mumbai.The Times of India has revealed that Coulthard said today, "I think FIA should have punished Piquet too. He was equally guilty as any other." Coulthard, who drives an F1 car across a new sea bridge in Mumbai on Sunday, said, "I will be surprised if he gets an F1 drive again," and that the scandal had shaken him.Another F1 driver in the news is Felipe Massa. Massa was seriously injured at the Hungaroring in Hungary when a spring came off a car ahead of him and struck his helmet at 160 mph. He spent ten days in intensive care at a military hospital and has a metal plate in his head to mend his fractured skull.Now, on Monday he intends to drive a 2007 Ferrari F1 car in Italy, just over 11 weeks after the accident. Massa has already driven a cart in his homeland of Brazil and recently underwent simulator testing. He is set to wave the flag at the finish line of this year's race in Brazil.Massa, whose injuries were considered life threatening, spoke out earlier this month about the fact that Alonso's Singapore win cost him points that would have meant victory in the drivers' championship had he topped the podium. "All of what happened was robbery... It changed the championship. I lost by one point."He also said the sentences should have been tougher. He compared the case to a cheating football team. "The team responsible were relegated. Here they just sent Briatore home. I don't understand it and I don't think it was right."2006 Tour de France champion Floyd Landis will be stripped of his title after test results revealed, Friday, the cyclist used synthetic testosterone during the competition.Landis may also face a two year ban, even though he has repeatedly denied using any performance-enhancing drugs.The final option that would salvage Landis' title is to file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He has one month to file the appeal.If Landis is not able to save his title, he will be the first person in over 105 years to lose the title because of a drug charge.U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart said, "Today's ruling is a victory for all clean athletes and everyone who values fair and honest competition."Landis said, "This ruling is a blow to athletes and cyclists everywhere...For the Panel to find in favor of USADA when, with respect to so many issues, USADA did not manage to prove even the most basic parts of their case shows that this system is fundamentally flawed. I am innocent, and we proved I am innocent."On Sunday the 888 Race Engineering team of Craig Lowndes and Jamie Wincup took out this year Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 and took the first ever "Kings of the Mountain" trophy - in honour of Peter Brock - home. The race was plagued with 10 safety car appearances with a little over a third of the field be wiped out, with Mark Skaife, the race favourite, being knocked out in the first lap.

Carpenter's car hit the raceway wall and went into a spin down the race track when Dana hit his car on the side while travelling at over 200 mph (321 km/h).  The team reported that Paul was warned of the danger by his spotter, but did not ease off as much as other drivers in the section of the track. The slow-motion footage appeared to show Paul hitting debris from Ed's car a few seconds before the main impact.Both were taken to a nearby hospital, where Dana died nearly two hours later, shortly after noon local time (1700 UTC).  According to Henry Block, senior director of medical services for the IRL, Carpenter was listed in stable condition at the hospital.Dana's wife, who was attending a church service in Indianapolis at the time, was informed of his death shortly afterwards.Despite Dana's death, the Toyota 300 continued as scheduled. However, teammates Danica Patrick and Buddy Rice did not compete. Dan Wheldon beat Helio Castroneves by the car's cone nose to win the race.  Wheldon had placed Dana's number, #17, onto his car before the race.Dana's death is the first in the league for nearly three years.  Tony Renna, the last driver in the league to die in a fatal accident, was killed during a test at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Dana was also the first death at Homestead since 1997, when NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series racer John Nemechek was killed in an accident.Morayfield, Australia — Sunshine Coast, Australia based roller derby team Crash Test Hunniez defeated Devotchkas 275 to 98 yesterday in their round two Queensland Roller Derby Leagues Open Season contest at the Morayfield Leisure Centre.

It is New Zealand's fifth consecutive victory and the fourth consecutive defeat for Afghanistan. Afghanistan batted first and were bowled out in 47.4 overs, setting the target of 186 runs for New Zealand to chase. In response, New Zealand scored 188 for four with 83 balls remaining in their innings. Najibullah Zadran scored the most runs of his team with 56, followed by Samiullah Shenwari with 54.

The club provided two-thirds of the players in the Politicians' team – Queensland State Parliament Member for Buderim Steve Dickson and Sunshine Coast Councillors Ted Hangerford and Chris Thompson were the only politicians in the team.A four over 'retirement' rule was implemented in this match. This meant that the opening batsman, who had scored 38 to that point, had to allow other team members to bat. This seemingly caused a middle order collapse with five wickets being taken in as many overs. 53 runs were scored in this time. The team managed to stabilise the innings compiling a further 130 to finish with 10 out (of 12 available batsmen) for 220 runs. Requiring just over eleven runs an over to win, the Cricket Club XI scored 26 off the first over. After ten overs however they were five out for 107, still needing 114 to win - a run rate of 11.4 and over. The Cricket Club XI did not make the required score of 221. After 20 overs, the were nine out for 211.In the 2007 Future Cup, South Africa beat India in the first One-Day International (ODI) held at the Civil Service Cricket Club Ground, Belfast, Ireland. After South Africa won the toss and chose to field first, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly opened India's innings. Ganguly left quickly and Gautam Gambhir left without troubling the scorers. However, Tendulkar found some long term company with Rahul Dravid and pushed the score to 194/2 before Dravid left on 74. It wasn't long before Tendulkar himself found himself runout by Morne van Wyk/Mark Boucher for 99 with the score on 211. A batting collapse ensued and at the end of the innings, India's score was 242/8. South Africa's reply started with a steady opening partnership of AB de Villiers and Morne van Wyk which added 56 before de Villiers departed with a catch to the keeper. Jacques Kallis then came in and scored 91. Even though partnerships didn't last long, Kallis battled secured India's fate.Toss: South Africa won, and chose to field first.Did not bat: Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap SinghFall of wickets: 1-24 (Ganguly, 7.2 ov), 2-36 (Gambhir, 11.1 ov), 3-194 (Dravid, 43.2 ov), 4-211 (Tendulkar, 45.3 ov), 5-213 (Yuvraj Singh, 46.1 ov), 6-234 (Karthik, 48.3 ov), 7-240 (Sharma, 49.2 ov), 8-242 (Powar, 49.6 ov)Did not bat: Charl Langeveldt, Andre Nel, Makhaya NtiniFall of wickets: 1-56 (de Villiers, 12.5 ov), 2-99 (van Wyk, 19.5 ov), 3-107 (Gibbs, 21.1 ov), 4-124 (Duminy, 24.5 ov), 5-165 (Boucher, 34.3 ov), 6-190 (Hall, 39.4 ov)India: S C Ganguly, S R Tendulkar, G Gambhir , R Dravid(capt), Yuvraj Singh, K D Karthik(wkt), R P Sharma , Piyush Chawla, R R Powar, Z Khan, R P SinghSouth Africa: AB de Villiers, M N van Wyk, J H Kallis (capt), H H Gibbs, J P Duminy, M V Boucher(wkt), A J Hall, V D Philander, C K Langeveldt, A Nel, M NtiniResult: South Africa won by 4 wicketsPlayer of the match: Jacques Kallis (South Africa)Umpires: Aleem Dar (Pakistan) and M R Davis (England)TV umpire: B F Bowden (New Zealand)Match referee: A G Hurst (Australia)Reserve umpire: C McElweeIn the 2007 Future Cup, India beat South Africa by six wickets in the second One-Day International (ODI) held at the Civil Service Cricket Club Ground, Stormont, Belfast, Northern Ireland.The best of three series now stands level at 1-1 after South Africa's victory in the first ODI.Sachin Tendulkar, in posting a score of 93, became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in one day cricket.Toss: India won, and chose to field first.Did not bat: T Tshabalala, CK Langeveldt, M NtiniFall of wickets: 1-2 (de Villiers, 3.1 ov), 2-7 (Kallis, 5.2 ov), 3-46 (Gibbs, 13.3 ov), 4-131 (Duminy, 32.3 ov), 5-168 (van Wyk, 40.6 ov), 6-220 (Hall, 48.4 ov)Did not bat: Piyush Chawla, RR Powar, Z Khan, RP Singh, I SharmaFall of wickets: 1-134 (Ganguly, 28.1 ov), 2-140 (Dravid, 30.6 ov), 3-140 (Tendulkar, 31.5 ov), 4-142 (Dhoni, 32.4 ov)India: S C Ganguly, S R Tendulkar, R Dravid(capt), Yuvraj Singh, K D Karthik.

India won the toss, and Indian captain Anil Kumble elected to bat. India quickly made a half century in nine overs.

The main cause of this was the outstanding bowling of Muralitharan who took a five wicket haul. The Sri Lankans capitalised on this and started building a mammoth of an innings of 577 before declaring six wickets down.

This was confirmed by an ICC Board teleconference.ICC President David Morgan said, "I think the Board has made a sensible decision that will give the event every chance of success. We now have clarity on the subject and we can make firm plans for what is going to be a great spectacle of ODI cricket." He also thanked the Sri Lankan Board for their commitment.The tournament features eight national test cricket teams competing in One Day Internationals. The games will be conducted in Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg and SuperSport Park, Pretoria. It will be held from September 24 to October 5, 2009 in these two venues.The West Indies cricket team held on to a draw in the fifth and final test of the five match test series at Queen's Park Oval, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad against the England cricket team to win the five test series 1-0 and regain the Wisden trophy after a gap of nine years. This is their first major test series victory in five years.To win the match, West Indies were set a target of 240 runs in 66 overs or to bat two sessions for a draw. West Indies pair of Fidel Edwards and Denesh Ramdhin thwarted the English attack to finish on 114-8 and drawing the match.Earlier in the day Kevin Pietersen scored 102 runs to enable England to declare at 237/6 in their second innings.

The car, worth approximately £200,000 ($305,000) was totally destroyed. A wheel came off the car and debris was placed all over the road. Ronaldo was not injured during the crash and no other vehicles were involved. Team mate, Goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar was said to be following behind Ronaldo.Ronaldo turned up for training later in the day. He has been with Manchester United since 2003 and scored 74 goals in 178 games. He has also scored 21 goals for Portugal and has competed for them in Euro 2004 and 2008 as well as the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2004 Summer Olympics. He returned to the training ground in his £150,000 Bentley.Police released a statement saying "at about 10:20 a.m. police were called to the A538 Wilmslow Road near to Manchester Airport following reports of a road traffic collision. Officers attended and discovered a Ferrari had collided with a barrier. No one is believed to have been injured. Inquiries are continuing." The statement also added that Ronaldo was not intoxicated.After intense campaigning during the week, yesterday at GAA Congress delegates voted to open Croke Park to Soccer and Rugby by 227 votes to 97. The stadium which can seat 82,500, is by far Ireland's largest and indeed one of the largest in Europe.Traditionally soccer and rugby internationals had been played in the much smaller Landsdowne Road stadium, but due to redevelopment it seemed that all internationals would have to be played in the UK. However this situation has now been avoided with the vote by delegates to amend Rule 42 to allow soccer and rugby to be played at Croke Park during the redevelopment of Landsdowne Road. The works are expected to take three years to complete.The international matches that can now be played in Dublin are expected to generate several million euros of revenue for the local economy.Australian actor Russell Crowe and businessman Peter Holmes a Court have succeeded in their bid to take over the South Sydney Rabbitohs, an Australian National Rugby League (NRL) Club. The men required that 75% of the club's members vote yes on the $3 million takeover bid for it to pass; and it narrowly won, by just 32 votes (0.8%). Former Souths player and manager, George Piggins, has vowed never to attend another game of his former club.Supporters of the bid have said it gives the Rabbitohs a chance to return to their glory days after last year's finish of 13th in the 15-team competition. The team has not won a Premiership in 35 years but still retains the record for most Premiership wins, with 20 on the record books. Those against the bid objected that the club is selling out 98 years of heritage.The rugby union side, the Crusaders, are to meet the Hurricanes in Christchurch on Saturday night for the 2006 Super 14 final after defeating the Bulls 35–15 at Jade Stadium.The match started with both sides being lead out by regular field players, as opposed to the traditional captains leading out their respective sides. Greg Sommerville lead out the Crusaders, in honour of his 100th match for the side, while Bakkies Botha lead out the Bulls in recognition of his 50th match milestone.The Bulls were on the back foot immediately after Fourie du Preez knocked on a Daniel Carter kick. The Bulls also failed to capitalize early on, with Morné Steyn missing a 35 m penalty kick straight in front in the 7th minute.The scoring opened up in the 16th minute, with All Black flyhalf and 2005 IRB World player of the year Daniel Carter kicking a penalty for the Crusaders, as well as taking his own season tally to 200 points.After a Leon MacDonald chip kick, which he managed to regather, the Crusaders were able to produce quick ruck ball which ended with a grubber by centre Casey Laulala for winger Rico Gear to run on to and place down for the first try of the match. Carter subsequently missed the resulting conversion.The Bulls' first points came in the 29th minute with Steyn kicking a 40m penalty to put three points on the board for the South African team. However, nearly straight after the kickoff, the Crusaders forced a turn over and again were able to produce quick ruck ball for Laulala to put away Gear for his second try of the night. Carter missed the conversion, which was in a similar position to the first.Carter was then able to lengthen the Crusaders' lead with a dropped goal 35m out. After some good mauling, Springboks' winger Bryan Habana was able to score a try for the Bulls in the corner just before the stroke of halftime. Steyn missed the conversion, leaving the score 16–8 in favour of the Crusaders at half time.In the second half, the Crusaders scored a try through lock Chris Jack after 17 phases, most of which consisted of pick and goes. This drew the Bulls fowards in and allowed half back Andrew Ellis to pass out to Jack who scored. Carter kicked the conversion to make it 23–8.Four minutes into the second half, promising young scrum half Andrew Ellis went down with what appeared to be an injury to his right knee. He was ably replace by All Black scrum half Kevin Senio. Three minutes later, Habana went down with a leg injury. This could be potentially devastating news for Springboks coach Jake White. Reserve scrum half Senio later went off to the blood-bin, forcing Cameron McIntyre on.  Carter then switched into scrum half until Senio returned for McIntyre.After the Bulls managed to control the ball for the next 20 minutes, the Crusaders forced a turn over. Fullback MacDonald was able to place a grubber into the corner, going out off a Bulls player. Some quick thinking by Aaron Mauger to throw the ball in quickly resulted in try to hooker Corey Flynn, which is his second in two weeks. Carter missed the subsequent coversion.Mauger was again involved in the action later, this time scoring himself an impressive try in the 67th minute. After receiving a high pass from Carter, Mauger ran 51 m to score, beating 4 tacklers in the process and scoring the try in the 5th tackle. Carter converted and in doing so eclipsed Andrew Mehrten's record of 206 points in a season.Late in the game, Pierre Spies scored a consolation try after quick ruck ball and breaking a Senio tackle. Steyn converted. This left it a 35–15, the final score.After the match, Bulls captain Victor Matfield praised the Crusaders: "They punished us like they always do".The Bulls loss continues their poor run at Jade Stadium, having won only once, back in 1996. In fact, the Crusaders have not lost at Jade since round 2, 2004. It also continued the run of New Zealand teams - no New Zealand team has lost to a South African team in a semi.The Crusaders started the match as large favourites, paying $1.07 compared to the Bulls $7.00.The final will be held at 7:35 p.m., Saturday, May 27 at Jade Stadium. It is the fourth all New Zealand final in 11 seasons of super rugby. It is expected to be a sell out.The CTV Television Network has acquired the rights to The Hockey Theme.

The matchup will take place in PETCO Park, San Diego California. Coaches Higinio Velez of Cuba and Sadaharu Oh of Japan highly praised both teams. "We know the Asians," Velez said. "We have played against the Asians, we know how the Asian teams play, and they're great players. They put everything into the field, great effort, very similar to Latin American players.

Cuba has a record of 5-1 against Japan at the Summer Olympics.Cuba defeated a MLB player-filled team from the Dominican Republic 3-1 to earn this berth to the finals.  Vicyohandri Odelin has been rumored to be the starter for Cuba tonight. Cuba has no MLB players, whereas the Japanese team has two—Ichiro Suzuki and Akinori Otsuka. Cuba has earned a medal at each Olympiad, taking the gold in 1992, 1996, 2004 and the silver in 2000. Before the World Baseball Classic even began, Cuba was at risk of not being able to attend, due to tension between the US and Cuba. However, Cuba has gone all the way with a 5-2 record, knocking out Panama, the Netherlands, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic in the semifinal.Japan barely made it into the semifinals through a complicated tiebreaking process, and managed to defeat an undefeated South Korean team that had beaten them twice before with a shutout, 6-0. A two-run homer by young Kosuke Fukodome sealed the game. Led by their powerful coach, Sadaharu Oh, Japan was favored as the major Asian power, but instead struggled through qualification with a 3-3 record. They ravaged Taiwan, China, and Mexico, but failed to overcome the United States or Korea. Ichiro Suzuki has led this team into the finals with a .345 average, one homer, and four stolen bases.Cuban Taekwondo athlete Ángel Matos was banned for life yesterday after an assault on Swedish referee Chakir Chelbat during the 2008 Beijing Olympic games. Matos was competing in the bronze medal match against Arman Chilmanov of Kazakhstan when he sustained an injury.

Finning will be compete in the men's tandem track and road events where he will serve as Bryce Lindores's pilot.Finning was not originally to be on the team, and is a last-minute replacement for Mark Jamieson who found himself unable to acquire a visa to compete at the Games because of a criminal conviction on his record.The pairing is not a new one, as the duo had competed together at the 2010 Road World Cup and 2011 UCI Para-Cycling Track World Championships.  Finning had stepped away from tandem cycling for a while in order to pursue his own individual cycling ambitions, which saw him compete in February at the Ararat Classic Track Carnival and in March at the Bendigo International Madison and the Oceania championships in New Zealand.Finning and Bryce's 2012 Paralympic campaign gets underway on August 30 at the Velodrome for track events and September 4 at Brand’s Hatch for road events.Mount Stromlo, Canberra — This Easter weekend, elite mountain bike riders competed in the Australian 24-hour solo championships at Canberra's Stromlo Forest Park. Jason English from Port MacQuarie rode 33 laps and won the men's race. Liz Smith from Wollongong rode 25 laps and won the women's race.Races are won by riding the most laps. If two riders complete the same number of laps in 24-hours, the winner is the one who has ridden them in the shortest time. Riders wear lights on their helmets and bicycles during night laps. Due to the time of year, there is roughly twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of darkness each day.   The event is a curtain raiser for the WEMBO World Solo 24 hour Mountain Bike Championships, which will be held at Stromlo Forest Park on 12 and 13 October 2013. The race was for solo riders only. The weekend before, the teams of riders took to the track at the Mont 24 hour race at Canberra's Kowen forest. With over 3,000 riders participating, it is now Australia's largest cycling race. The team version of the race was favoured by the weekend warriors, but also attracted more than a few elite athletes. Laps were ridden in relay fashion: each rider handed over the baton (which looked like a credit card) to another member of the team after riding one or more laps.The track was in excellent condition, running through the trees. Without steep climbs or overly difficult technical sections, it permitted fast lap times. No injuries were reported.On Monday Daimler AG announced a deal to buy a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP.As a result, the team who won both the 2009 Drivers’ and Constructors' championships this year with Mercedes-engined cars, would be rebranded as Mercedes Grand Prix from 2010 Formula One Season onwards.

The rest of the shares will stay for Ross Brawn, who will remain as team principal, and Nick Fry.The team still will be headquartered in Brackley (United Kingdom) which is close to Mercedes F1 engine plant at Brixworth, led by Norbert Haug, Vice-President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport.Mercedes will also continue to supply McLaren with engines until at least 2015, but sell its 40% stake in two years.Mercedes is now up to decide their drivers for the next season as Rubens Barrichello already signed a contract with Williams and Jenson Button could run for McLaren together with Lewis Hamilton.Daisy Dick has won the Barbury Castle International CCI 3* horse trials on Spring Along, her 16-year old veteran horse.Andrew Nicholson came second on Neroe, with Sam Watson on Bushman came third.  Badminton Horse Trials winner Oli Townend disappointed fans, gathering 19 penalties in show jumping on Flint Curtis.Daisy Dick said "I was happy with my dressage as I knew he can do a good test, I'm just glad he decided to do it here!  I'm annoyed with my time penalty but I know exactly where I lost the time - just one too many pulls but I did feel really fast - he was like a rocket! It was a big build up through the day in the horse boxes and its always a hell of a buzz here at Barbury so wouldn't want to be on any other horse. He really deserves the win today, it's about time as we've been second so many times. He's feeling so well - more like an eight-year-old and he was brilliant today."The Dallas Mavericks beat the Miami Heat 99-85 in the second game of the NBA Finals  and lead the series 2-0.  The second game was solidly in Dallas' favor the entire time.Miami star Shaquille O'Neal scored his career low in points for a playoff game and sat out the final 15 minutes.  O'Neal was handed a $10,000 fine, as well as a $25,000 fine for the team, for declining to speak to reporters after the game.Miami head coach, Pat Riley, said "I've been in a lot of playoff games, and I've gotten beat by 40, 30, 25, won by 25 or 30.

The host of the festival is the Marvin Lee Stadium; Lee was the captain of the Trinidad and Tobago national football team and died during a match in 2003 when he collided with Landon Donovan, a current teammate of Beckham.Critism was also brought up over the choice of Beckham to host the festival. Trinidadian footballer Dwight Yorke is reported to have been upset with the choice of Beckham over himself or cricketing legend Brian Lara.

Sadly that wasn't to be. This decision has been the most difficult of my career to date. But after discussing it with my family and those closest to me I feel the time is right," he said.Beckham became the captain in 2000 by caretaker manager Peter Taylor. He had served 58 games of the 92 he has played as the national captain.Soccer player David Beckham has had surgery for an injury to his Achilles tendon.

The injury will end his season, and rehabilitation for the wound is expected to take up to six months.  The doctor performing the operation said that training could not begin until June, and it would be at least another month before Beckham could return to playing competitively.  Despite early speculation that the injury could mark the end of Beckham's 18-year career, a spokesman rejected the claims, saying, "This is not the end of his playing career as has been suggested."  In the same statement, it was said that even if Beckham is unable to play in the World Cup, he will continue to play as a member of an American team, the Los Angeles Galaxy, during the end of the season.Beckham sustained the injury near the end of a game on Sunday night, when he suddenly stopped running and limped from the field on his healthy leg before collapsing on the sidelines.

The Spaniard has been in hospital since her collision with one of the team's support vehicles on Tuesday.De Villota has had two operations since her accident. After the first, overnight on Tuesday at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, it was reported in a press release by Marussia that she had lost her right eye, and was still in a "critical but stable" condition. On Friday, she underwent a second operation, according to Marussia, "a planned procedure that would depend upon the continued stability of Maria’s head injuries, and this morning the medical team were sufficiently happy with her progress to allow the operation to go ahead." Subsequent to the operation, her condition was upgraded to "serious but stable".Her sister, Isabel de Villota, has thanked both F1 fans and drivers for their response, saying "We remain positive and this is due, in no small part, to the overwhelming expression of love for Maria from every corner of the world." Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso was among those expressing his support, dedicating his pole postion in Saturday's qualifying to De Villota.Regarding the accident itself, F1 Race Director Charlie Whiting is of the opinion that it was a "one-in-five-million" fluke. Despite questions being raised, both about De Villota's experience and the positioning of the truck with which she collided, he has described it as "so unique that it was just incredible bad luck".Swimmer Matthew Klotz of the United States has broken his second backstroke world record in Sofia, Bulgaria during the 2013 Deaflympics.The high school senior had previously in the 2013 Deaflympics broken the 100 metre backstroke record, continuing his streak by breaking the record for the same stroke in the 200 metre event.The latter record, previously held by South Africa, Klotz broke twice, in both the preliminaries and the finals, with his final time of 2:07.43 breaking the original record by over a second.Klotz also set a record leadoff time in the 4 X 100 medley relay."It was pretty exciting because I kept getting faster and faster", said Klotz after his first record-breaking event, in a media release. "It was a close race — two Japanese swimmers finished right behind me".Klotz also took home bronze in the 400 metre individual medley, came fourth in the 400 metre freestyle, fifth in the 50 metre backstroke, and eighth in the 200 metre freestyle.The 17-year-old was to fly home to Cameron Park, California on Monday.

On a paragraph about an earlier fight: "However, Chris Benoit was replaced… due to personal issues,…", the anonymous editor added " stemming from the death of his wife Nancy." The edit was reversed just under one hour later with the comment: "Need a reliable source. Saying that his wife died is a pretty big statement, you need to back it up with something."Then just one hour later after the first edit reversion, another anonymous edit by 125.63.148.173 using unwiredAustralia.com.au, a wireless Internet service provider, was made adding about the aforementioned personal issues: "which according to several pro wrestling websites is attributed to the passing of Benoit's wife, Nancy." That edit was reverted just under 20 minutes later, with the comment: "Saying 'several pro wrestling websites' is still not reliable information."Further investigation shows that the IP address used to make the first edit is located in Connecticut, but the IP address is not linked to any computers or servers used by the WWE, but according to Cary Bass, Volunteer Coordinator for the Wikimedia Foundation, the IP address matches a location in Stamford, Connecticut where the WWE headquarters is located. Bass also informed the local authorities in Atlanta about the unusual edits, but it is not known if the edits were investigated by the police. The second edit was made by a computer in Australia from a wireless network."It didn't become apparent until someone put the pieces together and realized that the comment was made by someone who apparently knew about the murders," added Bass.Fayette County Sheriff deputy Lt. Tommy Pope stated that police found the family at about 2:30 p.m. ET, which is 18:30 UTC, on Monday when the WWE called police and asked them to do a "welfare check" after employees of WWE received calls and text messages from Chris Benoit. Early Sunday, Benoit sent repeated text messages that read "My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane, Fayetteville Georgia. 30215." Another text message reportedly said "The dogs are in the enclosed pool area. Garage side door is open." The messages were sent around 4:00 a.m. ET.Earlier, on Saturday afternoon, Chris Benoit placed a series of calls that explained why he missed his flight to Houston. The stories he told were mostly about his wife and son being sick with food poisoning and vomiting. Although, in one call he said that he and Nancy were at the hospital to be with Daniel who was hospitalized. Throughout he insisted that he would attend that live event in Houston.When he missed the live event on Sunday, and the WWE couldn't get hold of him, they contacted authorities. Police say that Benoit strangled his wife on Friday, smothered his son on late Friday or early Saturday, and then hanged himself inside his weight room on Sunday or Monday.The Wikinews investigation is unable to conclude whether the anonymous editors had inside information about the death of Nancy Benoit.This is not the first time Benoit's article has been edited to show false or unsourced information, as the article's edit history indicates a long history of promotional spam and vandalism. Around the time of the edits, the article contained a hidden warning to editors of the section mentioned, warning against adding rumours and speculations. For the time being, Benoit's article has been protected in an attempt to stop the addition of fraudulent information.London, England — Table tennis was in full swing at London's ExCeL North Arena 1 yesterday at the 2012 Summer Paraylympics, where Ying Zhou of China defeated Andreja Dolinar of Slovenia in straight sets with scores of 11–7, 11–5, and 11–7 in a game that lasted sixteen minutes total, with no individual set lasting longer than five minutes.

Gibbs also named Derek Crookes among three others who, he said, were involved in the affair. "Gibbs had come and the interrogation took place in a manner in which we wanted. The investigation can now move forward," Joint Commissioner of Crime Branch Ranjit Narayan said at a press conference following the two hour long session. Gibbs maintained that he did not know whether or not any Indian players were involved in the scandal, although he did reveal that the entire South African team had received an offer in 1996, which they refused. Gibbs also refrained from revealing whether or not he actually accepted any money to underperform, saying only that he was following his late skipper's wishes. Narayan, on his part, indicated that the investigation could now "move forward", following the filling-in of "loopholes and gaps" as a result of today's interrogation. The Delhi Police have also taken samples of Gibbs' voice to compare it with the telephone recordings that they have recovered.  The cops also stated that Gibbs had been cooperative, and that he "might be needed again".

Denny's Diner has promoted the iconic dish giveaway heavily, with a bold 30-second appeal ad that aired during the third quarter of the Super Bowl 43 on Sunday, plus another 15-second ad during the post-game show, offering a free breakfast to some 90 million viewers. In addition, it has placed a full-page ad in USA Today's Monday edition. The promotion was further announced on The Today Show and notices were also sent out to the chain's "Denny's Breakfast Club" members. The NBC ad, which was bought to unveil a new promotion for customers squeezed by the recession, may have cost as much as $3 million, said Nelson Marchioli, CEO of Denny's Corp. Super Bowl XLIII's 30-second commercial time slot costs $2.4 million–$3 million for the airtime alone, excluding production and talent costs. The game was televised live by the US NBC Sunday Night Football and Canada's CTV Television Network. BayTSP has reported that, "as of 10 a.m. Wednesday, commercials that initially aired during NBC's Super Bowl XLIII broadcast subsequently had been watched online more than 28 million times.""The promotion has a total cost of $5 million U.S., which includes $3 million for the commercial on NBC," said a Denny's spokesman, noting also that the company received about $50 million in news coverage, most of which was positive. According to a Denny's representative, two million people walked through the restaurant chains’ doors Tuesday, and each Denny’s restaurant served an average of 130 Grand Slams per hour.With the "Denny's Feeds America" promotion, the company has reported 14 million hits on its Web site between Sunday night and Monday morning. Denny's shares rose 6 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $1.98 in afternoon trading. The stock has traded in a range of $1.18 to $4.10 over the past 52 weeks. "Denny's free Grand Slam" has ranked in the top 10 Google searches early Tuesday and fell to No. 18 by the end of the promotion, while “denny s locations” was #9 on Google Trends, which tracks fast-rising searches. It has also held spots No. 1 (Denny's) and 7 (Grand Slam) on Twitter's trending topics. It has generated much chat on Twitter, garnering 1,700 tweets on Tuesday, compared with its average of 59. Doritos, winner of the USA TODAY survey for best Super Bowl spot ad, had 933 mentions after reaching a peak of almost 3,300. The idea of the TV ad was to get people to come in and re-evaluate Denny’s Diner. “A lot of people have forgotten what Denny’s is, or they think they know, while we’ve come out with a whole lot of new products. We felt like we needed to jump start the brand,” Denny’s Chief Marketing and Innovation Officer Mark Chmiel said. "We're celebrating the Grand Slam this year," Chmiel said. According to the company's financial data,  on January 15 Denny's reported systemwide comparable-store sales for the fourth quarter were down 6.1 percent, compared to a 0.2 percent decline from the same period in 2007.According to Robert Gonzalez, public relations company Hill & Knowlton spokesman, Denny's has expected at least 2 million people to eat a free Grand Slam by the end of the promotion. "Every restaurant is packed with people and lines," Gonzalez said. "Everything today is about fast. People are on the go, and they're eating fast food. It's cutting into sit-down dining," he added. "Each of the more than 1,500 Denny's were planning to make about 100 Grand Slams an hour," Denny's spokeswoman Cori Rice said. It had predicted it will have served about 1,400 people per location, more than five times the normal volume. "Grand Slam  Breakfast" is a four-item option on its menu, consisting of two pancakes, two eggs, two strips of bacon and two sausage links. It weighs in at 44 grams of fat, 56 carbohydrates and 770 calories.Nationwide, Denny's expected to sell about 2 million Grand Slams — about 15 percent of the annual tally. According to Mark Chmiel, chief marketing operator and executive vice president, the diner chain has reported approximately 2 million meals worth more than $12 million were given away nationwide and each Denny’s restaurant served an average of 130 Grand Slams per hour. It estimated it has earned about $50 million worth of public relations following the free Grand Slam campaign, Chmiel said. The company is also experimenting with a Grand Slam Burrito and also has introduced for this year, a Grand Slamwich, which includes eggs, bacon, sausage and cheese between two slices of bread, with a teaspoon serving. "It already has shown strong consumer appeal," said Chmiel. The company has received flood of e-mails and letters proving the positive impact of the Grand Slam campaign and commercials on its customers.Chmiel also announced he's planning a third major promotion in this year's third quarter, which happens to include another major sporting event, the World Series. "That's one we're definitely looking at," he said.Jobless Paris Winslow of downtown San Francisco, California has joined the long line which stretched from the front door on Mission Street, between Fourth and Fifth streets, to the corner of Fourth and up the block. "The economy is getting kind of scary. This line looks like those pictures of soup kitchen lines during the 1929 Great Depression," Winslow said."I came all the way from San Francisco for a free $6 meal, Isn't that pathetic? A year ago, I never would have done this. These days I'm willing to put my ego on the back burner," said Stephen Weller, a jobless contractor who waited with his dog, Emmett. California Denny's restaurant managers have  issued rain checks (for free chilled meals, as security backed by actual bacon) to anyone who failed to get in by the 2 p.m. deadline. A big eater could also "Slam It Up" by adding any two additional items for 99 cents each to their meal. Customers on Tuesday were also handed "bounceback" coupon books that include offers for additional free menu items with purchases. Chicago Tribune reporter Kevin Pang has eaten five free Grand Slams on Tuesday at five different Denny's Diners in four hours. He claims to have consumed 4,100 calories at Harwood Heights, 5:36 a.m, at Schiller Park, 6:22 a.m., at Franklin Park, 7:08 a.m., at Melrose Park, 7:41 a.m. and at Grand Slam No. 5 Oak Park, 8:57 a.m."The Grand Slam has always been a Denny's favorite. This free offer is our way of reacquainting America with Denny's real breakfast and with the Denny's brand," Denny's CEO Nelson Marchioli said in a statement. In 1977s, the Grand Slam started as a baseball-related promotion in Atlanta, Georgia. Its normal price averages around $5.99. Marchioli said the event was also a way to kick-off its "Year of the Grand Slam" promotion. Denny's claimed it has sold 12.5 million Grand Slams a year. "The economy's tough and people are jumping all the way to fast food to try to figure it out. We all use fast food, whether it's for time or convenience or for money. But you can go to Denny's and you don't have to give up a real breakfast and that was the whole focus of our commercial," Marchioli explained. McDonald's (MCD, Fortune 500) has done well during this economic meltdown since the global recession pushes people toward less expensive dining options. McDonald's has announced plans Wednesday to open 175 new restaurants in China this year despite the global economic crisis, thereby increasing the number of outlets in China by 17 percent, from 1,050 currently. Last month, McDonald's 2008 net profit has risen 80 percent from 2007 to 4.3 billion dollars.Marchioli has also introduced Denny's $4 Weekday Express Slam, which is a streamlined version of the Grand Slam. "I want to take back share. For too long, we have allowed others to take share, whether it was Starbucks or McDonald's. They're fine competitors and I don't expect to take all their business from them, but I'd like a little bit back," Marchioli noted.According to Rafi Mohammed, author of "The Art of Pricing," people love free. "It triggers a Pavlovian response in people," said Mohammed. If Pavlov's dogs salivate when a bell rings, Denny's free Grand Slam breakfast has attracted 2 million hungry customers. "I believe free maximizes trial and doesn't devalue a product as long as it is a rare event. Aside from the cost, the major downside is that it attracts customers who truly have no intention of coming back," he added.According to University of Portland consumer psychology professor Deana Julka, people flock to free promotions amid just a few dollars saving because there's nothing in life for free. "So when there's something out there that costs nothing, it creates a psychological rush. Especially in these times when people feel overtaxed or overburden, there's an internal reward people feel by getting something for free," she said. "It's being thrifty and feeling like you beat the system. Free really hits the spot for a lot of people," Julka added."Free is an emotional hot button. When free is concerned, there is no downside - or, at least, we don't see the downside immediately. So we overvalue everything that is free. People love free stuff, particularly when money's tight," said Dan Ariely, a business professor at Duke University, author of "Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions."Experts, however, explained these moves need to be done sparingly, since giveaways can teeter in the balance between desperation and a well designed marketing ploy. "Giving your product away for free is not worth it because it undermines your brand value," said branding expert Rob Frankel, saying people are attached to the idea of it being free, than the actual product itself. Free giveaways are not anything new in the food industry. "It just feels good when you can get something for free and not have to worry about it coming out of your wallet," Frankel noted. Dunkin' Donuts and Panera Bread all have had free coffee and food promos last year. "In November, Starbucks gave away free cup of coffee to anyone who came in on Election Day. Have you taken a look at how Starbucks is doing now?" Last week it has announced it would shut down 300 stores, in addition to the 600 it already planned to close.On February 24, IHOP will be offering a free shortstack to every customer to encourage donations (in place of the cost) for Childrens Miracle Network. The International House of Pancakes (IHOP) is a United States-based restaurant chain that specializes in breakfast foods and is owned by DineEquity. The chain had more than 1950 restaurants in all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada and Mexico. Since 2006, IHOP's National Pancake Day celebration has raised over $1.85 million. In 2008, over 1.5 million pancakes (12 miles high if they were stacked) were given to customers for donations.Denny's ("Denny's Diner") is a full-service diner/family restaurant chain in the United States. It operates over 2,500 restaurants in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Curaçao, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, and New Zealand). The resto chain is known for always being open, serving breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert around the clock.Today, Denny's operates about 1,600 restaurants in all 50 U.S. states, Canada and Mexico. There are also about 578 Denny's restaurants in Japan operated under a license by a subsidiary of Seven & I Holdings, seven Denny's locations in New Zealand, and approximately 38 Denny's diners in the United States. Denny's headquarters is now located in Spartanburg, South Carolina, headquarters of the parent company Trans World Corporation that acquired Denny's in 1987.Denny's was historically notable for offering a free meal to anyone on their birthday. The offer included a limited number of meal options from a special birthday menu. The promotional ritual ceased in 1993, though occasionally individual franchises will continue the tradition. In 2008, Denny's has ceased to be in the ranks among the top diner chains in the $83 billion breakfast market, whose top five firms -- McDonald's, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, Burger King and IHOP -- accounted for 22 percent of the volume. "A lot of consumers have written Denny's off their let's-go-there list," said Ron Paul, president of Technomic, a consulting firm.

In college, he became only the 12th player in SEC history to collect more than 2,700 receiving yards.McKinley has become the third young Broncos player to die in recent years. Darrent Williams was shot dead on New Year's Eve in 2007 and Damien Nash died after he collapsed during a charity basketball game a month later. ESPN's Adam Schefter said on his twitter page "No NFL team has been hit harder than Denver. Darrent Williams, Damien Nash. Kenny McKinley. RIP."The Denver Bulldogs have defeated the Seattle Grizzlies to win the 2009 United States Australian Football League (USFooty) National Championships - the clubs seventh since 2000. In what was described as a close, hard fought game, the final scores ended with Denver 2-5 (17) defeating Seattle 2-2 (14).Denver (3-0-0 12pts) knocked off Golden Gate (2-0-1 8pts) for a spot in the final by defeating reigning champions Vancouver by 52 points in the last game of the group stage. Seattle (2-0-1) managed to get through on percentage only over New York (2-0-1).Seattle were playing in Division 1 this year after defeating Calgary by 19 points in the 2008 Division 2 final. Without Seattle, Calgary won the Division 2 title. Division 3 was won by Dallas , Ohio Valley/St Louis won Division 4 and Calgary Blue took the Women's final. While Australian rules football is generally played on a field 170 metres by 160 metres, the fields used for the event were "150 yards long and 110 wide". The two teams consist of 18 players a side. Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total). Games lasted for two twenty minute halves as opposed to four twenty minute quarters normally played.Baltimore/Washington fielded a team in both Division 1 and in Division 4."Division IV has eight teams that are largely combined squads - although the Baltimore/Washington Eagles are sending a full B squad that will require no combining with extras from other teams," said USFooty media spokesman Kevin Smith.USFooty president Rich Mann told Wikinews that NFL style competition with six or seven teams was possible.More details have emerged over the weekend after the surprise announcement last week of Honda's intention to sell its Formula One racing team, Honda Racing F1. The team management, Nick Fry and Ross Brawn, have already announced confidence in their ability not only to find a buyer for the team but also to deliver the performance expected of Honda's 2009 car. Prices as low as £1 have been put forward as possible prices tags for the Northampton based team, with Honda CEO Takeo Fukui stating that "Just to make the team possible to exist, a small price tag is acceptable".On Saturday the Japanese car giant said that before selling the team it was going to offer British driver Jensen Button, who had given the Honda team its only victory, a way out of his recently signed multi-million pound contract with the team so he could try to get a drive with other teams. However, Ross Brawn appears eager to retain the Briton and either retain Brazilian Rubens Barrichello or sign GP2 driver Bruno Senna, nephew of legendary racer Ayrton Senna. At an industry awards dinner, Button indicated his desire for a buyer to be found for Honda, saying any buyer would get "... a great team with excellent facilities. And with the leadership of Ross Brawn, and the whole team as they are, we can come through this and be on the grid in 2009". Button has also spoken of his shock and pain at Honda's decision.Ross Brawn, who was brought into the Honda team with much fan fare before the 2008 season, has spoken of his shock at finding out about the sale of the team. Brawn, who is credited with helping Michael Schumacher and Ferrari dominate Formula One for much of the last decade, indicated he was expected funding cuts and had prepared a reduced budget but hadn't expected the full withdrawal of support that Honda announced. Brawn has also indicated understanding of Honda's reasoning, with their sales down 40% in some markets and Honda F1's £200m+ budget a cost they were unwilling to bear.Though Honda has committed to providing a budget for the team until March, the budget is lower than that which had been expected and so the team has had to pull out of the crucial winter tests at Jerez. This has denied Formula One hopeful Bruno Senna another test with the team and has combined with the engine implications of Honda's withdrawal to push the new car's final testing from January to March, just weeks before the first Grand Prix in Australia. Ross Brawn however remains confident of competing with new Formula One frontrunners BMW Sauber and Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has tipped the team as a great buy, saying "I've no doubt Honda would have been in top four next year without any problems. They've spent a lot of money to put themselves in that position so if anyone does want to be in F1 this is a team they should look to buy. It's a big opportunity for any company that's run efficiently to benefit".The Detroit Lions held a press conference this afternoon at their headquarters in Allen Park, MI to announce the termination of head coach Steve Mariucci, as well as offensive assistant coaches Pat Morris and Andy Sugarman, according to the Associated Press.

"I think Ray Allen had a heck of a shooting night," James said after being presented the award.A strong defensive display and two well taken goals saw Ecuador beat Poland in the second Group A match at the soccer World Cup. The thousands of Polish fans who had traveled to the Veltins-Arena stadium in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, saw their team struggle to put together attacking plays.Ecuador, whose captain and defender Ivan Hurtado was taken off injured on 67 minutes, scored a goal in the first half and one ten minutes from the end for a 2-0 victory.The first twenty minutes was cagey with both sides unable to find form; there was not one chance on goal for the first twenty minutes.When one did come it was Ecuador who capitalised: a throw-in from the right into the penalty area was flicked on for Carlos Tenario to nod passed the outstretched fingers of Artur Boruc into the far corner of the Polish net.While first half-possession was equal for both sides Poland dominated the second period as Ecuador sat back on their lead, content to hit on the break.Poland continued their early form of choosing the wrong pass and many times lost the ball in the third of the pitch nearest the opposition goal.Ecuador scored a second ten minutes from time; in a rare attack near the Polish goal the ball was threaded by Polish defenders leaving a two on one with a stranded Boruc.Agustin Delgardo didn't miss from ten yards.The Polish game never got going for manager Pawel Janas until the last five minutes when they hit the horizontal and then the vertical whitework of Christian Mora's goal.Much of the credit for the performance of Luis Suarez's Ecuador side must be put at the feet of their defenders, particularly Giovanny Espinoza and Ivan Hurtado.He will be hoping his defensive leader recovers for the next game against Costa Rica while Poland must contend with a German side who won their first game of the World Cup, Friday.Middlesex batsman Ed Joyce will replace Marcus Trescothick in the England Cricket squad facing Australia in the first Ashes test at the Gabba in Brisbane on 23 November. The Irish-born left-handed batsman has only played three one-day internationals and one Twenty20 for England, averaging 10.33. Joyce was chosen over Owais Shah and Rob Key; who have both had test experience for England, with Rob Key playing for the losing 2002/03 tourists at the last Ashes series in Australia.England squad to face Australia:A Flintoff  (captain)AJ Strauss (vice-captain)JM AndersonIR BellPD CollingwoodAN CookAF GilesSJ HarmisonMJ HoggardGO Jones (wicketkeeper)EC JoyceSI MahmoodMS PanesarKP PietersenLE PlunkettCMW Read (wicketkeeper)The New Zealand Government has announced that it is ditching its preferred option of building a new stadium on Auckland's waterfront and instead is going to upgrade Auckland's current stadium of Eden Park for the 2011 Rugby World Cup final that New Zealand is hosting.The decision is only if Eden Park can do a "...redevelopment design, and on governance and funding issues going forward, with a report back to Cabinet by December 13. This report back date will not affect building timelines," Trevor Mallard, minister for sport, said.The waterfront stadium was to cost NZ$497 million compared to the upgrade of Eden Park which will cost $385 million.John Alexander, chief executive of Eden Park, said: "This decision is the right one for Auckland and for New Zealand. The Eden Park of 2011 will make Auckland and New Zealand proud. Not only will it preserve our rich sporting and social history, and provide sports viewing of an international quality, our plans will put the Park back into Eden Park."Mr Mallard said: "The decision on a stadium had always been one for Auckland to make but unfortunately Auckland has been unable to agree to a preference, with Auckland City Council in favour of a waterfront site, and the Auckland Regional Council not favouring such a site."The North Harbour stadium has been announced as the back up option, "It has also been agreed that North Harbour be considered as a reserve option for the time being..." Mr Mallard said."Cabinet today considered two options given this lack of unanimity - either to convene a group of all key parties to see whether issues with the waterfront could be overcome, or to support a redevelopment of Eden Park, which was the Auckland City Council's second option, subject to further work," Mr Mallard said."Cabinet decided to explore an alternative stadium site after it became clear - in August - that the cost of an Eden Park redevelopment had gone from around $150 million when the hosting bid was won, to an estimated $320 million. The latest Eden Park version is estimated to cost $385 million. If the government had been advised of the escalation of these costs earlier, then the timeframe would not have been so tight, and the process of evaluating options and consultation would have been much different," Trevor Mallard noted.The racehorse Efficient has won the 2007 Melbourne Cup. Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, Australia was abuzz today as the Melbourne Cup was raced for the 147th time. The New Zealand horse Efficient finishing the 3200m race in a time of 3:23.24. The horse, which had won the 2006 Victorian Derby, became the first horse since Phar Lap (also a New Zealand horse) to come back and win the Melbourne Cup a year later.The race ended with a stunning finish as Efficient and his jockey Michael Rodd came from behind to overtake Purple Moon in the final stretch. The odds on Efficient were 24-1 to win and A$7.40 for a place. Purple Moon finished second and Mahler finished third.120,000 spectators looked on as Mahler took the lead at 1600m and fell back to third in the closing stages. Early leader Tungsten Strike finished 21st (last).The win is the third of its kind for owner Lloyd Williams with two previous victories in the 1980s. Williams had two horses in the race, Zipping and Efficient, but Zipping fell to fourth place while Efficient surged forward. Lloyd Williams' son Nick was at the raceground and was aiming high for Efficient. "People keep telling me the last horse to do what he has done was Phar Lap," he said.Efficient was a favourite for the 2006 Melbourne Cup but was scratched at the last minute.The Egyptian national football team became Africa Cup of Nations champions for the sixth time in the history of the competition by beating the national team of Cameroon 1-0 in the Ohene Djan Stadium, Ghana.Mohamed Aboutreika scored the only goal in the game in the 77th minute after Cameroon failed to clear the ball from their area under a period of heavy attacking play. This was Aboutreika's 34th international goal for his country and was driven into the bottom corner of the net from a distance of 16yds. Egypt's victory closes the tournament, the 26th occasion the trophy has been contested, which began on 20 January 2008 and was hosted by Ghana. Ghana's national team came third overall with Côte d'Ivoire taking fourth place in the final standings. Cameroon and FC Barcelona player Samuel Eto'o was the tournament's highest goalscorer with 5 goals.El Salvador has been suspended from competing in all world football internationals.  FIFA, the governing body in football, suspended the Salvadorian Football Association (FESFUT) over government involvement.  The Salvadorian government refused to recognise local football officials that FIFA had appointed. Last year, the head of the Salvadorian Football Association, Rodrigo Calvo, resigned.  FIFA stepped in and appointed a special commission to reform the finances of the association.  However, Salvadorian president Mauricio Funes refused to recognize the commission.  FIFA considered this political interference. The suspension affects next month's World Cup in South Africa.  Despite the national team not qualifying, three referees have been selected to participate in the tournament.  If the suspension is not overturned by the start of the tournament, they will not be able to participate. A meeting of an executive commission is due to take place on June 8; should the El Salvadorian government not change its stance on the issue, the suspension will be finalised.  If the government does not change its stance, El Salvador will remain suspended for the entire year until the FIFA congress meets again in June 2011.The interview below was conducted by Pingswept over the phone with Emily Levan on April 21, 2005. Levan lives in Wiscasset, Maine, with her husband and daughter, and she ran in the Boston Marathon women's race on April 18, 2005.To summarize for our readers, you recently came in 12th in the Boston Marathon, right?That is correct.You were the first American finisher.Yes.There was also a Russian woman who lives in the US who finished ahead of you.You know, I believe it is, I'm not actually positive, but I think you're right. There's often a lot of foreign runners that live and train in different parts of the US for a variety of reasons. Some live in Colorado and might train at high altitude, or they might have coaches in the US.OK, but as far as you know, for straight up Americans, people who were born here, who have lived here for long periods of time and are not going anywhere special to train, you were the first finisher.That is correct.So congratulations, that's very impressive. In the rest of your life, my understanding is that you are going to nursing school.I am. I'm at the University of Southern Maine in Portland. and I have been going to nursing school for a couple years now. I'm just going part time right now because of the baby and other things going on in my world.Your baby is currently one and a half?She's fifteen months.Fifteen months, so one and one quarter. 1.25, sure.Hopefully I'll finish up nursing school in December. That is the tentative plan.So you're almost done.I just have a couple classes left.I'll take one class this summer and two classes in the fall.You ran the Boston Marathon originally two years ago?Actually, I ran it for the first time in 99. I've run it four times.I did run it two years ago as well.You ran it two years ago, and you also came in twelfth then, if not the top American finisher then. You were the fourth?I think third or fourth. I can't remember exactly.How long were you actually training for this marathon in particular?I'd say about 4 months. I typically try to train about four months for each race. It depends a little bit on what kind of shape I'm in leading up to the training. Four months is usually the time frame I shoot for.And how many miles a week were you doing--I assume you peaked somewhere right before the marathon.At the peak, I have a month or six week period where I've built up to my peak training, and I was probably doing between 90 to 100 miles a week.Was there a lot of variation in your day to day mileage, or was it pretty much you're doing 1/7th of that mileage every day?There's definitely variation, probably more so in the type of workout that i did each day. For example two days a week I would do a speed workout, so I might be doing mile repeats, which just means that I do a mile in a specific time, and then I might jog for a couple minutes and then another one and another one. I'd do a series of eight mile repeats on that specific workout day. My other speed workout would be a marathon pace run, so I might run 8 or 10 miles at my marathon pace. If my marathon pace is 6 minute miles, I'd do a two mile jog warm up, and then I might do 8 or 10 miles at a six minute pace, and then a two mile cool down.So you maybe end up running 14?Sometimes what I would do on those speed workout days-- on those days I might end up with about 14 miles. On some other days, I might run twice during the course of the day. Say in the morning, I might run eight miles, and then in the afternoon I might do six or eight more miles.Wow.Those days tend to be a little bit more mellow. More of kind of a maintenance run, a little bit of a recovery day. I try to have a recovery day after every hard workout.Do you think that all of your training could fit into four hours a day? Do you think that's true?You mean the workouts for a specific day? Probably even less than that. Depending on the day a little bit, probably between 2 or 3 hours. Usually on Sunday I would go out and do a long run, and that would be a 20 or 22 mile run, all in one fell swoop and that usually takes two and a half hours.So that explains how you're able to do this, as well as go to nursing school, as well as have an extremely young child. I assume you talk to your friends occasionally.I try to at least-- have some sort of social life. This is not a job, so it's not something that I do 8 hours a day. It's something that I fit in with all the other obligations, things that I like to do too. I like to be able to pursue other interests as well.You live on a road with no one else near by. Do you pretty much just run from your house every day?The winter is harder because with the baby, I often end up running with a treadmill down in the basement. Brad, my husband, has pretty long hours at the farm, and especially in the winter months, it's hard to find daylight when he's able to watch Maddy, so I ended up running a lot on the treadmill this winter, as opposed to last summer, I would take her with me. I have one of those baby joggers, and that was great. I could just leave right from the house, and I could take her. She would be pretty happy to go eight or ten miles with me. Typically what I do when I go outside, I just go right from the house. The roads are so pretty around here. We're pretty secluded, so I don't have to worry too much about crazy drivers.Do you ever try to go find big hills to run up and down?I do. In the past, I have done a hill workout as a part of my training, usually early on in the training during the first six weeks or 2 months of the training I do a hill workout and I would find some place close by that I could find a warm up jog and run to and then do a hill workout. If I couldn't find one within a couple miles, I would drive to it. It's a little bit harder now with Maddy because I don't have as much leeway and freedom with when I go running and where I go running. I'm a little more limited.You'd have to load up the cart, er, the carriage into the car.I've done that sometimes. Sometimes it's easier to go straight from home.Running with the jogger up hills is not an easy thing to do.When you're in the race, you feel like, “Hey, I'm not even pushing a kid anymore.” Heartbreak Hill without the kid is substantially easier, I suppose.Yeah.Do you know most of the elite runners in the race? You know who they are, but are you friends with them, or not really?It's funny--I know who people are, but I don't run that many races to really get to know that many of the runners. If you're a professional runner, and that's your job, a lot of those people travel in the same circles. They run the same races and they have the same schedules in terms of when they compete. I pick out a couple of races each year to focus on and because of that, I don't get to know as many of the runners. As time goes on, you do get a little bit you do get a little more familiar with people.During the race, do you talk to the other runners, or do you just run along and think things like, “I wish I were at the end right now”?I think that really depends I find that if I'm feeling good and the run is going well, then it's easier for me to talk to people, just because you're feeling strong, and you're not focusing so much on “I'm not doing so great.” I might talk to some folks along the way. Sometimes if someone passes me, I'll encourage them and say “Good job, go get them,” and just stuff like that. I certainly find I'm not carrying on lengthy conversations with people because you're expending energy that should be focused on the race itself. I enjoy getting to know folks along the way and knowing what pace they're hoping to run.In races other than the Boston Marathon do you find that you have good competition? I don't really know what the running scene in Wiscasset, Maine, is like at all, but I imagine that being the fastest female marathon runner in the United States, you might not find a whole lot of competition. You say that you encourage people when they pass you, but having read some of the other interviews with you on the web, it doesn't seem like people pass you very often.It definitely depends on the race. Like I said before, I don't run that many races. At this point, what I'm trying to do is to find races that are competitive so I can be pushed by competition. For example, when I ran the Maine Marathon last fall, there wasn't a whole lot of competition. That just gets hard. I ran alone for most of the race. Running 26 miles at a fast pace all by yourself without anyone around you to help push you and motivate you, can be pretty hard. Because of that, as I've been looking toward the future and thinking about which races I want to do, I've been targeting races that will have a little more competition. That's why Boston was one that I wanted to shoot for and I'm thinking about in the fall going to Chicago because they've got a pretty competitive marathon. It's also a pretty flat course, so people tend to run pretty fast times there.Most people run a couple of minutes faster in Chicago, right?Yeah, exactly. And I've heard good things about the race too, so I'm looking forward to that.Have you thought about running internationally?Not at this point, no. It's hard to find the time to travel to races, and It gets expensive too. A lot of my family members say, “Wouldn't it be great to do the London Marathon or the Paris Marathon,” because they like coming to watch. At this point, I think I'm going to stick closer to home. I've got a few races, like I was mentioning Chicago, here in the States that I'd really like to do. Maybe once I've done those, I might think about something else, it really just depends. A lot of it's a time issue, because I have other things that I'm pursuing and it gets hard to spend too much time traveling off doing different races.Do you know Alan Culpepper?Oh, yeah, yeah.You at least know of him, right?Yes, exactly.Have you ever been in any races against him?This was the first race that I had run in that he ran in. He was the fourth overall male finisher. That's a really good showing for an American male. I've read a lot about him in different running magazines and just heard a lot about him through running circles.But this was the first time that I've actually seen him run. It was neat because in this particular race, they start the women's elite group about 25 minutes ahead of the rest of the start.29 minutes actually, I believe.That's right, 29 minutes. So, I didn't see a male runner until pretty close to the end, so it was really neat to see--I think I saw the top five male finishers because they passed me in the last couple miles. It was really interesting--there's all these cars and press and motorcycles, policemen, so I could tell when the first male was coming up behind me because there was a lot more going on on the course. Alan Culpepper was one of the ones that passed me in the last mile or two. It was pretty neat to see him finishing strong.You might not be able to beat him in a race but do you think you could maybe, I don't know, beat him in a fist fight? He's pretty skinny, right? He only weighs 130 pounds.I don't know. I don't know. I wouldn't make any bets on it at this point.No?No.OK. Have you thought about doing things longer than a marathon? Like a 50 K or a 100 K?At this point, I haven't because I've gotten into the marathon, and I've really been enjoying that so far. I feel like I still have some room to improve and grow in the marathon, but I think at some point I'd really like to do one of those ultra-type races. For the next several years, I'll stick towards the marathon distances. Once that competitive part of my life is over, I might move on to something different.Based on your age, are you likely to peak around now, or you maybe have a few years to go before your legs start to fall off?Before I can't walk anymore? I don't know. It's really interesting because for marathoning you've got a longer life span than in a lot of competitive sports. The fifth place female finisher in Boston this year was over forty. You can still be competitive into your forties. I'm not sure if I'll keep doing it that long-- at least another 3 years or so. One thing in the back of my mind looking at is the Olympic Trials for 2008. I'm looking at that time frame right now. If I want to keep running competitively after that, then I'll assess things from there.That sounds good. When you came in as the first American finisher, did you get any certificates or cash or a medal or anything like that?Yeah, actually, I won $2100.Oh, great-- two thousand bucks!Which is pretty nice.That's a lot of baby clothes.I know-- or a lot of shoes. The shoe expense is pretty expensive, and I've been trying to find a shoe company that might give me some shoes.I would think--couldn't you just call up New Balance and say, “Hey, look, I'm pretty good, why don't you give me some shoes?”Well, this past November, after I ran New York-- I usually wear Asics or New Balance-- I wrote to both of those companies. I sent them a little running resume. I said I'd be interested in pursuing some sort of sponsorship opportunity, and they both wrote back and said, “Sorry, we don't have any space or funds available at this time.” I was a little disappointed by that, because I was hoping to at least get someone to help me out with my shoes.Yeah, at least some sneakers.But in addition at Boston, they do have these crystal vases that they give out for the top 15 finishers, so I got a little piece of hardware there too.So you get to put flowers in that.I had some flowers in it; they've wilted so I decided to compost them.Oh, that's good.Yeah, send them back to the earth, you know.Has anyone else tried to interview you? Local paparazzi following you?I hide in my car for most of the day. I did some local interviews--with the local NBC affiliate, and I'm going to do an interview tomorrow with the ABC affiliate in Portland, and some affiliated newspaper interviews as well.You're officially famous, then.I don't know. I guess. It's been pretty busy.Has anyone asked you for an autograph yet?No. No autograph seekers yet, no.Maybe in the Yellowfront Grocery in Wiscasset? “Hey, I know you!”“I saw you on TV!” No, not yet.That's surely coming. The Chewonki Foundation, which is where you live, recently had Eaton Farm donated to it.Yes.And they're planning on making a 12 mile long trail that runs from approximately your house to Wiscasset.Oh, you know more about this than I do, that's great.I don't know if it's going to start right at your front door; you might have to cut through the woods a little bit.That's OK, I can do that.Have you run on trails at all, or is it just, “I want to run on the pavement because I don't want to twist an ankle”?I'm not a big trail runner. Maybe it's because I'm not used to running on trails. Now it would be much more difficult, because I have the baby with me. The baby jogger has some nice wheels on it, but I don't know if it could handle trail running.Yeah.It's a nice change of pace every once in a while. I don't worry too much about twisting an ankle--you just have to be careful. I figure I can walk out my door and step in a pothole and twist my ankle, so I don't worry too much about that. That goes along with being alive in our world. We'll see. I'm going to have to look into that 12 mile trail.Because 12 miles, you do that there and back, you've got a marathon on your hands.There you go.What's your next target? Can you walk right now?If I train well, I'm usually not sore. Especially on the long runs, my body gets used to running for that length of time and sure, I'm running faster during the marathon than I do on my long runs, but I think my body tends to adjust to the rigors. It's usually a good sign if a few days afterwards I don't have any major soreness. I certainly feel like I've done something significant.Yeah, I can imagine feeling too.No major aches or pains.That's great. What's your next race? Do you have one targeted? Is it Chicago?Yeah, I think the next marathon will be Chicago in the fall. there's a 10 K race, the Beach to Beacon, you may have heard of it.In Portland?It's actually in Cape Elizabeth. It's put on by Joan Benoit Samuelson. It's in August, so I'll probably do that one and then shoot for the fall marathon.Well, I think that's all my questions.Nice, well, thanks for calling. I appreciate it.Sure, well, thanks for running so fast.No problem.The Empire State Games is an annual Olympic-style competition for amateur athletes from the state of New York, United States, encompassing several divisions allowing athletes of all ages to compete. In 2007, it is hosted by Westchester County and takes place July 25-29, 2007. In all, some 6,000 athletes are expected to participate."I think the Empire State Games is one of the best things that's happened to Westchester County," Buster LaBarbera, 74, of New Rochelle said. "It's good for the economy and it's just a great thing."Long Island had made a bid to host the games but lost out to Westchester. "Once done, it's done," said Bob Kenney, region director for Long Island, at the opening ceremonies. "We can't look back. We can't hold grudges." Long Island may submit a bid for the games in 2010 according to Kenney.Saturday, the Criterium cycling events took place in White Plains.

The final line up was confirmed after the final set of the Super-Six matches yesterday when New Zealand defeated Pakistan by 223 runs. The other two matches between Australia and England ended with Australia beating England by 8 wickets and India beating the West Indies by 8 wickets as well.The final will be a repeat of the 1993 world cup final held in England. England beat New Zealand in the 1993 final at Lord's, London by 67 runs to win the tournament. The final of the 2009 tournament will be held on March 22nd at the North Sydney Oval, North Sydney. Before that, on March 21st, the 3rd place playoff between Australia and India will be played at Bankstown Oval, Sydney and the 5th place playoff between West Indies and Pakistan will be played at Drummoyne Oval, Sydney.England have beaten India by 104 runs in the first One-Day International of the Indian tour of England at the Rose Bowl, Hampshire, England.England's batsmen started quietly, reaching 43-1 in the eleventh over when Matt Prior was caught off Zaheer Khan's bowling. Alastair Cook and Ian Bell shared a 178-run partnership, with Cook reaching his maiden one-day century before being bowled by Yuvraj Singh. Soon afterwards, Bell reached his first one-day century, and finished the innings on 126 not out. Kevin Pietersen added 33 runs off 25 balls and England finished their 50 overs with a score of 288-2.In response, the Indian batsmen struggled. Sourav Ganguly was run out by Monty Panesar early in the innings. Soon afterwards James Anderson claimed his 100th ODI wicket when Gautam Gambhir was caught behind to leave India on 19-2. Anderson then took two wickets in one over when Sachin Tendulkar was caught by Ravi Bopara at mid-wicket and Yuvraj Singh was caught by Cook for a duck. Rahul Dravid and Mahendra Singh Dhoni steadied the India innings with a partnership of 68 runs, but Dhoni was caught behind off Andrew Flintoff, who returned to the England side after a period of injury. Rahul Dravid scored 46 before being dismissed by Dimitri Mascarenhas, taking his first one-day wicket. Dinesh Karthik scored 44 not out and Zaheer Khan hit 20, including two sixes, but India were bowled out for 184, far short of the 289 run target. James Anderson was the pick of the England bowlers, taking 4-23. England lead the seven-match series 1-0. The second ODI will take place at the County Ground, Bristol, on 24 August. Earlier in the month, India won a three-match Test series 1-0.Toss: India won, and chose to field first.Fall of wickets: 1-43 (Prior, 10.5 ov), 2-221 (Cook, 41.4 ov)Did not bat: P D Collingwood, A Flintoff, R S Bopara, A D Mascarenhas, S C J Broad, J M Anderson, M S PanesarFall of wickets: 1-15 (Ganguly, 2.3 ov), 2-19 (Gambhir, 5.6 ov), 3-34 (Tendulkar, 11.1 ov), 4-34 (Yuvraj Singh, 11.5 ov), 5-102 (Dhoni, 30.3 ov), 6-105 (Dravid, 31.4 ov), 7-129 (Agarkar, 38.5 ov), 8-145 (Piyush Chawla, 42.1 ov), 9-183 (Khan, 48.3 ov), 10-184 (Singh, 49.6 ov)England: A N Cook, M J Prior (wkt), I R Bell, K P Pietersen, P D Collingwood (capt), A Flintoff, R S Bopara, A D Mascarenhas, S C J Broad, J M Anderson, M S PanesarIndia: S R Tendulkar, S C Ganguly, G Gambhir, R Dravid (capt), Yuvraj Singh, K D Karthik, M S Dhoni (wkt), Piyush Chawla, A B Agarkar, R P Singh, Z KhanMan of the Match: I R Bell (England)Umpires: M R Benson and B R Doctrove (West Indies)TV Umpire: I J GouldMatch Referee: R S Mahanama (Sri Lanka)Reserve Umpire: N J LlongEngland have defeated Australia in the final of the 2010 Twenty20 Cricket World Cup to win the tournament. England won by 7 wickets at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados to lift the World Cup. A 111 run partnership between Craig Kieswetter, the man of the match and Kevin Pietersen, the man of the tournament, helped them in chasing down the target of 148 runs set by Australia.England won the toss and opted to field. Australia scored 147 runs, losing 6 wickets in their twenty overs. David Hussey was the top scorer, getting 59 runs. Australia scored only 47 runs for 4 wickets in their first ten overs. David Hussey and Cameron White added 22 runs in the thirteenth over, thus helping their team to get to 147 for 6 in their innings. For England, Ryan Sidebottom took two wickets for 26 runs in four overs.Early in England's innings, Dirk Nannes of Australia took the wicket of Michael Lumb of England, when the latter was caught by David Hussey at mid-wicket. Kevin Pietersen of England came when Lumb got out, and helped England to reach 44 runs in the six powerplay overs. The partnership between Pietersen and Kieswetter helped their team to reach the target of 148 runs in seventeen overs, with three overs in hand.England captain Paul Collingwood told the media  that he thought "belief ha[d] been the key." "As soon as we got the squad together, seeing how much power we have in the squad, I know that is all on paper but we could tell that we had a lot of potential," he commented."I think a lot of credit goes to every single player in the dressing room to have the confidence to go out there and really give it their best shots and have no regrets. I think we have done that throughout the tournament and it has certainly paid off," he noted.For England, this is the first victory in a limited overs championship as they had never won a single one-day or T20 World Cup or the Championship League tournament till this victory. In this connection, all-rounder Collingwood said: "[t]his is right up there, with the best," adding "[t]o be the first [England] team to win a 'World Cup' is very special. We knew it was a monkey on our back."Meanwhile, Australian captain Michael Clarke admitted his disappointment at the result. He conceded that his performance was poor, saying, "There's no doubt the selectors will need to have a look at my performances. I certainly know they haven't been up to scratch through this whole tournament and probably in Twenty20 cricket in general. I'm sure the selectors will sit down and have a look and if I'm not the right guy for No 3 and the captaincy then they'll make that decision"Newly elected UK Prime Minister David Cameron praised the English team. "Congratulations to Paul Collingwood and the England Twenty20 team on becoming world champions for the first time with a magnificent victory over Australia. Let's hope this marks the start of a great summer of sport for England," he said. The English Sports Minister Hugh Robertson commented: "I'm absolutely delighted England have won the World Twenty20. They have played exciting and intelligent cricket and are worthy winners."On Saturday, England defeated two-time world champion Germany by 1–0 in the third place playoff in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, which was held in Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Alberta in Canada, and won the bronze medal.Germany had a greater possession of the ball against England in the match.

Silences were held at football games throughout the country over the weekend, with fans creating makeshift shrines at Newcastle United and Ipswich Town, the two clubs he was most strongly associated with.Today Robson's widow was moved to tears when she visited the shrine created by over 50,000 fans at Newcastle. She went on to express her gratitude to the generosity and affection of fans who have since Friday raised over £2,000,000 for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, the cancer charity founded by her late husband. At Ipswich fans hope to rename one of the stands at Portman Road after their former manager.Despite failing to win any major trophies with the national team. Bobby Robson was one of the most successful and best loved England managers.  His team  infamously lost a penalty shoot out to West Germany for a place in the finals of the 1990 World Cup.Robson was picked for the position of England manager after a 13 year spell at Ipswich Town enabling them to become league runners up twice and to win the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup. Following the decision by the Football Association to not renew his contract after the 1990 World Cup, Robson won honours in club football with PSV Eindhoven, FC Porto, and FC Barcelona.  His success as a manager has been put down to a great tactical brain and the ability to get the best out of his players, not least through his respect and generosity of spirit towards them.Robson will be remembered for his humour, his integrity, and his love of a game that he relished from childhood visits to his beloved Newcastle, a team he was later to manage.  He died at the age of 76 after a long battle with cancer, and leaves behind his wife of 54 years Elsie and their sons Andrew, Paul, and Mark.England squared the Ashes series against Australia by holding on for a 2 run victory at Edgbaston in Birmingham.Australia came close to victory themselves, however Steven Harminson took the wicket of Michael Kasprovic to clinch victory on the fourth day of the game. The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.Scores: England 407 and 182, Australia 308 and 279England beat New Zealand in the final of the 2009 Women's World Cup tournament at North Sydney Oval, North Sydney in Australia to win the title for the third time.

This is England's first World Cup win after their triumph in the 1993 World Cup final.The English Football Association (FA) has complained after broadcaster ITV cut away to an advertisement just before a winning goal in a match.The match, an FA Cup Merseyside derby between Everton F.C. and Liverpool F.C., was in extra time after 118 minutes without a goal when ITV's automated advertisement server, designed for use only during ordinary programming, began playing out commercials. During this time, Everton's Dan Gosling scored the winning goal. In some regions the system returned to the match just before the goal, but viewers in the south of England saw only the celebrations after the goal.Michael Grade, executive chairman of ITV, admitted to ITN that the broadcast had been a shambles and said that "yellow or red cards" would go to those responsible once it was established how it happened. ITV has received over 1,000 complaints. ITV has previously had issues with FA Cup coverage. The Histon F.C.—Leeds United A.F.C. game managed to include swearing from Leeds fans and scenes of a naked player, whilst heavy rain marred picture quality.The FA's statement on this issue said "It is obviously very disappointing that viewers and fans did not see the only goal of last night’s FA Cup replay between Everton and Liverpool. Clearly we are seeking a full explanation from ITV as to why this happened. It is important that lessons are learned and that this does not happen again".Yesterday, English football player Wayne Rooney announced retirement from international football via his official website.In his official statement, Rooney, who left Manchester United to join Everton FC last month, said it was time to "bow out" and wanted to "focus all my energies on helping them [Everton FC] be successful." Rooney announced his decision just after England's manager Gareth Southgate called him on phone asking him to play in the upcoming matches against Malta and Slovakia. Rooney said he had "already thought long and hard" to retire from international duties.In 2003, Rooney made his international debut in a friendly match against Australia at the age of seventeen, becoming then-youngest player to play for England. Since then, Rooney has won 119 international caps with England. Only Peter Shilton has more appearances for the Three Lions. 31-year-old Rooney is England's all-time top goalscorer netting 53 goals.Rooney has played in three FIFA World Cup tournaments — 2006, 2010 and 2014. At the continent level, Rooney has played in three UEFA Euro tournaments — in 2004, 2012 and 2016. Rooney did not win any trophies with England in the FIFA as well as Euro tournaments. Last year, England lost to Iceland in the Last 16 of the UEFA Euro 2016 in France. Rooney scored the only goal for England. Iceland defeated the English 2–1. Since 2014, Rooney has been the England's captain. His last game for England as a captain  on November 11 ended in a 3–0 over Scotland.England and Australia are set to showdown for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Other interested countries are China, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Qatar and Russia. FIFA President has encourage Spain to bid for the 2018 World Cup. The final decision to decide the host nation(s) will be in 2011.There will be stiff competition from Australia and England. Football Federation Australia Chairman Frank Lowy made it clear how his country definitely intends to make a bid with a strong attempt to win the right to host the event in 2018 while FIFA Vice President Jack Warner has backed England for 2018.Jack Warner has supported the United States for 2022 FIFA World Cup damaging their chances for 2018. Also hindering the American bid is the fact that United States Soccer Federation is still considering their options. CONCACAF President Jack Warner was quoted as saying, "My message to the USA -- and they don't have to listen -- is to try to make a deal for 2022, and I'm quite sure that would have universal support," Warner went on to further say, "The kind of discussion I would have between England and the U.S. is, 'Will you support me in 2022?"There has been no public support for China, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Qatar and Russia.Four games were played in the fifth round of the FA cup on February 16 , 2008. Information on each match can be found below. Bristol Rovers, Chelsea, Barnsley and Manchester United have qualified for the Quarter Finals of the FA Cup.The draw for the third round of the 2007-08 FA Cup was held on December 2 in England. The third round is where teams from the Premier League and Football League Championship join the cup.Aston Villa have been drawn at home to Manchester United. The two teams will meet for the second time in two years. In the 2006-07 encounter Aston Villa were defeated 2-1 at Old Trafford.There are three other fixtures consisting entirely of Premiership sides: Tottenham Hotspur v Reading, Sunderland v Wigan Athletic and West Ham United v Manchester City.FA Cup holders Chelsea have been drawn at home against Championship side Queens Park Rangers.Conference South team Havant & Waterlooville make their first appearance in the third round after surprising League Two side Notts County in the second round. Havant & Waterlooville's potential opponents Horsham will also make their debut at this stage of the FA Cup if they win away to Swansea in their second round replay.The third round will take place on January 5, 2008. 64 teams will take part in 32 matches, with replays if a match ends in a draw.The Football Association of England risked a backlash and possible disciplinary action from football's world governing body FIFA on Tuesday when it rescinded the suspensions due from red cards that had been given during the past weekend's matches to FA Premier League players Andrew Welsh of Sunderland and Paul Konchesky of West Ham United.The FA's decision permitted Welsh to play for the Black Cats in their 2-1 loss at home to Manchester City Tuesday evening.  Konchesky will also be available for the Hammers' next game on Saturday when West Ham host Bolton Wanderers.  However, the FA's actions contravene FIFA regulations, which demand that any player sent off be suspended for his team's next match, with no right of appeal except for mistaken identity.FIFA House had already been in contact with Soho Square over the past week after the FA downgraded a red card that had been given to Newcastle United's Jermaine Jenas to a yellow card on the advice of referee Steve Bennett.  The FA had indicated it would eventually issue a reply to FIFA, but the decision to overturn two more cards less than a week after the FIFA communication is likely to displease FIFA president Sepp Blatter.For the past three years especially, Blatter has been adamant that a red card in a football match must result in the player who was sent off missing his team's next game in the same competition.  Blatter has clashed with the FA on this issue during that time, going so far as to threaten the English association with expulsion from FIFA.  As a result, the FA agreed in 2004 to change their disciplinary process, in particular ensuring the process was expedited so that a player who was sent off did indeed miss his next match.  However, it is now apparent that the FA has chosen to also allow for expedited appeals of red cards on grounds other than mistaken identity, which is not provided for in the FIFA regulations.Although the FA has now permitted Jenas, Welsh and Konchesky to play after being sent off in a previous match, it also extended an automatic three-match ban imposed on Southend United's Freddy Eastwood by one additional match after its disciplinary panel deemed his appeal of a red card received the previous weekend to be "frivolous."  The FA also rejected the appeal of Luton Town's Steve Howard, but did not extend his three-match suspension.Unlike with Jenas, the red cards issued to Welsh and Konchesky will remain on their disciplinary records because the referees involved did not agree that they made mistakes.  This means they will still receive an additional one-match ban should they be sent off again this season.  Following Tuesday's decisions, half of the six red cards shown in the Premiership this season have been overturned.  And in an interesting footnote, it was Jenas who Konchesky was sent off for fouling this past weekend.Steve McClaren and his deputy Terry Venables have both been sacked by the English Football Association after a unanimous decision by board members during an emergency meeting held earlier today. The decision was announced by the FA chief executive Brian Barwick in a press conference held this morning after widespread speculation due to the poor performance of the English national team which last night failed to qualify for the UEFA Euro 2008 competition.  The cost of removing him from his post is thought to cost £2.6 million.According to a study by the Centre for Economic and Business Research, missing out on Euro 2008 could cost the British economy as much as £1 billion. The recruiting process has already started to find the next manager for the team, only 18 months after 46-year-old McClaren was given the role.  During the press conference the FA admitted that not qualifying for the competition was "embarrassing".Emmanuel Adebayor of Arsenal F.C., an English Football Association team, has signed a new "long-term" contract with The Gunners.The striker was one of French football manager Arsène Wenger's most in-demand players last season. He has played in 57 matches, scoring 16 goals in his time with Arsenal. Adebayor, who is also one of the leaders of Togo national football team, with 36 games and 15 goals,  joined the Emirates Stadium's home team in 2006, coming for £3 million from AS Monaco Football Club.The details of the deal are not known yet.Via their official website yesterday, English football club Arsenal FC announced Unai Emery as their new manager. In April, Arsenal announced their long-serving manager, Arsène Wenger, was to depart from Arsenal at the end of the season, after almost 22 seasons as manager of the London-based club.Arsenal's chief executive Ivan Gazidis said, "Unai has an outstanding track record of success throughout his career, has developed some of the best young talent in Europe and plays an exciting, progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly".46-year-old Unai Emery spent the last two seasons managing French club Paris Saint-Germain, winning Coupe de la Ligue, Coupe de France as well as the French league title Ligue 1 during his tenure at the French capital club. Before moving to France, the Spanish manager managed Sevilla FC for three seasons, winning three consecutive UEFA Europa League titles. Emery did not sign a contract-extension with Paris and was succeeded by former Borussia Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel.Arsenal finished sixth in the Premier League, this season; lowest ever since Wenger took on the management role in 1996. They lost to Atlético Madrid in the Europa League semi-finals this season and missed UEFA Champions League qualification for the second consecutive season. The Londoners have not won the league since 2004.After signing the contract extension, Emery said, "I'm very excited to be given the responsibility to start this important new chapter in Arsenal's history." Chief executive Gazidis said the club made a "unanimous" decision to appoint the Spaniard.On Friday, Arsène Wenger, manager of English capital football club Arsenal FC announced he is to leave the club after the season end. "After careful consideration and following discussions with the club, I feel it is the right time for me to step down at the end of the season", the 68-year-old manager said.The Frenchman is the longest currently-serving Premier League manager, having managed Arsenal for 21 and a half years. He succeeded Bruce Rioch as Arsenal's manager on October 1, 1996. During his tenure, Wenger won three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups and seven FA Community Shield titles. In 2002–2003, Arsenal became the only club to win the Premier League undefeated. Under Wenger, The Gunners qualified for the UEFA Champions League for 20 consecutive seasons.Arsenal under Wenger has had over 57% win rate in the English Premier League. Arsenal was sixth in the league table when Wenger announced the decision, fourteen points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, their arch-rivals. Arsenal is to face Atlético Madrid in the UEFA Europa League in the coming week. Arsenal trails current Premier League winners Manchester City by 33 points.Last week, Arsenal lost their eleventh Premier League match of the season, which ended in a 2–1 win for Newcastle United. Under Wenger, Arsenal has never lost more than eleven matches in a single season."This is one of the most difficult days we have ever had in all our years in sport. One of the main reasons we got involved with Arsenal was because of what Arsène has brought to the club on and off the pitch. His longevity and consistency over such a sustained period at the highest level of the game will never be matched", Arsenal majority shareholder Stan Kroenke said."I am grateful for having had the privilege to serve the club for so many memorable years [...] I want to thank the staff, the players, the Directors and the fans who make this club so special", Wenger said.Yesterday, English football club Chelsea FC announced signing Maurizio Sarri as the club's new coach. The Italian coach has signed a three-year contract with the London-based club.59-year-old Sarri has spent thirteen years as a football coach, and most recently he was at Italian club SSC Napoli. Sarri spent three seasons with Napoli, guiding the Naples club to a second-place finish in the Italian Serie A twice, and a third place finish once.On signing the three-year contract with Chelsea, Sarri said, "I am very happy to be coming to Chelsea and the Premier League. It is an exciting new period in my career." The Italian went on to say, "I hope we can provide some entertaining football for our fans, and that we will be competing for trophies at the end of the season, which is what this club deserves."On Friday, Chelsea announced sacking Sarri's predecessor, Antonio Conte, after two year's of service at Stamford Bridge. Conte led Chelsea to Premier League title in his first season  and The FA Cup, last season.In May, Napoli announced Carlo Ancelotti as Sarri's successor at the Naples club. With Sarri's arrival at Chelsea, The Blues announced signing Brazilian midfielder Jorginho from Napoli on a five-year contract.Since the takeover of Chelsea by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich in 2003, Chelsea has now had thirteen permanent managers.Chelsea F.C. fired Manager Avram Grant today. This comes three days after Chelsea lost to Manchester United F.C. in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow. Grant's tenure has been scrutinized ever since he took over for Jose Mourinho last September.Despite the constant questioning of his appointment as Manager of the first team, he was able to guide Chelsea F.C. in taking Manchester United to the final day of the Premier League title race after going level on points and narrowly missing out on European glory on penalties. The club only lost two Premier League matches during his tenure, but he was criticised by fans who claimed that his teams lacked style.A statement on the club read: "'Chelsea Football Club can confirm that Avram Grant has had his contract as manager terminated today. This follows meetings over the last two days," "Everybody at Chelsea FC would like to thank Avram for his contribution since taking over as manager last September," and "We will now be concentrating all our efforts on identifying a new manager for Chelsea and there will be no further comment until that appointment is made."Former Barcelona Head Coach Frank Rijkaard, Inter Milan Head Coach Roberto Mancini and Russia Head Coach Guus Hiddink have all been linked to the position at Chelsea F.C.Manchester United needed just one point to clinch the Premier League title Saturday and a 0–0 draw with Arsenal gave them that point.The title is United's 18th league title and 11th since the Premier League formed in 1992. The title is also United's third consecutive and marked the first time since the 1998–99 Treble winning season United clinched in front of a home crowd.Both sides remained scoreless through 90 minutes, and with the draw, second-place Liverpool's hopes of the title were dashed. As the table currently stands, United have earned 87 points, while Liverpool have earned 80, with six being the maximum they can earn.With two games remaining for both Liverpool and third-place Chelsea, both the second and third places are open, while Arsenal has locked up the fourth place spot.Both sides had great chances, with the last coming to Arsenal captain Cesc Fàbregas, whose shot with three minutes to go banged off the crossbar.United began the game on offense had a solid score chance inside of the first minute, but Darren Fletcher could not connect with Cristiano Ronaldo. Wayne Rooney also had a great chance in the first-half, while United's best chance of the second-half came on free kick from Ronaldo.Arsenal pressed throughout most of the game, but solid defending by John O'Shea, Jonny Evans and Nemanja Vidić stopped several Arsenal chances and United keeper Edwin van der Sar collected the rest.United gave Arsenal keeper Łukasz Fabiański little to do and Ronaldo's second-half free kick had Fabiański beat, but the ball travelled just wide.Arsenal finishes up their season on May 24 with a game home against Stoke City. Manchester United finishes up their season away to Hull City on May 24.English football team Manchester United's star striker, Wayne Rooney, will likely miss the opening match of the English Premier League, England's top-level football league, on August 17, the BBC reported Tuesday.The 22-year-old Rooney, who also plays for English National Team, contracted a mystery illness on United's pre-season tour of Africa."I doubt Wayne will be fit for the start of the season," United boss Sir Alex Ferguson told the BBC. "It's a virus he picked up in Nigeria and it's not a nice one. He's not been back in training yet."The striker position, also known as forward in some countries, is the closest offensive position to the opponent's goal and is more likely score goals than other position. Rooney played in 43 matches last season, scoring 18 goals with seven assists.With absence of Rooney at striker, Argentine Carlos Tévez is the only fit veteran striker available for United. Portuguese striker Nani is suspended, while Anderson is playing for Brazil in the Olympics. Fraizer Campbell and Frenchman Louis Saha, both largely untested in the Premier League, remain two options, as does the signing of an outside player, such as, the BBC reports, Tottenham Hotspur's striker Dimitar Berbatov.Ferguson also said Tuesday that Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo will be staying at Manchester United, and not transferring to Real Madrid, as has been reported, both in the media and on blogs this summer."The matter is closed now," Ferguson said Tuesday. "He is a Manchester United player — it's finished. He'll be playing here next season believe me. It's finished."Whether or not Ronaldo does indeed stay at United, he will have to remain on the sidelines until an ankle injury heals. The BBC reports it will be September or later before Ronaldo is playing fit.The winger position, a type of midfielder, is the middle position in relation to the opponent's goal, behind strikers, but ahead of defenders. Wingers typically play toward the left and right sides of the pitch. Ronaldo score 42 goals in 48 appearances last season, the most of any United player.United has two more friendlies this pre-season, facing Juventus and Portsmouth on August 6 and August 10. Manchester United, 2008 winners of both the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League, starts their season against Newcastle United.Yesterday, English football club Liverpool announced the contract extension of Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah via their official website.

The 26-year-old forward won the Golden Boot award for finishing the season as top scorer as well as the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award. Salah reached to the final of last season's UEFA Champions League but lost to Real Madrid.After signing the contract, Salah said, "I'm very happy to say I have signed a new contract with the club". The Egyptian also said, "My first year at the club was an incredible experience for me and my family. I have to thank everyone at Liverpool and also you, our supporters. I know we can achieve a lot of things together".Liverpool's manager Jürgen Klopp said, "This news can be seen for what it is; rewarding a person who performed and contributed greatly for the team and the club last season [...] When someone like Mo Salah commits and says this place is my home now, it speaks very loudly I think."Scoring five goals in 22:44, Manchester United came back from a 0–2 deficit at the half to run out comfortable 5–2 winners over Tottenham Saturday in English Premier League action. With the victory, United moved three points clear of second-place Liverpool, with United having a game-in-hand.

Cristiano Ronaldo put United on the board after Spurs keeper Heurelho Gomes unfairly challenged Michael Carrick inside the box. Wayne Rooney equalised for United in the 67th minute and added an assist a minute later when Ronaldo hit a diving header past Gomes. Rooney added an assurance goal three minutes later, before Dimitar Berbatov closed the scoring in the 79th minute after Gomes allowed a shot to slip out of his reach.For Liverpool, Dirk Kuyt scored the winning goal in the 63rd minute to give the Reds a much needed three points in their quest for the Premier League title.

The doctors have told me that the decision is down to me. I think I'll start off in Karts."Massa added that his wife, Rafaela, who is six months pregnant with their first child, had never asked him to quit racing, despite being continuously anxious for her husband.The accident has raised concerns throughout the world of motorsport over safety. Other incidents such as the tragic death of Henry Surtees one week earlier, and the rogue wheel of Fernando Alonso the day after Massa's accident have only given these concerns more credibility. However, the nature of Massa's accident, and his ability to be discharged from hospital after only one week makes a case for Formula One that they have high levels of safety.Nevertheless, the other drivers displayed sincere concern for their fellow competitor, none more so than compatriot Rubens Barrichello who was driving the car from which the spring which impacted with Massa's crash helmet came from. Team mate Kimi Räikkönen on the other hand was somewhat less emotional.Massa explains: "Kimi didn't call me, I saw a video on Sky with all the drivers, where he was actually the most calm. He sent me a card in hospital, but it wasn't a problem. Kimi is different, it's what he's like."Despite the visually alarming injuries which Massa displays, his main concern is the fact that Michael Schumacher cannot deputise for him after all: "Now for Ferrari without Schumi it will be more difficult."Ferrari driver Felipe Massa won yesterday's FIA Formula One (F1) 2008 Grande Prêmio Santander Brazilian Grand Prix at Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil.Lewis Hamilton, who drives for McLaren, was able to hold on to take the F1 Driver's Championship.

Borg attended the match and met with Federer afterwards to offer his congratulations.The match was very evenly contested throughout all five sets.

Blake held an early lead 4-1 in the first set, but Federer came back and dominated the last two sets. Federer is the first player to win three Pacific Life Opens in a row since 1976. Federer remained at number 1, while Blake moved up from 14th to 9th in the world rankings.Federer struggled to find his game at first, but he caught on to Blake's playing style during the start of the game. "He played aggressively, took the ball early, put away his forehands when he could, didn't miss on the backhand, made me run around," Federer said. "That's usually what I do. He gave me a little bit of my own medicine." Federer has now won three titles this year, one of them being the Australian Open. He has a 22-1 record, with his only loss going to Rafael Nadal at the Dubai Tennis Championship. His final statement was, "It was a hard-fought battle in the beginning. Really got the better of me in the beginning, so I had to react and not panic. I did a good job there. In the end, I played fantastic tennis with some great shots once again ... the form is excellent right now."Blake took out 2nd seeded Rafael Nadal in the semifinals and nearly cruised through the first set. Unfortunately, he made just enough mistakes in the end of the set for Federer to pull through after a 5-4 lead. Blake is now 19-5 for the year, with wins at the Sydney International and the Tennis Channel Open. After the match, he said, "A couple of shots he was swinging at, you could tell, just he had that confidence where he feels like he's not going to miss. Everything was going in ... here are a lot of guys that can go through little runs like that, three or four games where they feel like they can't miss, you wait it out, wait it out, then you get your chance. I couldn't wait any longer. He's one of the guys that can keep it up. He kept it up for that whole set, probably set and a half really. Actually, from early in the second set, he was playing like that. It's tough to combat that. It's been a great week. This stings right now. I think as long as I'm a competitor, as long as I'm on tour, it's always going to sting after a loss. But I'll just reflect on the fact that it's a good week, I moved up in the rankings played some great tennis, had some fun out here."Ferrari driver Felipe Massa won the second session and the pole position for the Sunday FIA 2008 Formula One SingTel Singapore Grand Prix on the street circuit at Marina Bay, Singapore.This will be the first nightly Formula One event that utilizes artificial lighting and the 800th Formula One World Championship race overall.

Baumgartner broke the sound barrier as his top speed reached 1342 km/h (834 miles per hour), exceeding the speed of sound, and landing in the New Mexico desert, United States.The jump follows several days of waiting for atmospheric winds to decrease to make sure the jump would be safe, and the capsule would not be blown away.A balloon with 850 megalitres (30 million cubic feet) of helium took over two hours to lift the Red Bull Stratos capsule to a 39 km altitude in the stratosphere, 2 km higher than expected, breaking a 1961 manned balloon record of 34.7 km (113,740 feet).While the capsule ascended, a helmet faceplate heater failed.

Two security guards were also injured in the attack.El-Halabi has spoke about the shooting to German media saying "I was with my coach and manager in the changing room when Dad rushed into the room, threatening us with a gun and shouted 'All Out!'. Then he shot me in the hand from three feet away, I cried and cried, begging him to put the gun away. He threatened to shoot himself, but he was too cowardly. He took his time aiming and and shot me in the knee, then in my right foot."Malte Mueller-Michaelis, her promoter, commented on her condition saying "Her operation went smoothly, but the shots were intended to end her career and it seems almost certain that that will happen." It is believed that the shooting was due to El-Halabi's decision to stop working with her stepfather as her manager. The 26 year-old had been due to fight Irma Adler of Bosnia for the WIBF world lightweight title. El-Halabi has an undefeated record with 11 wins and is the former holder of two world titles.Renault driver Fernando Alonso finished third in the Brazilian Grand Prix, held at the Autodromo Carlos Pace near São Paulo. McLaren drivers and championship rivals Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikonnen finished first and second respectively; although Alonso's third place decreased his lead in championship points over Raikonnen, his closest rival, to 23, he nonetheless was able to secure the 2005 Drivers' World Championship. Since the winner of a Formula One Grand Prix earns 10 points and only two races remain, Raikonnen no longer has a mathematical possibility of becoming World Champion.Alonso thus ends the five-year long reign of Michael Schumacher at the top of Formula One.  At 24, he also became the youngest Formula One World Champion, ahead of Brazilian driver Emerson Fittipaldi, who was 25 when he took the crown in 1972.  He is also the first Spaniard to take that title.Even though the Drivers' Championship is over, the Constructors' Championship will most likely go down to the wire during the last two races of the season in Suzuka (Japan) and Shanghai.  Even though Renault has led the Championship for most of the season, Raikonnen's recent victories in the Hungarian, Turkish, Belgian and Brazilian Grand Prix have given McLaren a two-point lead over Renault, ensuring that both teams will fight hard for every point in the final races.        The race commenced with an incident between David Coulthard and Antonio Pizzonio touching wheels, forcing the latter's Williams-BMW into his teammate Mark Webber's car, putting all three of them out of the race (Webber eventually did manage to rejoin after lengthy repairs). The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car until the track was cleared. Following the restart, Giancarlo Fisichella repassed reigning seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher almost immediately, although Schumacher ultimately regained the position during the first pitstop round.Montoya was never challenged for the race lead, and was not required to assist his teammate as Alonso's third place ensured that a win for Raikonnen would have made no difference regarding the outcome of the world championship. McLaren's one-two finish was their first such result since the 2000 Austrian Grand Prix.Despite pre-race concerns about rain, the race remained dry.Renault driver Fernando Alonso takes pole in a qualification session on Saturday for tomorrow's 2009 ING Magyar Nagydij at Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary.Two Red Bull cars also with Renault engines are right on the back of the Spaniard.McLaren-Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen are split by Nico Rosberg's Williams 5th on the starting grid.Kimi Raikkonen qualified 7th for Ferrari.His teammate Felipe Massa was taken out of the track by a medical helicopter after a violent crash straight into the wall of tyres.

It was said Massa was knocked unconscious after debris striked his helmet.On Sunday July 19, Formula Two driver Henry Surtees, 18 year old son of 1964 Formula One champion John Surtees, died in hospital after suffering severe head injuries. During the race at Brands Hatch Jack Clarke crashed his car into the wall and sent one of its wheels across the circuit. The wheel impacted precisely with the head of Surtees.The F1 rookie driver Jaime Alguersuari, who was a team-mate of Surtees at the British F3 season finale at Donington Park last year, and now will drive a Toro Rosso in a race for the first time, wrote the words of tribute to his friend saying "Ciao Henry" on his helmet.Championship leader Jenson Button will start from 8th place for Brawn; his worst qualifying of the 2009 season.For the first time in his career, Fernando Alonso won the FIA Formula-1 Canadian Grand Prix on the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on an island in the St. Lawrence River.Alonso once again had a great race, driving in the lead for the most of the race. Michael Schumacher started fifth, but finished before Kimi Raikkonen, who made a crucial mistake on the last lap. Alonso teammate Giancarlo Fisicella finished on the back of Raikkonen, because of a bad start from the second place and a "drive through pit-lane" penalty imposed by a false start.Canadian fans were absolutely upset when Jacque Villeneuve crashed on the dying laps of the race, causing a safety car to close the gap between Raikkonen and Schumacher.Renault driver Fernando Alonso won the FIA Formula-1 2006 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix on the Suzuka International Racing Course. Though Ferrari drivers Felipe Massa and Michael Schumacher started the race from the first row, Alonso managed to overtake both Toyotas on the first part of the race and Massa after the pit stops. Then Alonso started to push on Michael Schumacher and closed the gap to about 5 seconds. An engine failure forced Schumacher to park his car after the tunnel on lap 36 and the Spaniard rushed to his seventh victory in this season.   Giancarlo Fisichella, Fernando's teammate, had a bad start, but burst through Toyota and finished on the back of the second-placed Filipe Massa. Toyota drivers Jarno Trulli and Ralf Schumacher lost even more positions, when Honda driver Jenson Button and McLaren Mercedes driver Kimi Räikkönen slipped in front of them and finished on 4-th and 5-th place respectively.   The situation in the drivers' championship became almost critical for Schumacher, who lost 10 points this week-end. Only one chance remains for Schumacher to win his eighth champion's title - if he wins the final 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix and Alonso doesn't score any points. "I have to say clearly I don't really believe in the championship anymore," was Schumacher's reaction.   There remains a battle for the third place in drivers' championship, where Massa has a one point lead ahead of Fisichella. In the constructor's championship Renault is 9 points ahead of Ferrari.Fernando Alonso won the FIA Formula-1 Monaco Grand Prix for the first time in his career today. During Saturday's qualifying session, Michael Schumacher made a strange mistake in the La Rascasse corner, when he driver locked his car's wheels, bringing the vehicle to a halt and finished the race causing the drivers behind him to lose time on their fast laps. After a long investigation the FIA's stewards decided to cancel all his fast laps as a penalty for the unsporting behaviour displayed by him. Article 112 of the regulations, applied by FIA, prevents the F1 team Ferrari to appeal this decision. Thus, Schumacher and Felipe Massa, who crashed his car earlier in the qualification, were last on the starting grid. The Ferrari team decided to change the engine in both cars, because there was no more stringent penalty that could have been imposed on them. Michael started the race from the pit-lane.Alonso was in the lead for the most of the race. Kimi Raikkonen and Mark Webber, who were the only serious competitors to Alonso for the first part of the race, lost their cars (due to engine failure) almost simultaneously, one by one. After that Alonso drove to victory with little opposition from the other drivers.With a huge gap from the Spaniard, McLaren driver Juan-Pablo Montoya took second place.The circuit was a great success for Red Bull team as  David Coulthard came in at third place.There was no traditional champaign douse after the race in memory of Édouard Michelin, one of the owner of Michelin company died a couple of days before the race.McLaren-Mercedes driver Fernando Alonso won the FIA Formula-1 2007 European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, Nürburg, Germany.Although light rain began to fall during the formation lap, the start was relatively clean, marred only by a collision between the two BMW Sauber drivers. As the rain began to fall more heavily, the pit lane filled up with crews from every team expecting all the drivers to change to intermediate tyres at the end of the first lap. However Kimi Räikkönen, who had started in pole position and was leading the race, skidded across the pit-lane entrance and back out onto the track, forcing him to drive another lap in increasingly wet conditions. Having opted to start the race from the pits on intermediate tyres Marcus Winkelhock, a rookie Spyker-Ferrari driver on his first ever Formula One race, quickly rose to become race leader despite having started the race in last position. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton, who had suffered a crash in the third qualifying session and started 10th on his repaired car, had a perfect start, gaining six places, but made contact with one of the BMWs on the first lap and punctured his left rear tyre. Within several laps the track quickly became flooded, and on lap three Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton, Adrian Sutil, Nico Rosberg, Scott Speed, Anthony Davidson, and Antonio Liuzzi all aquaplaned off into the gravel trap at the same place - Liuzzi making contact with the tractor attempting to recover the other cars. The safety car was deployed for several laps but the increasingly dangerous conditions forced race officials to red-flag the race, bringing it to a complete stop until the rain cleared up, and drivers once again gathered on the starting grid for a restart. Despite needing to have his car lifted out of the gravel trap by a crane, Hamilton managed to keep his engine running, and in accordance with the rules regarding being moved from a dangerous position, was allowed to rejoin the restarting grid in last place, albeit a lap down on all the other drivers. After about half an hour of stoppage, Winkelhock then led the pack off in a flying start behind the safety car. He was quickly overtaken by almost every car, before retiring due to mechanical problems. For most of the race Felipe Massa led, pursued by world champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton was the fastest driver on the track, but even at three seconds a lap faster than the other back-markers it took him a long time to catch the pack.Rain was predicted to recommence approximately 20 minutes before the end of the race. Renault took a gamble by bringing Heikki Kovalainen in first for a tyre change, but they were too early, and he quickly dropped back from fifth position. Several laps later, there was a rush into the pits, with nobody wanting additional risks on the wet track. The "extreme wet" tyres reduced the pace of Massa's Ferrari and allowed Alonso to come closer and push hard on his rival.After two laps of constant pressure and overtaking attempts, Alonso passed Massa, and held him off until the finish. The aggressive attack style chosen by Spaniard caused a slight contact between their cars.Kimi Raikkonen had been close behind Alonso, but his car suffered a breakdown and he had to park it alongside the track.Mark Webber drove his Red Bull-Renault to the third place. His teammate David Coulthard also made a nice race finishing 5th from his 20th place on the starting grid. This became the most successful result for Red Bull in this season.Still the third place of Webber was under threat from Alexander Wurz from Williams-Toyota who came closer and closer up to the finish line which they crossed with +0,263 sec distance.The two BMW Saubers ended 6th and 7th. And the top eight was closed by Heikki Kovalainen from Renault.For the first time from his debut Lewis Hamilton finished outside the points. His consistently quick pace throughout the race raised him up to tenth place, and in a final gamble he attempted to stay out on dry tyres during the second downpour. This raised him into the points temporarily, but after several slow laps he was forced to pit, and dropped back to tenth. In the dying laps he came within several seconds of Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen, but although he managed to pass Fisichella, Kovalaninen remained out of reach, and Hamilton had to settle for ninth place. He remains leader of the drivers' championship, but now only 2 points ahead of Alonso.This was the first wet race since the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix.Fernando Alonso wins the 2007 FIA Formula-1 Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Monza, Italy, with his teammate, Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton second. The pair won the top two places of the 78th Grand Prix held in Monza, starting from the front line. This win became the first for Fernando Alonso on this track and his another hat-trick.During most of the free practice and the qualification McLaren seem to be clearly ahead of their rivals from Ferrari, resulting in that Alonso easily took the pole position. Since the start the defending World Champion performed extremely well and stayed in full control of the race. Hamilton's position was not as stable, however, when Felipe Massa overtook him on the start, but the Londoner took back his position on the first chicane.After ten laps Massa drove his car to the pits, possibly too soon, then suddenly slowed down on the track. It became clear that the race was spoiled for Ferrari team, with only the red car of Kimi Räikkönen, doing his best not to fall too far behind Hamilton, remaining in the race. His risky single pit-stop strategy allowed him to stay ahead of Hamilton for a couple of laps, but the fresh tyres of McLaren after their second pit-stop left no additional chances to Raikonnen who suffered a crash into the wall of tyres in the Friday practice session.Both BMW Saubers of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica took 4th and 5th places.Top eight closed by Nico Rosberg's Williams-Toyota, Heikki Kovalainen's Renault and Jenson Button's Honda.As a result, McLaren strengthen the lead over Ferrari to 23 points, with 166 points total.

Alonso created a comfortable gap, while Hamilton held off Felipe Massa and Kimi Räikkönen. Massa pushed very hard on the rookie, who was driving in only his second race, trying to overtake him, but made a crucial mistake before the first pit-stop and found himself off the track. Massa finally finished fifth, behind Nick Heidfeld, a BMW Sauber team driver. Räikkönen showed much more careful driving than Massa, finishing third.Giancarlo Fisichella, driving for Renault, came sixth,with his young teammate Heikki Kovalainen eighth. Jarno Trulli, from Toyota, split the two Renaults in seventh.Alexander Wurz, from Williams-Toyota, finished ninth, while his teammate, Nico Rosberg, who had been driving in sixth place, retired following the second round of pit stops due to engine failure.Mark Webber, from Red Bull-Renault, completed the top ten, making his first finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix, following retirements in his 5 previous seasons.McLaren Mercedes drivers Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton win the FIA Formula-1 2007 Monaco Grand Prix at the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo from top two places of the starting grid. As Ferrari driver Felipe Massa said after the race his car was completely "out of pace" and was not able to compete properly. While in the first half of the race he was trying to stay close to Hamilton, in the second part the gap increased to more than 40 seconds. This was due to the traffic, Anthony Davidson from Super Aguri-Honda team even got a drive-through penalty for ignoring the waving blue flags. Massa ended up on the third place.All the other pilots, starting from Giancarlo Fisichella from Renault lose at least one lap to the podium third.Kimi Räikkönen, who started 16th because of his error in the second qualifying session, struggled hard and got up to the 8th place scoring one additional point to his championship standings.

Torres spent six seasons with Atlético, then transferred to Liverpool F.C., then Chelsea FC.After the signing, 32-year old striker said, "I’m delighted to continue at home, the only place where I ever wanted to be, and it has finally come true." ((es))Spanish language: ‍Encantado por seguir en mi casa, el único sitio donde siempre he querido estar y por fin se ha hecho realidad.Last season, Torres scored twelve goals in all competitions and crossed the landmark of 100 goals for the Atleti. Atlético were third in the La Liga table and faced a defeat in the UEFA Champions League against their city rivals Real Madrid. Torres has won 2010 FIFA World Cup and two UEFA European Championships in 2008 and 2012 with Spain. Last month, Frenchman Antoine Griezmann signed a contract extension with Atlético Madrid which runs until the end of June 2021.Australian football's controlling body, Football Federation Australia, will launch an investigation into reported crowd violence at an A-League match between Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC on November 10.The match at Telstra Dome in Melbourne, Australia, which attracted more than 30,000 spectators, ended in a 0-0 draw. According to reports from the Fairfax Media publications, fans threw seats at their rivals at the conclusion of the match.It has also been reported that a number of Melbourne supporters "invaded the pitch and set fire to items on the field", also after the match. Police were reportedly forced to react with capsicum spray to de-esculate the situation. Although Sydney fans had been relocated into an area separate from the home supporters, reports suggest they were provoked and retaliated by using the seating as projectiles.Rob Abernethy, who was appointed head of A-League operations by the FFA, said that the governing body had requested reports from the Telstra Dome, the Melbourne Victory Football Club, as well as the police and security companies employed at the event.Abernethy also condemned the alleged behaviour, questioning whether the people involved should be considered 'supporters'. "It is disappointing that a minority of so-called supporters may have behaved in an inappropriate manner", he said.FIA governing body ruled not to penalize Vodafone McLaren Mercedes because of the lack of evidence that the team used the information possessed by Mike Coughlan, team's ex-Chief designer, improperly to gain an advantage in the championship.World Motor Sport Council agreed that McLaren breached the article 151c of the International Sporting Code by unauthorised possession of 780 pages of Ferrari's technical documentation.Still, if Ferrari could prove the use of those documents by McLaren to commit detriment to the championship the team will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) has revealed the details of the cost-cutting measures for Formula One that were agreed on Wednesday in talks with the teams. The new measures are expected to save the manufacturer teams at least 30 percent of their budgets next season, with the savings increasing as more of the measures are introduced in the future. The raft of agreements has saved the teams from the threat of standardised engines until at least 2013 and savings for independent teams are predicted by the FIA to be even higher.For next season the engines will now have to last 3 races, rather than thee current 2 race requirement, and each driver is allowed up to 8 engines throughout the year and the team is allowed a further 4 for testing. Engines will now be rev limited to 18,000 rpm and Renault managed to obtain agreement from the other teams for modifications of its engine to bring it into line with the other engines in the sport. Testing will be affected, with in season testing banned and wind tunnels not to exceed 6:10 scale or 50 metres per second. Teams will be expected to share fuel and tyre data at grand prix in an effort to save on the manpower requirement at the race weekends. The teams will also have to close their factories for 6 weeks a year. The FIA will also be conducting research into the possibility of using a medal system for F1 next season, an idea championed by Bernie Ecclestone, the boss of Formula One Management.Starting in 2010 more changes will come into force, with the introduction of the cheaper engines being made available to independent teams, costing less than €5 million per season. Any contracts for the cheaper 2010 engines will have to be signed by the 20th of December, 2008. Another engine freeze will occur at the start of the 2010 season, with the engines from 2010 continuing through to the end of 2012. The FIA also intends to try to introduce standardised transmission systems in 2010 and will look at chassis design to determine which aerodynamic parts will be standardised or allowed to be competitive differentiators. Races will see more changes in 2010 with the use of tyre warmers and refuelling banned, and the possibility of shorter race distances has been put forward pending market research. What work the teams can engage in at the factories will also be further limited this season to reduce the manpower and other running costs.The FIA has raised the possibility of a new power train entirely to be developed for the 2013 season, in consultation with the Formula One Teams Association, and will also discuss making Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) compulsory from 2010. KERS, which is being introduced as a voluntary measure in 2009, has divided the teams with some embracing the technology while others, such as Ferrari, have criticised it.FIFA, the world's governing body for football (soccer), and the European Union are set to collide over the controversial 6+5 Rule.The problem is that FIFA wants to limit the number of foreign players in the starting 11 to a maximum 5 players per side while the European Union allows free movement of workers making FIFA's 6+5 Rule illegal within the European Union.Despite the legal issue about the 6+5 Rule within the European Union, FIFA President Sepp Blatter presented the 6+5 Rule to FIFA Congress where the member national associations of FIFA would vote on examining the issue further.The FA in England was quoted on their website saying, "At today's meeting of the FIFA Congress in Sydney, The FA voted in favour of further exploration of the "6+5" rule proposed by FIFA President Sepp Blatter." The FA further said, "The resolution, adopted overwhelmingly by the Congress, requested that the FIFA and UEFA Presidents work with key figures within the world of sport to examine how the proposal might work within the limits of the law."The FA, the national association for England, indicated that having more "high-quality English players" is an "absolute priority."A reservation of the FA is the legality of the 6+5 Rule but they "welcome further exploration of its legality."Spain and Real Madrid Goalkeeper, Iker Casillas, has also indicated to be in favour of FIFA's 6+5 Rule stating, it would be "exceptional" for players developed for "Homegrown player."On May 8, the European Union voted against the 6+5 Rule and have indicated that they will take legal action against any national association within the European Union that introduces FIFA's 6+5 Rule.Depending if and how fast FIFA gets their way, the 6+5 rule can be implemented as soon as 2012 with smaller variations leading the way to 2012.Football's governing body, FIFA, today announced Russia is to host the 2018 World Cup, and Qatar is to host the 2022 World Cup. The decision was made by FIFA's 22 executive members, who conducted a ballot in Zurich today. Russia beat England, Spain-Portugal and Holland-Belgium to host the event in 2018. The Qatar bid was picked ahead of the United States, Australia, Japan, and South Korea to stage the 2022 tournament.Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Igor Shuvalov spoke briefly to react to his country's victory. "You have entrusted us with the FIFA World Cup for 2018 and I can promise, we all can promise, you will never regret it. Let us make history together," he said. Some analysts had suggested that Russia would not win the right to host the tournament, since Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had decided not to travel to Zurich, but remained in Moscow. FIFA President Sepp Blatter said of Russia: "I am sure that to organise the World Cup in that region, or that continent, it will do a lot of good for this part of the world."Russia captain Andrey Arshavin said he was "very, very happy" with the result. "It is going to have a huge impact in sports, in our economy, in the development of the country and even in politics. The influence of football in the world is huge. You can see that even today with the presentations and those who were making them," he said. "It’s going to be the best World Cup in history because Russians are so hospitable. I hope it will change the way that Europe and the world view Russia—and hopefully change the opinion of Russian people too."Yesterday, Argentina and FC Barcelona football star Lionel Messi won the 2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or in the FIFA event, hosted in Zürich, Switzerland.

As part of his visit, Blatter met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, and on Wednesday was due to meet the president of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, and the chairman of the Palestinian Football Association, Jibril Rajoub.After his meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Mr. Blatter held a press conference, in which he said Prime Minister Netanyahu was agreeable to a "peace match", perhaps organized by FIFA, between the Israeli and Palestinian national teams. Blatter also said he hasn't the authority to prevent the Palestinian motion from moving forward and "it is a very unusual and very serious matter". Blatter called his efforts "a mission of peace".Recently, the Palestinian Football Association proposed to suspend Israel from FIFA accusing Israel of severely restricting the importation of sports gear, the travel of players within the territories of the PNA — from Gaza to the West Bank and vice versa — as well as the visits of foreign teams in Palestine thus dealing damages to Palestinian football. The Palestinian motion reads: "Our aim is to stop the suffering of our footballers and ensure that Palestinian football is allowed to benefit from the rights and the obligations enshrined in the FIFA statutes". In response to these claims the CEO of the Israel Footballers Association, Rotem Kemer, said the accusations aren't about football and "we don't have any impact [...] when it comes to security issues around the borders of Israel".Should the motion go through, Israel would be suspended of all FIFA projects and activities, including the Champions League and the European Championship in 2016. For the motion to go through on May 29 it must win the support of 75% of the 209 voters.FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams.

I was there two years ago [Euro 2016 final] and it was so painful that we want to taste the victory now.

Given the potential for confusion about Paralympic classification, commentators and video screens provided repeated explanations of relevant classifications.  In the centre of the field, during the men's 400 metre heats and other finals, javelin competitors' efforts were greeted with "oohs and aahs" from the stadium whilst their throws were in-flight; a remote-controlled car was used to return javelins to the competitors. Great Britain's win in the discus final prompted the crowd to sing along to the national anthem during the medal ceremony. No other country enjoyed quite the same level of flag waving and singing during subsequent medal ceremonies.Women, competing in the two blind classification finals, ran almost-exclusively with male guide runners.  The entrants in the men's F11 discus competition also had guides helping position them on the field, and ensuring they threw onto the field of play.Preceded by heats for the men's 400 metres T12 event, the first final of the night was the women's 200 metres T11, won by Brazilian Terezinha Guilhermina with her guide Guilherme Soares de Santana.In the women's 100 metres T12 final, that Chinese competitor Guohua Zhou and her guide Jie Li finished first was of secondary importance to the home crowd, whose cheers grew louder following the announcement that Great Britain's Libby Clegg, and guide-runner Mikhail Huggins, came in second.  The pair did a celebratory lap around the stadium, briefly stopping as a medal was awarded for one of the earlier events.  At the end of their victory lap, Clegg hugged her coach whilst Huggins knuckle-bumped athletes standing at the edge of the stadium before being joined by Clegg for hugs from team-mates.Whilst Katrina Hart and Jenny McLoughlin of Great Britain received the loudest cheers when announced for the women's 100 metres T37 event, Namibia's Johanna Benson was also vocally encouraged by the crowd; starting without the use of blocks, she earned a silver, finishing behind France's Mandy Francois-Elie by 15 hundredths of a second.  There was a delay in announcing the bronze medallist, ultimately Neda Bahi of Tunisia, because of the closeness of the finish which came down to a hundredth of a second separating her from fourth-placed Maria Seifert of Germany.  Later in the night, immediately following Oscar Pistorius's 200 metres T44 final, Francois-Elie was awarded her gold medal whilst French athletes loudly sang their national anthem.Pistorius's race was near the end of the programme, with the announcer hyping it throughout the evening's competition. When the announcer said Pistorius had entered the field of play, the crowd screamed.  As he finally stepped up to be introduced the volume increased, and cameras flashed around the stadium.  Pistorius ran his race taking the silver, losing to Brazilian Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira by less than a tenth of a second.Australians had a successful night, with Carlee Beattie earning a silver in the women's long jump F46 event, Kurt Fearnley earning a silver in the men's 5,000 metres T54, Angela Ballard earning a bronze in the women's 100 metres T53 event and Simon Patmore earning bronze in the men's 200 metres T46 event.  Ballard, competing in her fourth Games, said following her race: "It's really good especially after how I did at Beijing. So to go home with a medal is great. Hopefully I can do more with that over the rest of the week."Hosts Great Britain had a better night, earning a number of medals including David Weir taking gold in the men's 5,000 metres T54, Graeme Ballard silver in the men's 100 metres T36, Libby Clegg and her guide runner Mikhail Huggins winning silver in the women's 100 metres T12.Current leader in medals China added more to their tally, including gold and silver for Lisha Huang and Honghuan Zhou in the women's 100 metres T53 event, gold in the women's 100 metres T12 for Guohua Zhou and her guide Jie Li, silver for Yang Liu in the men's 100 metres T54, a bronze taken by Juntingxian Jia and guide Donglin Xu in the women's 200 metres T11 and a bronze in the women's long jump T46 for Jingling Ouyang.The United States picked up a few additional medals too, including a gold earned by Raymond Martin, a bronze taken by Paul Nitz in the men's 100 metres T52 event, bronze for April Holmes in the women's 100 metres T53 event and bronze for Blake Leeper in the men's 200 metres T44 event.A total of fifteen players have left Bolton Wanderers F.C. after the club was relegated from England's Premier League at the end of the season.

Coyle said "I was clear with Nigel. I asked him straight away whether he wanted to be a part of what we are going to do next season. He was honest and up front with us, because that is the type of man he is, and said that he wanted to exercise the clause in his contract, and so we wish him well."The other three players to leave Wanderers are Tuncay, Ryo Miyachi, and Dedryck Boyata who all spent time with Bolton under loan agreements. The three players have returned to their parent clubs.However, striker Kevin Davies has a new contract for one year, while defender Sam Ricketts added a two year extension to his contract.

From the producer of Canada: A People's History, H:APH is a ten-hour-long miniseries about the origins of Canada's most beloved past times.The series debut, which aired Sunday on the CBC, centred on games in Nova Scotia and Montréal as being the most importantc dates for the modern game. A group of enthusiasts called the Society for International Hockey Research has long supported the competition on March 3, 1875 in Montréal as the game's birthplace. The game was describe in the news issue of the Montréal Gazette.Handley, however, supports the Northwest Territories town of Deline as the sport's true roots. British explorer John Franklin refers to his expedition team playing "the game of hockey, played on the ice", while at Grey Goose Lake outside what is now Deline. This journal entry, discovered in 2003, was written in October 1825. The Society for International Hockey Research at the time hailed this as an important finding for sport historians.Handley, who saw the episode on tape in his Yellowknife offices, told CanWest News Service that "I was disappointed... [the filmmakers apparently] didn't do their research."The Member of the Legislative Assembly for an area including Deline, Norman Yakeleya, called the documentary "shameful. This is our holy grail. They didn't give any credit to the North."While the producers were aware of the expedition, and other early games, a CBC spokesperson suggests that the choice was made as the Montreal game is "generally considered to have been clearly reflective of the modern game."The Paul Gross-narrated documentary does make acknowledgements to stick and ball sports from Ancient Egypt, as well as golf-on-ice games in 16th-century Europe.Halifax-Dartmouth and Windsor, both of Nova Scotia, and Kingston, Ontario are three other cities who have laid claim to the honour.Real Madrid star Luis Figo has stated that his move to Liverpool F.C. would be highly unlikely this summer.Both Liverpool and Inter Milan have been hard-hitting targets for the Portuguese midfielder this summer but it looks like Liverpool's bid to get the 32-year-old player, with contract and wages talks have been broken down "irrevocably", according to today's The Times.But it does look like Inter Milan do have the upper hand, in this Figo Saga, according to many newspapers.Providing an update regarding his situation, Figo said: "With the English side (Liverpool), everything has ended but I'm happy many other big clubs have put their eyes on me - about Inter I have no news. "My situation is strange. I only want to play football, possibly with Real, but if I have no possibilities here it's better that I leave." This has come to a time where Figo, has flown with Real Madrid to there World Tour, in Japan and America.The International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA) has stripped the rights from Fiji to host the World Netball Championships in 2007 because of the military coup that took place on December 5.The Netball Championships were to take place between 10 July and 21 July, 2007 at Fiji's capital, Suva.IFNA president, Molly Rhone, said: "It is deeply regretted that we have had to take this decision, recognising the hard work that has been done by the Organising Committee in preparing to host their first senior World Championships.""We know that many supporters around the world were looking forward to this great sporting event in Fiji," Ms Rhone said.Alisi Tabete, president of Fijian netball, said that today is a very sad day for sports and that they had wasted many years preparing to host the championships. "We had been working on this event from 1999 and right now I am trying to reason with myself as to why the championships has been lost and just thinking 'what if'.""We have to think positive and am still thankful that we had been given a chance for the champs," Ms Tabete said.The IFNA is yet to announce a replacement venue for the games. Ms Rhone said: "IFNA will now be working assiduously to find a new venue to host the Championships."Italian rider Filippo Pozzato has won stage 5.Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland kept the overall lead, again.The 182.5 km fifth stage from Chablis to Autun featured eight climbs, including one Category 2 climb.

In the first game, New Zealand scored a thrilling victory from behind to win with two balls to spare, while in the second game, Australia knocked New Zealand over with 17 balls to spare after a valiant fightback attempt by Kyle Mills. Australia will next meet New Zealand in international cricket in February of 2006, when the Australian team will tour New Zealand and play three one-day internationals.

"Now we play Portugal and that is 'to be or not to be' match for us."File:4wiki nykaenen matti.JPGPolice in Finland have arrested Matti Nykänen, a four-time Olympic gold medallist ski jumper, on suspicion of attempted murder. He spent the weekend in custody following an incident on Christmas Day in which his wife was injured.Nykänen, 46, is alleged to have left his wife with wounds to her hands and forehead in a knife attack, causing her to flee to a neighbour's house where she called the police. The Agence France-Presse reported that the Helsingin Sanomat expects Nykänen, from Jyväskylä, to be charged tomorrow.Nykänen, who won three of his gold medals at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary and has nineteen medals from various competitions, is best known for sport although recently he has taken up singing, performing in bars and nightclubs, and written an autobiography. A regular sight in the tabloid press, he has sought treatment as an alcoholic and is known to the police, previously serving time in prison for violent offences. His convictions include assaulting his fourth wife in 2006, and he served four months despite requesting community service; a stab attack from behind with a five-inch blade on a friend landed him a two-year suspended sentence and put the man in hospital. He also served thirteen months for stabbing a friend while drinking and has been prosecuted for attacking a man with a knife in a restaurant, a case dropped through lack of evidence.He was regularly drunk in training sessions and in public. A weekly Finnish gossip magazine paid for a series of laughing gas treatments in exchange for story rights in a bid to combat his alcoholism. He has worked as PR representative for Jyväskylä and gave relationship advice answering phones for a sex line. He has also been employed by a club known to hire out prostitutes which asked him to be a stripper; media reported he did private shows, an allegation he denies. Swedish and US porn producers offered him roles in their films.Finnish cross-country skier Mika Myllylä, a six-time Olympic medalist, including one gold, has been found dead. He was 41. Police said he was alone at his apartment in Kokkola and no crime is suspected. His cause of death remains unclear. Born 1969 in Oulu, Myllylä won Olympic silver at the 50km cross-country race in Lillehammer, Norway in 1994, and gold at the 30km cross-country race in Nagano, Japan in 1998. These two Games netted him four bronze medals. The 1999 World Championship in Austria saw him win three gold medals and one silver. This and other World Championships saw him gain a total of nine World Championship medals.It was at the 2001 World Championships in his native Finland that things went wrong for Myllylä. A Finnish Ski Association bag was accidentally left at a petrol station close to Helsinki's International Airport; it was handed in to police, who discovered needles, infusion bags and a prescription for banned drug Hemohes (HES) signed off by a team doctor.HES had been banned the previous year by the International Olympic Committee because it reduced hemoglobin concentration and oxygen-carrying red blood cell counts; this allowed it to mask the presence of banned drug erythropoietin (EPO), which raises red blood cell production. Last year Myllylä provided a court with a sworn statement confirming he had used EPO in the decade preceding the controversy.Myllylä and five other Finnish skiers tested positive for HES in what became a national scandal; the Finnish Ski Association's president, and the team's doctors and coaches left or were sacked. Myllylä was handed a two-year sporting ban, after which he returned to competitive skiing; although he twice won the national championships, he gave up in 2005.These events changed Myllylä, according to longtime friend and national cross-country skiing association chair Reijo Alakoski. "He should be remembered as a great athlete... Mika changed completely as a person on the day his doping was made public. It has been sad to watch his descent and anguish from the sidelines over the last ten years." His passing "is a dark day in the history of Ostrobothnian cross-country skiing," said Alakoski.Since then his personal life has been difficult. Drink-driving convictions came in 2008 and 2010 as Myllylä fought alcoholism, and he was thrice convicted of assault. He and his wife Suvi were divorced in 2007."A champion has passed into eternity," according to ex-Finnish Ski Association CEO Jari Piirainen. "Although Mika will of course be remembered for his sporting achievements, we should of course remember that he was also a father." Piirainen also reflected on media attention towards Myllylä: "Maybe it's just... how much pressure we put on our idols and sportsmen. And how do we deal with them when they are at the top – do we accept that people are people and accept that everyone makes mistakes, and forgive them?"Piirainen himself was caught up in the doping scandal after a news story into Finnish doping led to a libel case. Piirainen's statements in court led to him facing a fraud trial, but he was cleared."My heart is broken," Myllylä said when his doping was exposed "and there is no way to describe the amount of my agony with words. I kneel down, admit my defeat and beg for peace for my soul." The then-culture minister, Suvi Linden, said at the time "Everyone who felt joy at the success of the team now feels betrayed."Myllylä fathered three children, whom he is survived by.A small fire broke out in the iMPACT! Zone during the first PPV professional wrestling match (and third overall, including preshow) of TNA Hard Justice 2006 on August 13, causing the evacuation of Stage 21 (the official name for the "iMPACT! Zone") at Universal Orlando Resort for about 30 minutes.  Although a Universal worker was taken to the hospital for treatment for smoke inhalation, no fans or wrestlers were hurt.The source of the fire was a burlap sandbag in the rafters.  Conflicting reports stated that either pyrotechnics or a stage light caused the fire.  It was put out with fire extinguishers from the rafters, and fans in general did not know what was going on until they saw and heard the fire extinguishers go off above them.  Fans were heard at first chanting "The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire!" like the 1985 song by Rock Master Scott.As the fire occurred, Johnny Devine and Eric Young were wrestling.  The match continued, and Eric Young won the match.  After the match, the iMPACT! Zone was evacuated.  Due to the delay caused by the evacuation, a match to determine the number one contenders to the NWA World Tag Team Championship was cancelled.The Orlando Fire Department was called to the scene, and assessed that the building was safe to re-enter.  As a safety precuation, TNA decided to not use any more pyros for the rest of the show.Jiří Raška, one of former Czechoslovakia's most popular athletes in the 1960s and 1970s, died in Nový Jičín at age 70. He won the 1968 Winter Olympics normal hill ski jumping competition.Raška was a national hero after his win and after he added another, silver medal in the large hill competition in Grenoble. Writer Ota Pavel helped popularizing him with his book The Tale of Raška. Raška also won the Four Hills Tournament and was a bronze medalist in 1972 ski flying world championships."I am very sorry, because Jura was not only a great athlete, but also a good friend, companion and a popular member of the Olympic club" ((cs))Czech language: ‍Je mně to velice líto, protože Jura byl nejen vynikající sportovec, ale i dobrý kamarád, parťák, oblíbený člen olympijského klubu., said fellow Olympic champion Dana Zátopková. Jura is the regional form of Raška's given name Jiří.After ending his career in 1976, Raška worked as a coach. He opposed the communist regime, signing the 2000 Words appeal. In 2011 Czech Republic President Václav Klaus awarded him the Medal of Merit. He was named Czech Skier of the Century in 2003.The Czech Olympic Committee chairman Milan Jirásek named Raška a legend. "He was a devoted athlete and skier for all his life" ((cs))Czech language: ‍celý život byl věrný sportu a lyžování, Jirásek said. "Until the last moment, he was an active member of the Czech club of Olympians" ((cs))Czech language: ‍Do poslední chvíle byl aktivní v Českém klubu olympioniků.Becky Zerlentes, 34, died on Sunday, April 3 in what was to be her last boxing match before retirement. The match, a Colorado State Golden Gloves bout, was held in Denver on April 2. Her opponent for the senior women's title in that match was Heather Schmitz, 32.Zerlentes received a knockout punch in the third round by a straight blow to her left temple.  She received immediate attention from ringside physicians, but never regained consciousness, even after being admitted to Denver General Hospital for emergency surgery on Saturday night.  She expired on Sunday due to blunt-force trauma injuries received to the head, resulting in a blood clot on the brain.Her opponent Heather Schmitz met with reporters and expressed her regret, saying, "I didn't want to hurt her.  I feel very bad about that.""Nobody thought it was a very hard blow," said Jeanne DePriest, manager of Zerlentes' team.  "We've been talking to people all day trying to find out what happened."  Zerlentes was wearing her required protective headgear at the time of the accident.Several commentators have remarked on the coincidental similarities between Zerlentes' death and the events depicted in the recent Oscar-winning film, Million Dollar Baby, in which a character becomes quadriplegic as a result of a spinal cord injury suffered during her last fight.USA Boxing oversees the sport of amateur, Olympic-style boxing in America, as a member organization of the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA).  The non-profit organization has overseen men's amateur boxing since 1888, but has only admitted women to the sport since 1993.  There are currently 2,200 registered women boxers, according to USA Boxing, and interest in the sport is increasing."The USA Boxing family's thoughts and prayers go out to Becky's family and husband. We are deeply saddened by this loss," said Sandy Martinez-Pino, president of USA Boxing.In the aftermath of Zerlentes' tragic death, the USA Boxing authorities have continued to affirm their high level of safety precautions and close oversight of the sport's conditions and equipment.  According to their website, amateur boxing was ranked 23rd in rate of injuries, behind soccer and gymnastics (National Safety Council, 1996) and 8th in rate of sports-related fatalities, behind football and scuba diving (Boxing and Medicine, Human Kinetics Illinois, 1995).Zerlentes had an amateur record of 6-4 (6 wins to 4 losses), and was a former regional boxing champion with several brown belts in martial arts.  She had a PhD in Geography from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and was an Adjunct Instructor in geography at Front Range Community College in Colorado.  She is survived by a husband and family.Moss Burmester won the first gold medal for New Zealand in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, in Melbourne yesterday.

Police and the AA urged motorists to drive with extra care and to the conditions this weekend.In the North Island, State Highway 1 between Waiouru and Rangipo, the Desert Road was closed by deep snow at 3 PM on Friday afternoon. Other roads in the area, including other parts of State Highway 1 between Bulls and Turangi, State Highway 4, via National Park, and 49, via Ohakune, were closed at 8 PM. These road closures stopped all traffic through the centre of the  North Island. About 200 travellers were reported to have spent the night at the Waiouru Army Camp, being accommodated in the Marae and the Barracks. Grit trucks and snow ploughs worked overnight to clear the snow and reopen roads, with the Desert Road finally being reopened about 12:30 PM Saturday.Together with a slip threatening to close State Highway 3 in the Manawatu Gorge and damage to State Highway 2 after floods in the Bay of Plenty a couple of weeks ago, the only reliable alternative route for travellers around the North Island was via Wanganui and Taranaki.In the South Island, Police and the AA advised that chains were essential when travelling over the mountain passes.Yesterday, Mount Hutt skifield announced it would be opening Saturday morning.

He is listed in stable condition.Late in the first period in a game against the Nashville Predators at Joe Louis Arena, Fischer collapsed on the bench.  According to Red Wing coach Mike Babcock, Fischer suffered a seizure, and went into cardiac arrest.  He was revived by team medical staff, who used a defibrillator to restart Fischer's heart.  He was taken by ambulance to Detroit Receiving Hospital.  Fox Sports Detroit reported that he was awake and talking to hospital staff.As of Monday night, Fischer's condition was listed as stable.In September 2002, Fischer had an abnormal electrocardiogram reading, forcing him to miss two days of training camp.

Chicago is located in Cook County.The Gay Games is an Olympics-style multi-day international sports competition targeted to LGBT athletes.Commissioners Gregg Goslin, Liz Gorman, Carl Hansen, Tony Peraica and Peter Silvestri, the only Republicans sitting on the Board of Commissioners withdrew their names from the proclamation. "I'm a pro-family kind of person and conservative on social issues. That's nothing against the gay and lesbian community, but it's nothing I want to advance as a cause celebre," Peraica told the Chicago Sun-Times. In the same report, Gorman said that she doesn't support "special rights for any group."An anti-gay rights lobbying group, the Illinois Family Institute (IFI), says it is trying to get Democrat commissioners to also withdraw their names from the official welcome. "There is a difference between tolerating and celebrating homosexuality," Peter LaBarera, a spokesman for the group said in an Associated Press interview. The IFI also expressed concern about taxpayer money being used to promote the event.Although Gay Games spokeswoman Tracy Baim she said she was not surprised by the reversal of the five commissioners, Mike Quigley, a Democrat Cook County Commissioner said of the retraction of his colleagues, "It's a blinding bias and animosity that is overriding human interest, job creation, economic development and the whole spirit of athletic competition." Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play ice hockey in the games.The 12 other commissioners who voted for the welcome proclamation maintained their support for the event, which is scheduled to run from July 15 to July 22, 2006 and projected to generate between $50 million and $80 million in tourist business to the city and county.Boxing regulators in the state of Florida have started a preliminary investigation into allegations of corruption and fight fixing after mixed martial arts fighter Seth Petruzelli defeated Kevin "Kimbo Slice" Ferguson in the main event of the EliteXC: Heat on Saturday, October 4, 2008. Petruzelli, who was scheduled to fight Aaron Rosa on an untelevised undercard match, was approached by EliteXC officials to take on Ferguson, who fights under the nickname Kimbo Slice. Slice's announced opponent, legendary mixed martial arts and professional wrestling veteran Ken Shamrock, was declared medically ineligible to fight after injuring himself during a Saturday morning workout session, requiring stitches to be applied to a cut over his eye. News of the injury and substitution was not made until after CBS Sports started broadcasting the show. The show had been heavily promoted over the last two months on Shamrock's reputation and the credibility of his name, along with the media buzz around Kimbo Slice. CBS Sports was expecting to cash in with a huge ratings success after securing a record-setting 4.85 million viewers on their inaugural broadcast of EliteXC, the highest ratings ever for a MMA broadcast. Fourteen seconds into the main event, however, Petruzelli scored an upset win over Slice. Petruzelli hit Slice with a right cross to Slice's jaw that sent the phenom staggering backwards. Petruzelli moved in, as Slice was not defending himself, and finished off his opponent with a flurry of punches. The referee stopped the fight a few seconds later. The controversy started the next morning after Petruzelli was interviewed on the "Monster in the Morning" radio show on WTKS-FM 104.1 in Orlando, FL and simulcast on XM Satellite channel 152. In the 18-minute interview, Petruzelli made the statement, "The promoters kind of hinted to me and they gave me the money to stand and trade with him. They didn't want me to take him down, let's just put it that way. It was worth my while to try to stand up and punch with him." It was inferred through this statement that an EliteXC official approached Petruzelli and attempted to influence the outcome of the fight. Slice, whose fight strategy is largely based on punching power, had been training to face Shamrock, another noted strike artist. Petruzelli, on the other hand, has a much stronger ground offensive. Critics during the fight noted that if Petruzelli could force Slice to the mat that it would be a humiliating upset, but if Slice could maintain control through his striking it would be an easy win. With the statement from Petruzelli about being paid to stand up and fight on Slice's skill level, allegations of tampering with the fight began to arise within hours. EliteXC's Jeremy Lappin, Director of Fight Operations, responded to MMA Weekly's inquiries, saying "Press reports that EliteXC suggested or paid money to heavyweight fighter Seth Petruzelli to keep his fight against Kimbo Slice off the ground are false. Let me be perfectly clear with no ambiguity – that did not happen." Lappin stated that they offered him a "Knockout of the Night" bonus if he could score a win by KO. Bonuses such as "Knockout of the Night", "Submission of the Night" and "Match of the Night" are often offered to fighters who can deliver entertaining and crowd-pleasing performances. Lappin also stated, "Elite XC organizes and promotes fights. We have not, do not, and will not suggest or dictate fighters' strategies or tactics. How the fighters perform in the cage is at the sole discretion of the athletes involved."Petruzelli also started making immediate amends the next day, blaming himself for misrepresenting his intentions. In a blitz of media interviews in an effort to retracts his statement, he said, "Honestly, when I woke up in the morning my words were jumbled and obviously my head was in a daze from drinking (laughs) the entire night. Reading the transcript, I actually now feel I worded it perfectly in what I wanted to say. I wanted to keep the fight standing and they offered a knockout bonus and I wanted to get the knockout bonus."Florida officials from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) did not appear to be interested in performing an investigation. In an interview with MMAWeekly.com, DBPR press secretary Alexis Antonacci said, "Our interpretation is that the comments made were in reference to the promoter asking [Petruzelli] to join a fight that he wasn’t originally scheduled for. We don’t believe any wrongdoing occurred." The DBPR regulates all business and professional licenses in the state, including promotion of sports such as boxing, professional wrestling and mixed martial arts.After being hounded by the media and fight critics all week long, the DPBR announced on Thursday that they would start a preliminary investigation. Communications director Jennifer Meale made a statement to the press. "While the Department of Business and Professional Regulation doesn't have any reason to believe there was a problem with the Slice-Petruzelli fight, given the interest in it, the Department has begun a preliminary investigation to thoroughly review the circumstances of the fight."  Pro Elite, Inc, the parent company of EliteXC, has struggled over the last year. The company is over $50 million in debt, with $24.4 million of that debt accrued in the first half of 2008. Trailing behind industry leader Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), EliteXC has rallied behind Kimbo Slice to drive up ratings on their specials with CBS Sports and Showtime Networks, attendance at live events and other merchandise sales. The October 4 broadcast drew in 4.56 million viewers, making it the third most-watched viewed event in MMA history to go along with its record-setting May 31 debut of 4.85 million viewers. Both events featured Kimbo Slice in the main event.The corruption issue could go deeper than just fixing a fight for the company's star fighter. Further fueling the allegations are the actions of EliteXC's president, Jared Shaw. Immediately after the fight was stopped, Shaw rushed to the side of the cage and yelled to the referee that Slice was hit illegally."He spent a lot of money to build up Kimbo," Seth Petruzelli said. "If I saw one of my guys I spent millions on getting his face pounded I’d get upset also." Shaw later apologized for his actions, calling them improper. EliteXC's Lappin told ESPN, "We were not trying to protect Kimbo. He had been training to fight a guy in Shamrock who has a better ground game than Seth. If we were trying to protect Kimbo we would have sent him home. We put him in a dangerous fight." Frank Shamrock, MMA color analyst for CBS Sports, and brother of Ken Shamrock, feels that EliteXC is looking out for Slice's best interests. "As for Pro Elite, are they looking after their baby? I hope so. Are they conspiring to ensure he wins? I don't think so."University of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow became the first underclassman in NCAA history to obtain the coveted Heisman Trophy Saturday night. The award was presented to him at a ceremony in New York City. He received 1,957 points and 462 first-place votes.Second in the voting was University of Arkansas running back Darren McFadden, who was also the runner-up in the Heisman voting last year. He received 1,703 points and 291 first-place votes. University of Hawaii quarterback Colt Brennan and University of Missouri quarterback Chase Daniel came in third and fourth, respectively.Tebow is the third Florida player to win the Heisman. In 2007, he became the first player in Division I-A history to score 20 rushing touchdowns and 20 passing touchdowns in one season. He finished the season with 3,132 passing yards and 29 touchdowns along with 838 rushing yards and 22 touchdowns. Last season, he helped the Florida Gators win the 2007 BCS National Championship Game. The Gators will play against the Michigan Wolverines at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando, Florida on New Year's Day.The Florida Gators defeated the Oklahoma Sooners by a score of 24 to 14 last night's FedEx BCS National Championship Game to win the Division I title of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's American college football league. Florida, ranked Number 1 in the nation, were led by Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Tim Tebow. "I promised the guys that I would go out and play with all my heart. I was so motivated tonight," said Tebow. They were matched up against a Number 2 ranked Oklahoma team with a powerful offense, including this year's Heisman Trophy winner, quarterback Sam Bradford. The game took place at a sold-out Dolphin Stadium in Miami, as a stadium record 78,468 fans attended the match.Both team's defensed dominated each others' offenses in the first half, forcing a 7 to 7 score when halftime came against a Florida offense that averaged 54 points a game and an Oklahoma offense that averaged 40 points. In total, both team's defenses had 4 interceptions, 2 for Florida and 2 for Oklahoma. Florida's defense stopped Oklahoma twice during a goal line stand, stopping them on a fourth-down rush once, and a forced interception out of the hands of Oklahoma wide receiver Juaquin Iglesias by Florida's Ahmad Black.On the offensive side of the ball, Florida was led by Tebow. Although throwing 2 interceptions, Tebow completed 18 put of 30 passes for 2 touchdowns, as well as rushed 22 times for over 100 yards. Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford helped the Sooners offense through the air, completing 26 out of 41 passes for 256 yards and 2 passing touchdowns, but also throwing two interceptions. In the fourth quarter, Tebow completed a key 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver David Nelson, making the score 24 to 14 and putting the game out of reach for Oklahoma.Some college fans believe that Florida did not rightly win the national championship, though. Fans of the Utah Utes believed that their undefeated team should have at least earned a spot in the game against Oklahoma or Florida's one-loss teams. Fans of the USC Trojans and the Texas Longhorns also believed that the teams could have earned a spot in the game, due to their similar records. On the matter, Florida head coach Urban Meyer said "This is one of the best teams in college football history. Let someone else worry about all that. The Gators are No.1."  On the game, Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops commented "In the end, I'll be glad to try again next year. If that's the biggest burden I have to bear in my life, I'm a pretty lucky guy." Tim Tebow, in a post-game interview, said "I was already motivated for a national championship game. But you know, there was some trash talking going on, and it just gets me going during the game." In a losing effort, Sam Bradford commented "In the first half, we had opportunities that we didn't take advantage of. In the second half, when we needed to make the plays, we just couldn't do it."Cyclist Floyd Landis, who finished first in the 2006 Tour de France but is fighting a positive doping test that would strip him of the title, is now pushing his case on the Internet. Facing an appeal before the United States Anti-Doping Agency next year, Landis dubbed this approach "the Wikipedia defense".Landis said on October 12, 2006 that he had published a number of documents in the case "to support his innocence in the alleged positive doping test". These included his attorney's motion for dismissal, a document package containing test information, and a PowerPoint presentation criticizing the test. This action earned considerable but sometimes-skeptical media coverage in the ongoing saga over the disputed race.Landis did not set up an actual wiki, but attempted to draw on the collective resources of cycling fans, using the Internet to allow widely distributed review of evidence in his case. He succeeded in getting the community to establish its own wiki independent of him personally, based largely on the Daily Peloton Forum discussions noted below. The topic had already drawn intense interest in a variety of places, including Landis's Wikipedia entry, which has figured as something of a battleground. The release serves as both a public relations strategy and a way to potentially strengthen his appeal. As Landis put it, "Why turn down free brainpower?"In anticipation of the release of these documents, Landis had been personally posting on the forums at the Daily Peloton cycling website. He is largely out of action while rehabilitating from hip resurfacing surgery performed in September. As the documents were about to be released, Landis said, "I am sure you guys will find every mistake, even things we haven't noticed."In forum discussions, Landis agreed with sympathetic posters who pointed to this as a "wisdom of crowds" approach, while asking others not to judge him based on incomplete information from media reports. He encouraged people to look at all of the evidence, saying, "We'll call it the Wikipedia defense, and I would have given everything to you sooner but had a very hard time selling the idea to the lawyers." At the same time, he said that not all of his arguments against the test had been revealed: "We are not going to compromise our defense by telling all of it."First leg of the second qualifications round of UEFA Champions League is now over. Second leg games will be played on August 2 and August 3.All second qualifying round games of UEFA Champions League were played yesterday and today.

Bernd has consistently performed well for us over the years" ((de))German language: ‍Wir haben Bernd 2011 als ganz jungen Keeper geholt und ihm sofort große Verantwortung übertragen. Dieses Vertrauen hat er uns gleich zurückgezahlt sowohl in der Bundesliga als auch in der Champions League. Bernd hat für unseren Verein über Jahre hinweg konstant gute Leistungen gebracht.Arsenal coach Unai Emery said, "We are very pleased that Bernd Leno will be joining us. Bernd is a goalkeeper of high quality and experience. He has been a top performer and regular number one goalkeeper with Leverkusen in the Bundesliga for the past seven years."Previously, Arsenal signed right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner after his contract expired with Italian side Juventus. Currently, Petr Čech and Colombian David Ospina are the other goalkeepers in the Arsenal squad.On Wednesday, English football club Arsenal FC announced signing Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from German club Borussia Dortmund (BVB) on "a long-term contract" which runs until 2021. The deal is worth about £56 million, making Aubameyang the costliest player in the history of the club.The 28-year-old striker joined Borussia in 2013 from French club Saint-Etienne, and since then, scored 141 goals in 213 matches for BVB. In German Bundesliga, he scored 98 goals, scoring one goal in 116 minutes on average. During his tenure at the Signal Iduna Park, the Gabonese captain won the 2017 DFB-Pokal (German Cup).

He has 56 international caps with Gabon and has netted 23 goals.Via their official website, Arsenal announced Aubameyang is to wear jersey number 14, previously worn by Theo Walcott until last month when he moved to Everton FC. The Gabonese, who has already scored 21 goals in 24 games this season, reunites with Armenian midfielder Henrick Mkhitaryan. They were teammates at Dortmund until 2016, when Mkhitaryan moved to Manchester United. Mkhitaryan's transfer to the London club came in exchange of Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez moving from Arsenal to their rivals Manchester in a swap deal. Dortmund had signed Belgian footballer Michy Batshuayi from Chelsea on loan before Aubameyang's deal was agreed upon. With Aubameyang's arrival, French forward Olivier Giroud moved to Arsenal's cross-town rivals Chelsea. In summer, Arsenal had signed Alexandre Lacazette for a then-club record fee of around £46.5 million.Today, Spanish forward Marco Asensio agreed to sign a contract extension with Spanish capital football club Real Madrid, the club announced via their official website.

Benzema's extension runs until June 2021.On Wednesday, Spanish capital football club Atlético Madrid defeated French team Olympique de Marseille 3–0 to win the UEFA Europa League Final at the Stade de Lyon, in France. French striker Antoine Griezmann scored a brace (two goals in one game), one goal in each half, and Atlético's captain Gabi netted the third goal a few minutes before the final whistle as Atlético won the UEFA Europa League for the third time. This was Marseille's third defeat in three Europa League or UEFA Cup finals, never netting a single goal in the final.Marseille had greater ball possession and better passing accuracy. Marseille were awarded three free-kicks in the first ten minutes of the match. The French side created several chances in the first half but failed to convert any into a goal. Around the 20th minute, Marseille's André Zambo Anguissa lost the ball, as Madrid's captain Gabi assisted Griezmann who opened the scoring with his left foot. A couple of minutes later, a referee made the first booking of the match. Atlético's Šime Vrsaljko received a yellow card for a bad foul. Just after the half-hour mark, Marseille's midfielder Dimitri Payet was injured and replaced by Maxime Lopez. Payet has provided 22 assists in all competitions this season. The first half ended in a 1–0 lead for the Spanish side. Marseille's Jordan Amavi was the second player to receive a yellow card.At the beginning of the second half, Vrsaljko was replaced by Juanfran due to injury. Less than five minutes into the second half, Frenchman Griezman doubled the lead, scoring another left-footed goal, assisted by Koke. Koke also assisted Gabi in the 89th minute, who scored his first goal for Atlético since August 2015. 34-year-old Gabi became the oldest player to score a goal in a Europa final.

Madrid's goalkeeper Jan Oblak acheived his seventh clean sheet in this season's European competitions — UEFA Champions League and Europa League.Griezmann was awarded the Man of the Match award. After winning the match, Griezmann said, "I've been working to experience such a moment for many years". Marseille's defender Adil Rami said, "The final step was too far for us but we fought for everything. We lacked experience. Against a team like this you shouldn't try to play football. You need to knock it long and high and win second balls. When you try to play and lose the ball against them, that's when you're in trouble. The opening goal we conceded was the turning point. Up until then we had troubled their defence."Previously, Atlético won the Europa League in 2010 and 2012. This was the second Europa league victory for the Rojiblancos under Diego Simeone's management. Atlético has also reached two UEFA Champions League finals under Simeone's management — in 2014 and 2016 — losing both to their city rivals Real Madrid.Yesterday, Catalan football club FC Barcelona officially announced the Spanish centre-back Gerard Piqué signed a contract extension which runs through June 2022.

With the 2–1 on the scoreboard, the match seemed to to end with Dortmund as the winner, but in the 88th minute, Dortmund's Łukasz Piszczek scored an own goal, as the final time finished with a 2–2 draw, and the game proceeded to penalty shootouts.Robert Lewandowski took the first kick for Bayern and converted it into goal.

Madrid announced agreement to contract extension with Benzema on Wednesday.They might be occupying first and second place in the Premier League back in England, but Manchester United and Manchester City were defeated following the second legs of their respective UEFA Europa League ties.Manchester United went into their game against Athletic Bilbao seeking to overcome a 3–2 deficit dealt in the first leg; they were soundly defeated.Bilbao began the game strongly, immediately pressing United and looking to attack whenever possible. The English side were the first to strike, with left midfielder Ashley Young's early shot needing a block to stay out. Iker Muniain saw his 14th minute shot strike a post, and Óscar de Marcos miss the rebound, as Bilbao worked to break United's defence down.The opener came on 23 minutes, with young Spaniard Fernando Llorente converting from Fernando Amorebieta's lobbed through ball after completely fooling the United back four. The game ended early for Llorente, as he was forced off the pitch after an injury.The Manchester side picked up their game in the second half; they were continually thwarted by the host's defences. Bilbao remained at their high tempo to prevent any sort of response, and soon full back Andoni Iraola knocked wide after an impressive run.Bilbao's lead was doubled on 65 minutes as de Marcos converted from a floated cross by Iraola from the right, and the club never looked like slipping up throughout the rest of the game. Wayne Rooney, playing as a lone striker for United, finally gave his club's fans their money's worth with ten minutes left to play as he hit home from long range.It was surely a humbling defeat for a team pushing to beat their city rivals to their domestic title, inflicted by seventh-placed Bilbao of La Liga. It means that for only the first time in ten years, Manchester United have failed to reach a cup final.Portugal's Sporting Club had beaten Manchester City 1–0 at home, and only needed to consolidate that result in Manchester. The hosts put up a spirited fightback in the closing minutes; it was not enough to avoid elimination.A slow first half from a full-strength City side meant they were easily contained by the visitors, and indeed Sporting were first to test the goalkeeper. Xandão's header early on was a sign of things to come for City, and they opening the scoring on 33 minutes with a free kick taken directly by Matías Fernández.Just seven minutes later the Manchester team were beaten again, as Marat Izmailov set up a pinpoint cross allowing Dutchman Ricky van Wolfswinkel to tap in a close-range finish and make it 3–0 on aggregate.Despite trailing by three, City looked far more determined in the first half. Their first goal of the two legs came after an hour, as Argentinian international Sergio Agüero finished off Yaya Touré's good pass from just inside the penalty box.Agüero assisted in the second goal, in a way; after falling from a poor tackle by Sporting defender Renato Neto, the hosts were awarded a penalty kick. Mario Balotelli duly took the ball past Rui Patricio to level the scores on the night.Late substitute Edin Džeko nodded a good corner from Aleksandar Kolarov towards Agüero, who was left completely open at the far post, who made no mistake with his finish to put Manchester City ahead with eight minutes left to play.An action-packed eight minutes was topped off by City goalkeeper Joe Hart, who got his head onto a ball drifted from the host's corner but was denied by a good save from Patricio. Sporting struggled to withstand intense pressure, but held out to win the tie on the away goals rule.Yesterday, FIFA announced Canada, Mexico and the United States won their collective bid to host the 2026 men's football World Cup during the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow, Russia. 2002's Korea-Japan World Cup was the only men's World Cup tournament to be held in more than one country.The joint bid, titled "United", received 134 votes from 200 votes (67%), Morocco's bid received 65 votes (32.5%) and Iran's Football Federation voted for "none of the bids" (0.5%).

Instead of the current format involving eight groups consisting of four teams each; the 2026 World Cup is to have sixteen groups of three teams in each, and the top two teams of each group would advance to the knockout phase.The number of affiliated countries of each continental federation participating for the 2026 World Cup has increased. Sixteen countries from the Union of European Football Associations, nine from the African Football Confederation; eight from Asian Football Confederation; six from the South American Football Confederation; six from the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, as well as six for the Central American and Caribbean Association Football are to feature in the 2026 World Cup.The next FIFA Congress is scheduled to be held on June 5, 2019, in Paris; before the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup begins in France.Today, Spanish defender Dani Carvajal signed a contract extension with Spanish capital club Real Madrid, the club announced via their official website. The new contract runs until June 2022.Now-25-year-old Carvajal joined Los Blancos from German club Bayer Leverkusen in summer 2013. Since then the Spanish international has won eleven titles, including three UEFA Champions League titles, three UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and one each of LaLiga trophy, Supercopa de España, and Copa del Rey. Carvajal graduated from Real Madrid's academy, and since joining Real Madrid's first team, the Spanish right-back has played more than 160 official games for Madrid, scoring four, and assisting 24, goals in total.After signing the contract, the Spaniard said, "I'm very grateful to the club. I couldn't be happier, it's another important day to remember in my life after extending my contract with the club that means the world to me, the club that has seen me grow. I've been fortunate to win every title with Real Madrid and I'm looking forward to winning them again" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Estoy muy agradecido al club. No puedo estar más feliz. Es otro gran día para enmarcar por prolongar mi contrato con el club de mi vida, el que me ha visto crecer. He tenido la suerte de ganar todos los títulos con el Real Madrid y estoy deseando volverlos a ganar de nuevo.Per the previous contract, Carvajal was tied to Real Madrid until June 2020. Last week, Real Madrid announced Brazilian full back Marcelo and Spanish midfielder Isco signed contract extensions until June 2022. They join other Real Madrid players including German midfielder Toni Kroos and Welsh midfielder Gareth Bale whose contracts run until June 2022. Kroos and Bale signed contract extensions last year. Madrid announced agreement to contract extension with Carvajal yesterday.Two second half goals by Andrei Shevchenko and Shaun Wright-Phillips were enough to give Chelsea a lift to the FA Cup semifinals earlier today at White Hart Lane.  The first of the matches ended in a 3-3 draw last week at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea had to come from 3-1 down to force the replay.  Dimitar Berbatov, who scored in the last game, was paired up front with Robbie Keane for Tottenham, while Chelsea played Andrei Shevchenko and Didier Drogba up front as strikers.  Martin Atkinson was the match referee for the evening at White Hart Lane in London.Both teams started at a frantic pace, neither wanting to go to extra time in the match.  The first real chance fell to Tottenham's Robbie Keane after he was found by Berbatov's flick, but Ashley Cole's last gasp dive blocked the Irishman's shot.  Chelsea were restricted to long range efforts at the start of the half with two shots by Ballack and one by Wright-Phillips flying wide of the net.  Spurs had two more chances from Dawson and Berbatov, but neither troubled Chelsea keeper Petr Cech.After the restart, Tottenham had several quick chances, but Cech was able to stop both a cross in to Chimbonda and a low drive from Steed Malbranque.  Shevchenko then produced a well taken goal by running down the left, cutting to his left foot, and curling an unstoppable shot past England international keeper Paul Robinson.  Chelsea doubled their lead 7 minutes later through Shaun Wright-Phillips after his first-time shot went across Robinson and into the back of the net.  Martin Jol responded to the Chelsea goals by replacing Malbranque with Jermain Defoe, but the next few attempts on goal from Spurs would be off target shots by Zokora.  Ricardo Carvalho then brought down Berbatov in the penalty area and were awarded a penalty by referee Martin Atkinson.  Robbie Keane scored from the spot putting pressure on Chelsea for the last 10 minutes of the game.  Spurs pushed forward, but were unable to convert any chances, and they were eliminated from the FA Cup.The win gives Chelsea a date in the cup semifinals against Blackburn, while Tottenham's next match is at home to Reading in the Premiership.Chelsea football team today won the English Premier League for the first time since 2006, with an emphatic win over Wigan Athletic. Chelsea, who went into the game top of the table, knew that Manchester United had to beat Stoke City to have any chance of catching them.The first goal came early, with French striker Nicolas Anelka scoring from a Florent Malouda knock on, despite calls for offside, in the sixth minute. Just after the half-hour mark, Frank Lampard was pulled down in the box by Wigan defender Gary Caldwell. This earned the defender a straight red card, and the resulting penalty was scored by Lampard. After half-time, a third goal came from Salomon Kalou, before Alenka converted an Ivanovic cross to extend the lead to four just minutes afterwards.Didier Drogba, Chelsea's top goalscorer this season, finally got onto the scoresheet with Chelsea's hundredth goal of the season, heading in from Lampard's lofted ball. When Ashley Cole was fouled in the area by former Chelsea man Mario Melchiot, Drogba stepped up to take the penalty, scoring Chelsea's sixth. On 80 minutes, Drogba completed his hat-trick with a close-range rebound, as this became the third time Chelsea had scored seven in one game this season. Ashley Cole scored the eighth just before the end of the game with a low shot under the goalkeeper.Chelsea captain John Terry, whose private life had been the subject of intense scrutiny over the course of the season, was exuberant over the title win: "Forget everything else, this is about Chelsea Football Club and our day today. It has been a hard three years not winning the Premiership and today we deserved it. It's been hurting inside of me for three years, seeing Man United lifting it season after season." Carlo Ancelotti, the winning manager, compared the win to that of former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho: "Mourinho did some fantastic work and won two titles consecutively. This is my first and I hope to do the same as Mourinho. Now we have the opportunity to win the double and I hope that my players can, after these celebrations."London-based football club Chelsea defeated Manchester United 1–0 at the Wembley stadium on Monday to win the English FA Cup. Belgian winger Eden Hazard, who was brought down by Manchester's Phil Jones in the penalty area, scored the only goal — a 22nd minute penalty — to win the match for The Blues as they won their eight FA Cup trophy, their first since 2012.United had greater ball possession — 67%, twice Chelsea's. Manchester had eighteen shots, managing five on target; while the Londoners had just six shots, three on target. Early, in the first ten minutes, Hazard attempted to score a left-footed shot in the left corner, assisted by Tiemoué Bakayoko. Soon after 20 minutes on the clock, United defender Jones committed a foul on Hazard in the penalty area and was shown a yellow card. Match official Martin Oliver referred to video assistant referee and awarded Chelsea a penalty kick. Taking a short run, Hazard converted the spot-kick into a goal, sending United's goalkeeper David De Gea in the wrong direction. The first half ended in a 1–0 lead for The Blues, with Phil Jones the only one booked in that half.In the 56th minute, United came close to equalising, but Chelsea's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois denied Marcus Rashford the chance to level up. A couple of minutes later, Manchester United's Antonio Valencia was shown yellow. In the 63rd minute, Alexis Sanchez almost equalised for United, from Jones's assist, but was caught offside. Manchester made a double-substitution in the 73rd minute as Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku came on for Rashford and Anthony Martial replaced injured Jesse Lingard.Spanish midfielder Juan Mata replaced Jones in the 87th minute, and Chelsea made their first substitution in the 89th minute when Álvaro Morata came on for Olivier Giroud. Hazard was replaced by Willian in the injury time, and Chelsea's Belgian goalkeeper Courtois got booked minutes before the final whistle.This was the first domestic cup victory for the Italian manager Antonio Conte, who lost last year's FA Cup against Arsenal FC. Conte's Chelsea won the Premier League last season but finished fifth this time, missing out the UEFA Champions League qualification for next season.After the victory, Conte said, "I'm very satisfied because today was very difficult [...] To win the FA Cup against a really strong team — a really great team like Manchester United — we must be pleased. It wasn't easy, but I'm very happy for our fans, for my players."United's manager and former Chelsea boss José Mourinho said, "I congratulate them but I don't think they deserved to win". The Portuguese added, "Every defeat hurts, but for me personally the ones that hurt less are when you give everything and you go without any regrets. [...] I knew the opponent I was going to play against. I knew they have a compact low block with lots of physicality where they try to close everything." Manchester United finished second in the league this season, nineteen points behind their city rivals Manchester City.FA Cup winners Chelsea earned 1.8 million British pounds prize money.Chelsea, a football club based in London, United Kingdom, have confirmed that Joe Cole and {{w:|Michael Ballack}} will be leaving on free transfers during the summer transfer window.Chelsea, the current Premier League champions, reportedly stated they did not wish to offer Cole, an English international currently with the country's national team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, another contract for next season.  They declined to offer Germany captain 33-year-old Ballack a new deal; the player had been missing out on the World Cup with injury.Cole has been at the club since joining from fellow London side West Ham United in 2003, while Ballack's previous club was Bayern Munich of Germany, arriving under José Mourinho.Ballack was claimed to be "extremely surprised" by the news, having been on holiday in Miami, United States at the time of being informed, according to agent Michael Becker.  Ballack had previously rejected a reduced-wage, one-year contract, and was once the highest-earner at Chelsea, with a weekly wage of £121,000 (US$175,123).Several sources believe that many top finishers in the Premier League, including runners-up Manchester United, are keen to speak to 28-year-old Cole, as he has been free to initiate negotiations since January. However, no deal has yet been confirmed to have started.According to Radio Free Asia, North Korean authorities are retaliating against players in the national football team who played in the 2010 World Cup. The team lost all three matches. It was only the second time that the North Koreans had qualified for the World Cup finals. Members of the squad, excepting Japanese nationals Jong Tae-se and An Yong-Hak who were in their homeland, were publicly shamed in a Stalinist-style event where more than 400 people, including journalists and political leaders, insulted and humiliated the team.Following the event, the team's coach Kim Jung Hun has been sentenced to hard labor following a speedy trial.

The two teams are in a battle for third place in the league at the moment, and both are in need of points to guarantee a Champion's League berth for next season.  Liverpool's win puts them in third for the time being, but Arsenal have a game in hand still to be played out against Manchester City.  Saturday's match acted as a return to the Premiership for Peter Crouch after his broken nose kept him out for several games, and he played as a lone striker with Steven Gerrard acting as close support from midfield.  Arsenal meanwhile played two strikers with Emmanuel Adebayor returning from suspension being paired with Julio Baptista.Liverpool started the game very strongly, with Peter Crouch scoring after only four minutes.  A back heeled one-two between Pennant and Arbeloa release Arbeloa on the right side, and his low cross found Crouch, who slotted the ball past Jens Lehmann.  Arsenal responded positively with a header by Adebayor, but the ball flew just over the crossbar and landed on top of the netting.  Baptista then had a chance on goal for Arsenal after he was found open by Adebayor, but the Brazilian's shot was scuffed well wide of the net and failed to trouble Jose Reina.  Arsenal would be made to pay for their missed chances minutes later as Crouch bagged his second of the afternoon when he headed in a cross from Fabio Aurelio.Jens Lehmann was awarded a yellow card during the halftime break for allegedly spitting water at a Liverpool supporter, but the game continued without further incident.  Steven Gerrard had the first of the chances in the second half, but his shot from just outside the box was directly at Lehmann.  Arsenal then had their best chance through Adebayor, but he was unlucky to see his low drive cannon off the base of the post with Reina well beaten.  Liverpool then increased their lead on sixty minutes when Agger directed Aurelio's curling free kick into the back of the net past a diving Lehmann.  Adebayor continued to threaten Liverpool's goal however, and if not for a fingertip save from Reina, he would have pulled one back for Arsenal off a header.  Arsenal would pull one back minutes later through William Gallas has he tapped home a corner from Cesc Fabregas.  Arsenal put on pressure for a few minutes in an attempt to force a grand-stand finish, but it was to be Liverpool who would score next.  Germain Pennant's cross into the box found Crouch, and after some good control and a flick between his legs, the tall Englishman powered his third into the back of the net, sealing the victory for Liverpool. Liverpool now travel to Holland to take on PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League, the team that dropped Arsenal out of the same competition.  Arsenal meanwhile have no competitions left but the Premiership to take part in, and their next game is at home to strugglers West Ham United.On Monday, London-based football club Crystal Palace sacked Frank de Boer as manager. de Boer was appointed at the English club less than three months ago.Crystal Palace is currently nineteenth in the Premier League table. de Boer had signed a three-year contract with Crystal Palace on June 26, but his team lost all four Premier League matches played so far. Crystal Palace is yet to score a goal in a Premier League match, this season. de Boer's only victory with the London club came against Ipswich Town in the EFL Cup. de Boer succeeded former England's manager Sam Allardyce at Crystal Palace, who helped the club avoid relegation and finish fourteenth. Allardyce joined Crystal Palace after he was sacked from England's manager ten weeks after penning a two-year contract.In the official statement on the club's website, Crystal Palace said, "Crystal Palace Football Club have this morning parted company with Frank de Boer. We would like to thank Frank for his dedication and hard work during his time at the club. A new manager will be appointed in due course and we wish Frank the very best of luck for the future."In November, de Boer was sacked as the head coach of Italian club Internazionale after the club lost seven of fourteen matches.

Everton had a chance to jump into fifth place in the league ahead of Bolton, while Fulham could have jumped from fifteenth all the way to eleventh, boosting their chances of league survival.  England international Andy Johnson was paired with 18 year old James Vaughan up front for Everton, while Chris Coleman's Fulham had a full North American strike force through American Bryan McBride and Canadian Thomasz Radzinski.  The visitors started the game strongly with long range efforts from Rosenior and Smertin, but neither were able to bother Tim Howard in the Everton goal.  Mikel Arteta was able to trouble Antti Niemi, however, in the Fulham goal, but the Finnish keeper did well to keep the ball out of the bottom corner.  Carlos Bocanegra then opened Everton wide open as he stole away from the defenders and headed home Simon Davies' cross, giving Fulham the lead after 22 minutes.  Everton answered back quickly through Lee Carsley after Joleon Lescott's ball found him in the box, and Carsley knocked home the equalizing goal.  Everton put Fulham on the back foot after their goal, and shoul have taken the lead when a nice interchange of play between Vaughan and Johnson left Vaughaun all alone on net, but his shot was hit off the post, and bobbled safely to a Fulham defender.  Everton were then awarded a free kick in the Fulham zone, and Mikel Arteta stepped up to take.  His outswinging ball was glanced off the head of Alan Stubbs, and it somehow eluded Niemi, as the homeside took the lead.  Vaughaun would hit the post again several minutes later, but he finally notched him name on the scoresheet just before the break.  Arteta and Johnson made room on the left side, and Arteta's cross was finished well by the young Vaughan, giving Everton a demanding 3-1 lead.  After the break, Fulham came out strongly, eager to get back into the match.  McBride had two good chances from headers, but he was unable to find the net on either.  Zat Knight then had a chance for Fulham, but the cottagers where again unable to get their attempts on target.  Vuaghan was soon replaced by fellow youngster Victor Anichebe, and he made a nearly instant impact.  Anichebee received a pass within the box, and he cooly side-footed the ball hard and low past Niemi, leaving the keeper no chance, and guaranteeing Everton the win on the afternoon.  Substitute Helguson had two chances in quick succession for Fulham, but it wasn't to be their day, as the cottagers drop dangerously into relegation contention.  Everton's next match in the league is in only 3 days time against Bolton, who are now in sixth place after the Toffee's win.  Fulham on the other hand will be facing off with fellow relegation contenders Manchester City at Craven Cottage, and it is looking up to be a true relegation six-pointer.The Football Association (FA) charged English Premier League side Chelsea on Tuesday for "failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion" in the league game against QPR on Sunday, October 23.The match, which Chelsea lost 1–0, saw both defender José Bosingwa and striker Didier Drogba receive straight red cards for reckless challenges before half-time. Seven other players were cautioned through the course of the game. The charge relates to the players' reaction to the decision to send off Bosingwa.The FA have also requested to approach Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas regarding criticisms made of referee Chris Foy in post-match media interviews; if found guilty he faces a touchline ban or personal fine. Villas-Boas said Foy's decisions were "very poor" and that he felt these influenced the result of the game.Speaking to the BBC, he expressed no remorse for his words: "Of course the FA want to speak to me regarding things I said after the game, but I will reiterate once again that the same criteria was not applied for both teams. [...] If you take one rule you have to stick to it for the rest of the game to show that you have a pattern in what you are doing, and I have full evidence now that wasn't the case. It is a game refereed by humans and human mistakes were present."After the same game, Chelsea captain John Terry was accused of racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand after videos of the two arguing circulated on sharing site YouTube in which Terry appears to use slurs. The incident is being investigated by both QPR themselves and the Metropolitan Police.Falkirk were today relegated from the Scottish Premier League (SPL), after they failed to beat Kilmarnock away from home. It was their final game of the season. The teams fought out a 0–0 draw at Rugby Park,  a game which did not see many shots on goal with only nine in the whole game.  It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005.Kilmarnock had previously been two points clear of twelfth position, occupied instead by Falkirk.  The team in last place would be relegated, and, only needing a draw, Kilmarnock played a slow and defensive game. It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005. With only two shots on target the entire game, much of the credit for the draw went to each team's defensive line, putting in several last-ditch tackles to stifle attacks.While Falkirk had the upper hand in the first half possession-wise, the contest was more even in the second.  On 77 minutes, the Falkirk side had the ball in the net, but the goal was disallowed for a clear foul on the Kilmarnock goalkeeper.  Shortly after, Kilmarnock clipped the crossbar with a Craig Bryson effort.  Falkirk had a glorious opportunity to win the game on 86 minutes, when the ball landed for Ryan Flynn with the goal empty, but the young midfielder put it over from ten yards.Kilmarnock manager Jimmy Calderwood, speaking after the game, spoke of his experiences: "It was a long, long day. I wouldn't advise it for anybody to be honest, you know. It's the first time and hopefully the last time."They didn't really cause us any problems. We had a chance on the counter attack, we didn't take it, and then I think it was the 92nd or 93rd minute young Flynn missed a dottie of a chance. It could have been over and out. All credit to Falkirk."When asked about his future at the club, Calderwood replied: "I'll see what the idea is. I wouldn't want to stay with too many games like this."The manager of Falkirk, Steven Pressley, also told Radio Scotland his views on the game: "It was a very emotional day, you know, we're bitterly disappointed, but once again I couldn't ask any more from this group of players. The things we talk about, the desire, the effort, the application, they were in abundance today. They gave me their absolute lot. It just wasn't to be."This was Pressley's first season as a manager, and he was questioned on his experience in the role: "I love it. It's been an emotional day today, but in terms of my three months in charge, it's been a terrific experience. I very much enjoy it here and hopefully we can certainly build for next season."Falkirk will be replaced in the Scottish Premier League next season by Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who bounced straight back into the top flight after their relegation in 2009.Yesterday, German football club FC Bayern Munich announced reaching an agreement with Jupp Heynckes to be the club's head coach until the season end. The 72-year-old came out of his retirement, and is to take the position on Monday. The contract runs until June 30, 2018.Heynckes has previously managed Bayern in three spells — 1987–1991, 2009 and 2011–2013. In 2013, he led Bayern to treble, winning the German league (Bundesliga), German Cup (DFB-Pokal), and UEFA Champions League. In May 2013, then 68-year-old Heynckes said of retiring, "Clubs want to do a generation change and you can not really do it with a 68-year-old." Pep Guardiola succeeded him as Bayern's head coach in 2013.Upon agreeing to coach Bayern again, yesterday, Heynckes said, "I wouldn't have returned to any other club in the world, but FC Bayern München are very close to my heart." ((de))German language: ‍Ich wäre zu keinem anderen Verein der Welt zurückgekehrt, aber der FC Bayern München ist eine Herzensangelegenheit für mich.Heynckes' predecessor Carlo Ancelotti was sacked on September 28, after a 3–0 loss against French capital club Paris St-Germain (PSG) in the UEFA Champions League group stage match. The Italian manager joined Bayern in 2016 after Guardiola left for English side Manchester City FC. Ancelotti led Bayern to a Bundesliga title, the club's fifth consecutive league title. But in the second season in charge of the German giants, Bayern is currently five points behind league table leaders and arch rivals Borussia Dortmund.After 3–0 defeat at PSG's home, Bayern's CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said, "The performance of our team since the start of the season did not meet the expectations we put to them. The game in Paris clearly showed that we had to draw consequences." ((de))German language: ‍Die Leistungen unserer Mannschaft seit Saisonbeginn entsprachen nicht den Erwartungen, die wir an sie stellen. Das Spiel in Paris hat deutlich gezeigt, dass wir Konsequenzen ziehen mussten.Willy Sagnol, Ancelotti's assistant coach, handled the team last week against Hertha Berlin, which ended in a 2–2 draw.German side 1. FSV Mainz 05, of the Second Bundesliga, have reached the semi-finals of the DFB Pokal, Germany's equivalent of the FA Cup, for the first time in their history. They defeated Bundesliga side FC Schalke 04 by 1 - 0 on a goal from Aristide Bancé in the 88th minute. For Schalke, it was just another disappointment in an already dismal season; being elminiated from the Cup means they must improve their current Bundesliga standing to fifth - it was eighth place at the conclusion of the 22nd Matchday - to have any chance to appear in the UEFA Europa League.Mainz got started just after the first whistle, when Markus Feulner had a shot from the left side blocked by Jefferson Farfán after eight minutes. However, Schalke began to dominate after the half-hour mark. A shot from Heiko Westermann sailed just wide of the goal in the thirty-second, and a corner kick from Mladen Kristaljic richocheted off the crossbar eight minutes later. Schalke manager Andreas Müller was unhappy with his team's effort in the first half, however, saying "We don't have enough power to penetrate towards the front." Striker Kevin Kurányi was replaced by Halil Altintop at the break. An opportunity for Mainz in the sixty-eighth was stopped by keeper Manuel Neuer after an unsuccessful rescue attempt by Ivan Rakitic. Altintop had a shot fly inches wide of the post in the seventy-first. Schalke nearly gave up a penalty in the eighty-second as Rafinha made a hard and controversial tackle on Srđan Baljak, but referee Felix Brych allowed play to continue. Finally, in the eighty-eighth, Aristide Bancé converted off of a long indirect free kick to put Mainz through to the semi-finals.Fulham FC coach Chris Coleman was sacked Tuesday, the day after a disappointing 3-1 loss to Manchester City.  Fulham's form has been poor as of late, with the team not winning in their past seven games.  The Easter weekend was especially harsh for the Cottagers, as they leaked seven goals, only scoring two themselves in games against Everton and Manchester City.  The drop in form has put Fulham dangerously near relegation, and with the bottom teams currently stepping up their form, Fulham management decided it was time for a change.Assistant coach Steve Kean has also been released from the club, and Fulham has made an agreement with the Irish FA for Northern Ireland boss Lawrie Sanchez to take control of the team in a caretaker position for the remainder of the season.Coleman has been with Fulham for ten years, four as the manager.  He coached the team for 176 games, winning 61, drawing 44, and loosing 71.  Sanchez's first match in charge will come against Reading on the 14th of April.  Other games remaining in the season for Fulham include matches against Arsenal and Liverpool.On Tuesday, German football club Bayern Munich announced Manuel Neuer, their goalkeeper and captain, had surgery on his left foot and is expected to miss footballing action for the rest of the year.

The operation went perfectly, whch is the most important thing for now. We and our captain are now looking to the future. Manuel will be back to his previous best and available to us again in January." ((de))German language: ‍Dass Manuel Neuer sich erneut eine Verletzung zugezogen hat, tut uns wahnsinnig leid für ihn. Die Operation ist optimal verlaufen und das ist jetzt das Wichtigste. Wir sehen jetzt gemeinsam mit unserem Kapitän nach vorne. Manuel wird uns im Januar in alter Stärke wieder zur Verfügung stehen.Former Stuttgart goalie Sven Ulreich, who played only twelve games since joining Bayern in 2015 until Monday,  is likely to fill Neuer's place until Neuer returns. Baryern faces Celtic as well as Paris-Saint Germain in the group stage of UEFA Champions League. FC Barcelona's shotstopper Marc-André ter Stegen is expected to guard the German nets for the upcoming FIFA World Cup qualifiers for next year's tournament in Russia. Neuer suffered a toe injury in March, and a fracture after the second leg of UEFA Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid in April. Neuer recovered from the original fracture from April, and joined the team late last month. His club and national teammates including Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Müller,  Franck Ribéry, Jerome Boateng, Mario Götze, and Toni Kroos wished him a speedy recovery via Twitter.On Wednesday, English football club Chelsea FC announced signing French forward Olivier Giroud from cross-town rivals Arsenal FC on a eighteen-month contract.

Giroud's departure from Arsenal was announced shortly after Arsenal announced signing Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Dortmund for about £56 million making him the costliest player in Arsenal's history.A 2-1 victory over Siena and a loss by Roma allowed Internazionale to uncork the champagne as they clinched the Serie A title for the first time since 1988-89.  Inter were awarded the Scudetto last year after Juventus was stripped of the award due to the match fixing scandal, though this year they have won it on the pitch.  Inter could have secured the title last week when they took on Roma at the San Siro, but Roma killed their record dreams with a 3-1 win.Inter scored first against Siena on Sunday through defender Marco Materazzi, but Siena levelled minutes later through Paolo Negro.  A penalty in the 60th minute was then awarded to Inter, and Materazzi dispatched the ball home to earn them the three points.Meanwhile at the Stadio Azzurri D`Italia, Atalanta hosted Roma, as the Nerazzurri attempted to prolong Inter's celebrations.  Atalanta shook Roma with two first half goals by Cristiano Doni and Riccardo Zampagna.  A goal midway through the second half by Simone Perrotta pulled Roma within one, but they could not produce a comeback as frustration boiled over for defender Matteo Ferrari, who was red carded for a cynical challenge.After securing the title, Inter revealed a contract extension for manager Roberto Mancini.  The deal is for four years with an option to extend for another 12 months.  Speculation has arose as of late about a replacement, but Mancini's title wining season earned him the stay.On Friday, Spanish midfielder Isco signed a contract extension with Spanish capital club Real Madrid, the club announced via their official website.

The management and fans knew he was a risky transfer, especially considering he was to fill the void of departed superstar Nicolas Anelka. The management's faith seemed to pull through as Kežman quickly found his PSV-form back again and scored in consecutive matches early into the season. Kežman scored 3 crucial goals in his first 3 matches (2 were Game-winning and 1 was Game-tying). All three were beautiful strikes and won weekly honours.Serbia and Montenegro international, Mateja Kežman, will sign a three year contract with Atlético de Madrid today.

Seventeen points behind league leaders Manchester City, Liverpool is scheduled to play Burnley in an away game on January 1, but would not be able to field van Dijk.On Sunday, defending English Premier League winners Manchester City defeated London-based football club Chelsea FC 2–0 at the Wembley Stadium to win the 2018 Community Shield. Sergio Agüero scored one goal in each half as Manchester City added another trophy to their collection.Manchester City had greater ball possession in the match. In the first ten minutes of the first half, Agüero, Leroy Sané and Riyad Mahrez, who was playing his first match for Manchester City, attempted to open the scoring. In the 11th minute, Chelsea's forward Pedro was caught offside as his Spanish compatriot Cesc Fàbregas attempted a through ball. In the 13th minute, Agüero scored the opener from Phil Foden's assist, giving Manchester City an early lead. It was Agüero's 200th goal for Man City, making him the first player in the club's history to score 200 goals. He tried to double the lead in the 18th minute, but his shot was saved by Chelsea's goalkeeper Willy Caballero. Álvaro Morata missed a chance in the 25th minute to equalise. After the half-hour mark, Callum Hudson-Odoi tried to level up for Chelsea but was saved by Man City's shot-stopper Claudio Bravo. The first half ended with Man City leading 1–0.At the beginning of the second half, Leroy Sané was substituted off and he was replaced by his national teammate Ilkay Gündogan. Agüero, in the 50th minute, dribbled past Caballero but his shot missed the target and hit the side netting. A couple of minutes later, Foden's shot was saved by Caballero. In the 58th minute, Agüero scored the second goal of the match, from Bernardo Silva's assist. Chelsea made a double substitution after the second goal as Willian and Dani Drinkwater came on for Hudson-Odoi and Fàbregas. In the 68th minute, Brazilian forward Gabriel Jesus, who recently added a two-year term to his contract, came on for Mahrez. Agüero was replaced with defender Vincent Kompany in the 80th minute. The task was done, for Chelsea could not get the ball in Man City's net as the Premier League winners won the match 2–0.After the match, Chelsea's manager Maurizio Sarri said, "The performance was not bad in the first half but in the second half there was a big difference from a physical point of view, so we have to work [...] I am worried about the defensive phase — not the defenders. We have to improve, especially on the other half."On Tuesday, via their official website, Manchester City announced signing Algerian footballer Riyad Mahrez from Leicester City FC for a fee of 60 million GBP, making him the most expensive player in Man City's history. Mahrez signed a five-year contract with the English Premier League winners which runs through 2023.27-year-old Mahrez joined Leicester in January 2014 from the then-second tier French club Le Havre. In his debut season for Leicester, they won the second-tier Championship league title, gaining promotion to the Premier League.Mahrez won the Premier League with the club in 2015–16. That season, Mahrez was named Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Player of the Year.After signing the contract, the Algerian forward said, "I am so pleased to have joined City, a side playing great football under Pep Guardiola [...] Watching them from afar has been a pleasure. Pep is committed to playing attacking football, which is perfect for me, and City's performances last season were outstanding. They're redefining the English game and I wanted to be a part of it."Man City's director of football Txiki Begiristain said, "Riyad is a hugely talented player. He beats defenders and creates space [...] Over the past few years, he has established himself as one of the Premier League's most exciting players. We're sure he will bring additional attacking quality to our squad."Mahzer has been allocated jersey number 26, the same number he has worn since moving to England in 2014.On Tuesday, English football club Manchester United announced Spanish midfielder Juan Mata has a one-year contract extension with the club. The club triggered the one-year-contract extension clause in Mata's contract which would keep Mata tied with the club until 2019.Speaking about the Spaniard, Manchester United's manager José Mourinho said Mata is "[a]n important player for me; an important player for the club; an important player for the other players." Juan Mata joined The Red Devils in 2014 on a four-and-half-year contract. Mata made the switch from London club Chelsea FC for then-club record transfer fee £37.1 million under David Moyes' management. Mourinho was Chelsea's manager that time.As of Tuesday, the Spaniard played 172 matches and scored 39 goals for Manchester United, and featured this season in 26 games in all competitions. In his tenure at the Old Trafford, he has won the FA Cup, EFL League Cup as well as the UEFA Europa League trophy.The 29-year-old midfielder's contract was previously set to expire at the end of the season. Manchester's veteran midfielder Michael Carrick is set to retire at the end of the season. Earlier in January, United signed Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez from another London club Arsenal FC, on the expense of Armenian midfielder Henrick Mkhitaryan in the swap deal. Mourinho, who has been in-charge of Manchester United for one and half years, said they "need to get a player to compensate the situation" of Carrick's retirement.Doubles from Park Ji-Sung and Wayne Rooney lifted Manchester United to an easy 4-1 win over Bolton Wanderers earlier today at Old Trafford. Manchester's Christiano Ronaldo was the star of the game, as he set up all three first half goals for United. Bolton had been struggling as of late in the Premiership, loosing two of their last three games, while United were looking for their sixth straight win.Bolton started off the game with the first chance when John O'Shea gave the ball away to Nicolas Anelka, but the Frenchman dragged his shot just wide. United hit their stride soon after, and Park Ji-Sung should have given them the lead after seven minutes. Ryan Giggs flick at the net was miss-handled by keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen, and Park was there to pick up the scraps, but he somehow poked the close range shot over the net. United suffered a blow a few minutes later when skipper Gary Neville twisted his ankle under a challenge from Gary Speed. Neville was replaced by Wes Brown, and the game continued with Ryan Giggs as captain for United. Ronaldo then had a chance after he was found by a searching ball by Brown, but the Portuguese wingers shot was from a bad angle and flew high and wide. Ronaldo would then set up the first goal of the game as he broke for the touch line and at the last minute cut the ball back to Park, who slotted home the ball with a tidy side foot finish. Bolton pushed back to tie the game, but it would be United who would score nect on a storming counterattack. Ronaldo picked up the ball in his own half, did a quick one-two with Rooney, and then delivered the ball back to the young Englishman. Rooney was all alone on the keeper, and chipped the ball over the sprawling Jaaskeleinen to double Uniteds lead. Ronaldo had another chance, but shot wide before Kevin Davies wasted Bolton's best chance by heading over the net. Park then earned himself a brace after some poor goalkeeping by Jaaskeleinen gifted him the ball and the South-Korean slotted home his second, giving Manchester a three-nil lead before halftime.After the break, Christiano Ronaldo had a fantastic chance to score after a cross by Heinze picked him out in the box, but the Portuguese was not able to make contact and the ball flew harmlessly by. Giggs then had a chance for United, but his attempted chip went well wide of the net. Nicolas Anelka then had a chance for Bolton as he lashed a volley from the center of goal, but again was off target. Jaaskeleinen was then forced into a fine save off a blasted shot by Ronaldo, who was soon replace by Alan Smith. Smith was returning to the Premiership after thirteen months out with injury due to a broken leg which he suffered against Liverpool last year. Smith instantly made an impact on the game when his lob-pass to Rooney left the striker open to blast home his second of the game, increasing United lead to four. Bolton were given a consolation penalty as the game neared its end, and Speed's low blast from the spot snuck in past Kuszkzak, ruining his bid for a clean sheet.The win gives United more hope in their goal of the Premiership title, but their next game is a FA Cup replay against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford. Bolton's next match is at home to strugglers Sheffield United.Manchester United clinched the Barclays Premiership title Sunday after second place Chelsea drew at Emirates Stadium with Arsenal. United put the pressure on Chelsea Saturday with a 1-0 win over hometown rivals Manchester City, leaving Chelsea requiring a win to keep the title race going.Saturdays game saw United's top goal scorer, Cristiano Ronaldo, as the only name on the scoresheet when he slotted home the ball from the penalty spot after being dragged down in the area by Michael Ball. Ball had earlier stomped on Ronaldo with his cleat, but the action was missed by the referee, and Ball was allowed to continue with the match. Ball was then involved in the game again as he earned a penalty when he was brought down by Wes Brown. Darius Vassell stepped up to the spot, but his hard drive at the center of the net was saved by the trailing leg of Edwin Van Der Sar.With the pressure now on Chelsea to win at Arsenal, the blues traveled to the Emirates in hopes of keeping their title hopes alive. As the game neared half-time, Khalid Boulahrouz brought down Júlio Baptista in the box, and a penalty was awarded to Arsenal, while Boulahrouz was red-carded. Gilberto Silva converted easily on the spot kick, and Arsenal went into half time with the lead. For much of the second half, Arsenal controlled the game, but on 70 minutes, a flashing header by Michael Essien tied the match for Chelsea. The blues pushed for the second goal, but it never came, and the draw meant Chelsea could no long catch United, who are seven points ahead in the table.The title is United's sixteenth English championship and their ninth Premiership crown in fifteen years, but their first in four years, after league domination by both Arsenal and Chelsea left United adrift in the race.  United travel to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday in what Chelsea were hoping to make a title decider, but with United already in control, the fans at the Bridge will instead clap United onto the field in a Guard of Honor.A stoppage time goal by Wayne Rooney lifted Manchester United to a 3-2 win over AC Milan at Old Trafford in Manchester.  United have never defeated Milan over two legs, having lost twice to them in semi-finals, and once in the round of sixteen previously.  With injuries mounting for United, they were forced to play an extremely altered back line, with John O'Shea and Gabriel Heinze in the centre of defense.  Milan had a boost before the match as keeper Nelson Dida proved fit enough to play.  United opted for only one striker in Wayne Rooney, while Milan did the same fielding Alberto Gilardino.  The game also featured two of the best young midfielders in the world currently, with Cristiano Ronaldo for United and Kaka for AC Milan.Manchester had a dream start to the match when Ronaldo opened the scoring after only five minutes.  Dida was caught out of net as Ronaldo headed towards goal, and after slapping twice at the ball, it eventually found its way into the net.  United, and Ronaldo in particular, continued to threaten the Milan goal, but the next chance fell to Michael Carrick whos stinging shot was saved well by Dida.  Milan then equalized through a high qualty goal from Kaka. Kaka as he received a through ball from Seedorf, and the Brazilian sprinted past the defense and slid the ball past Van Der Sar.  United continued to threaten, but nothing came of chances for both Giggs and Rooney.  A curling shot by Ronaldo almost fooled Dida, but he managed to palm it away.  Kaka then had a solo effort to lift Milan into the lead, as he managed to beat out three defenders, two of which collided with each other, and curl the ball past Van Der Sar.  Milan continued to pressure and Kaka nearly had a hat-trick off a 30-yard drive, but Van Der Sar saved well.  United started brightly in the second half, clearly not wanting a home loss in the Champions League, and Carrick should have done better as he volleyed wide off a corner from Giggs.  Kaka continued to threaten for Milan, but could not get his attempts on target.  Paul Scholes then played a cheeky scooped ball into Rooney within the box, and after controlling it on his chest, the Englishman slid the ball under Dida to tie the match.  United pushed for the winning goal, and they eventually earned it in stoppage time as a through ball by Giggs found Rooney, and his first time strike flew past an out of position Dida to earn Rooney the brace, and give United the advantage for the second leg.Milans next match comes this Saturday against Torino in the Seria A as they try to clinch a Champions League berth for next season, while United take on Everton at Goodison Park, as they are in a tight race with Chelsea for the Premier League title.  The second leg between the two will take place on May 2 at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milan.Manchester United opened a temporary six-point lead over Chelsea on Tuesday with a 2-0 victory over Sheffield United.  The Blades are stuck in the relegation battle in the league, having only jumped out of the bottom three this past weeking after a 3-0 thumping of fellow strugglers West Ham. The Red Devils on the other hand came into the game on a two game winning streak, having scored 11 goals in those two matches. Man United started with the same striking pair used in the last two games in Wayne Rooney and Alan Smith. Sheffield United boss Neil Warnock played Colin Kazim-Richards up front with Luton Shelton, who was earning his first start, on the attack.The first chance of the match fell to the Yorkshire side as a free Kick by Tonge was driven low, but lacked the power to beat Reds keeper, Tomasz Kuszczak. The Premiership leaders quickly made the Blades pay, and on 4 minutes, Michael Carrick received a pass from Cristiano Ronaldo, and chipped the ball over the sprawling Paddy Kenny.  Wayne Rooney then had a chance to double the Red Devils lead, but his shot lacked power and Kenny patted the ball away. Another free kick was taken by Tonge for the Blades, and this one packed more power, but Kuszczak sprawled to make the stop. Patrice Evra then had to be substituted for the Reds when he took a high challenge from Kazim-Richards, and was replaced by Keiron Richardson. Smith was then forced to change his shorts after being caught by Matthew Kilgallon. Luton Shelton continued to make an impact for Sheffield United as he blasted a shot just wide.After the break, Rooney again had a chance to double United's lead, but he was stopped by a well timed tackle from Chris Morgan. Shelton meanwhile caused unrest in the Man United defence with strong runs, but no goals came of them. Rooney finally scored his goal on 5 minutes when his run was met by Ryan Giggs' pass, and the young Englishman blasted the ball far side on Kenny. Shelton again threatened as he turned away from Wes Brown, but he then scooped the ball over the bar. Danny Webber then had a chance for the Blades after beating out Heinze, but he raked his shot wide.  Kenny was then forced into action to make saves off both Ronaldo and Rooney, to keep the game at a respectable scoreline. Shelton then had a legitimate claim for a penalty when he was brought down by Heinze in the area, but referee Rob Styles waved play on.  The decision all but ended the Blades hopes of a comeback, but they still continued to press as Tonge hit the post with a curling shot. Kuszczak kept his clean sheat, however, and the Red Devils earned a valuable three points in the title race.Manchester United's next match will be another Premiership game against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford.  Sheffield United's next, also in the Premiership, will be against main relegation rivals Charlton Athletic, and that match will be very important for both teams.Manchester United advanced to the semi-finals of the Champions League after a thumping of Italian club AS Roma Tuesday night.  Holding a 2-1 advantage after the first leg, Roma travelled to Old Trafford in hopes of knocking Manchester United out of the competition, ruining their hopes of a treble.  The winning goal scorer from the first leg, Marko Vucinic, had to replace the ill Rodrigo Taddei for Roma, and he was paired with Roma's talisman striker Francesco Totti.  Louis Saha was still out through injury for United, so Alan Smith started his fourth match of the season with strike partner Wayne Rooney.  Roma started the match quite strongly with several attempts early.  David Pizarro first blasted a long drive wide before Totti came close with a 25-yard shot.  Michael Carrick then opened the scoring for United as he was supplied the ball by Ronaldo, and the Englishman's shot curled past Doni.  Some quick counterattacking football then earned United their second goal as Brown, Rooney, Carrick, and Heinze all combined to get the ball out to Giggs.  His pass into Smith left Doni exposed, and the striker scored his first goal since returning from injury.  A third goal was scored only minutes later after play from Ronaldo and Smith released Giggs on the right, and his cross was turned in by Rooney off the post.  Roma finally had a chance to respond through De Rossi, but his header from Pizarro's cross was sent over the bar.  Ronaldo was then knocking on the door for Uniteds fourth, as he fizzled a shot just wide, and had a free kick blocked by a stretching Doni.  The Portuguese winger would score just before the break however, as more good work by Giggs gave Ronaldo room to maneuver, and he sprinted in before firing a low shot into the corner.  Van Der Sar was then called into action to bat away a hard free kick by Totti, but the scoreline stayed 4-0 into the break.Totti started off the chances in the second half with a free kick that went just wide, but United would score again only four minutes in.  Giggs was again the supplier as his low cross was knocked in by a lunging Ronaldo, his twentieth goal of the season.  Roma looked for a consolation goal, but it looked as if United would not even conceed that as Darren Fletcher cleared Allesandro Mancini's header off the line.  Carrick then earned himself a brace on the night, as he blasted home a 25 yard drive into the top corner.  Giggs was then replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the Norweigen nearly added another goal as he lofted the ball on to the top of the net.  Roma finally got their goal in the 69th minute through Daniel De Rossi as his fine coushioned volley from Totti's cross was beyond Van Der Sar.  Substitute Patrice Evra then rounded out the scoring in the 81'st minute after a nice interchange of play between himself, Solskjaer, and Rooney, the defender hit in a low shot off the post.  Ronaldo, in search of a hat-trick, pushed forward near the end of the game, but his low drive was saved well by Doni.Manchester United will now move on to face either AC Milan or Bayern Munich in the next round of the Champions League, and their next match is the FA Cup semi-final against Watford. Roma meanwhile take on Sampdoria next in the Serie A, though they no longer have a chance to catch leaders Internazionale.Yesterday, Brazilian footballer Marcelo signed a contract extension with Spanish capital club Real Madrid, the club announced via their official website. The new contract runs until June 2022.29-year-old Marcelo, who currently faces a two-match ban for kicking a Levante UD player Jefferson Lerma, joined Los Blancos from Fluminese in the 2006–07 season. Since then, Marcelo has won four Spanish LaLiga titles and three UEFA Champions League titles.Since joining the club at age eighteen, Marcelo has won a total of seventeen titles with Real Madrid including three UEFA Super Cups, three Spanish Super Cups — Supercopa de España — and two each of Copa del Rey and FIFA Club World Cup. During his tenure at the Santiago Bernabéu, Marcelo has featured in 415 matches for the club, and also serves as the vice-captain of the team. Only his compatriot Roberto Carlos has more appearances as a foreign player for Real Madrid with 527 matches. Due to the suspension in the previous league game, Marcelo is to miss upcoming matches against Real Sociedad and Real Betis.Per the previous contract, Marcelo was tied with the club until June 2020. Last, year, German midfielder Toni Kroos and Welsh midfielder Gareth Bale signed contract extensions with Madrid which also run until June 2022.England boss Steve McClaren has announced his 23-man squad for the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel and Andorra.The biggest surprise pick for the squad was Newcastle United's Scott Parker.  Bayern Munich midfielder Owen Hargreaves will make his England return after a broken leg kept him out of competition.  Other central midfielders in the squad will include Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Michael Carrick. On the wings, Aaron Lennon may start down the right, while Kieron Dyer or Stewart Downing may play on the left.Likely strikers for the club are Manchester United's Wayne Rooney and Andy Johnson of Everton.Manchester United's on-loan keeper Ben Foster started the game against Spain last time out for England, but he is sure to be backup to Paul Robinson in the qualifiers.John Terry and Rio Ferdinand may well make up the center of the defense with Gary Neville and Ashley Cole possibly supporting from the defensive wings.  Notable exceptions from the squad include Manchester City's Joey Barton and Gareth Barrey of Aston Villa.Australian football (soccer) club Melbourne Victory FC have defeated New Zealand's Wellington Phoenix FC 8-7 in a penalty shootout to win the fourth annual A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup. The match, played at Westpac Stadium in Wellington, New Zealand in front of 9,208 spectators, finished at 0-0 after the regulation 90 minutes.The match saw relatively few chances, the best of which fell to the Phoenix. Melbourne goalkeeper Michael Theoklitos made two stunning saves in the second half which were the obvious highlights of the regulation playing time. On 68 minutes, the Victory failed to sufficiently clear a corner kick by the Phoenix, and midfielder Richard Johnson sent a volley shot heading towards the right hand side of the net from 20 metres out until Theoklitos' intervention prevented it from breaking the deadlock.The other major chance of the match came 12 minutes later, when the home side's striker Shane Smeltz headed the ball towards the bottom left hand corner of the Melbourne goal. Once again, Theoklitos managed to readjust his balance and made the save down low to his right, parrying the ball away from the danger area.With the 2008-09 A-League — Australia's top-tier football completion — season proper starting in only nine days, competition rules provide that if the scores finish level after 90 minutes, the match goes directly to a penalty shootout. In nearly all other competitions around the world, including the season proper's final series, 30 minutes of extra time would be played before a penalty shootout is used.Melbourne captain Rodrigo Vargas won the coin-toss prior to the shootout and elected that his side would go first. During the opening five penalties, both Smeltz for Wellington and Nick Ward for Melbourne missed the goals completely — both shooting high and to the left of the goals in very similar style to each other — resulting in the scoreline being 4-4 after the five mandatory penalties. At this point the shootout became a "sudden death" situation.Three more pairs of penalties passed with success by both sides, before the shootout was decided on the ninth round of the shootout. Melbourne scored, before Wellington's Karl Dodd's penalty driven low to the right hand side of Theoklitos was stopped by the Victory 'keeper to win the Cup for Melbourne after 18 penalty kicks.The trophy was the Victory's third piece of silverware since their establishment for the start of the A-League competition in 2005; they we the premiers and champions of the 2006-07 A-League season. For Wellington, this was their first ever final in any competition, as well as the first time a New Zealand side has been in an Australian domestic club competition final in the history of professional football (soccer) in the country, which dates back to the Football Kingz FC in 1999.On Saturday, Argentine forward Lionel Messi signed a contract extension with Spanish football club FC Barcelona, the club announced via their official website. The new contract runs until 2021.30-year-old Messi joined Blaugrana from Argentine club Newell's Old Boys in 2000 at the age of thirteen and made his professional debut at the age of seventeen. In his tenure at Camp Nou, the Argentine international has won four UEFA Champions League titles, eight Spanish LaLiga titles, five Copa del Rey trophies, seven Supercopa de España (Spanish Super Cups), three European Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. Along with Barcelona's midfielder Andrés Iniesta, Messi has won 30 trophies with the Catalans, the most in the club's history. Messi has played 603 games in the Catalan jersey, scoring 523 goals in all competitions including 361 goals in LaLiga. All time top-scorer in LaLiga and FC Barcelona's history, Messi won his fourth European Golden Shoe on Friday for finishing as the top-scorer in all European leagues, scoring 37 goals in LaLiga last season. Per the previous contract, Messi was tied to FC Barcelona until June 2018. Per the new contract, the Argentinian's buy-out clause is set to €700 million which was previously set to €300 million. After penning the three-year extension, Messi said, "I'm happy to continue with the club, which is my home. My dream was to finish my career at Barca and we are moving down that path."Yesterday, French capital football club Paris Saint-Germain triggered a €222 million (about US$263m, £198m) buyout clause of Brazilian winger Neymar to sign him from FC Barcelona, making him the most expensive footballer of all time by breaking the previous fee record of Paul Pogba's transfer from Juventus FC to Manchester United. Neymar signed a five year contract with Paris SG which runs until June 2022. 25-year-old Neymar made his professional debut for Santos FC in January 2009, netting 138 goals in 229 matches. He was signed by FC Barcelona in 2013. Since then, Neymar has scored 105 goals and provided 80 assists in 186 games for Barça. In four seasons at Camp Nou, Neymar won two LaLiga titles, three Copa del Rey trophies, and one each of Champions League trophy Supercopa de España. Neymar was part of Barcelona's treble winning squad in 2014–15, and finished third in 2015's FIFA Ballon d'Or. Neymar made an international debut at the age of eighteen. He has scored 52 goals in 77 games for Brazil.Paris SG's Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said, "Today, with the arrival of Neymar Jr, I am convinced that we will come even closer, with the support of our faithful fans, to realizing our greatest dreams". After penning a five-year contract, Neymar said, "I am extremely happy to join Paris Saint-Germain. Since I arrived in Europe, the club has always been one of the most competitive and most ambitious. And the biggest challenge, what most motivated me to join my new teammates, is to help the club to conquer the titles that their fans want." Neymar's lawyer submitted a check of €222m to deposit Neymar's buy-out clause at LaLiga's headquarters, but it was rejected. LaLiga officials issued an official statement, which read, "We can confirm that the player's lawyers came to the La Liga offices this morning to deposit the clause and that it has been rejected.[...] That's all the information we are giving out at this moment."Later, Neymar's legal representative delivered the check to FC Barcelona. A statement from Barcelona confirmed they received the payment and Neymar was no longer contracted to the club. The statement read, "On Thursday afternoon Neymar Jr's legal representatives visited in person the Club's offices and made the payment of 222 million euros in the player's name with regards to the unilateral termination of the contract that united both parties." ((es))Spanish language: ‍Esta tarde, representantes legales de Neymar Jr. se han personado en las oficinas del Club y han hecho efectivo, en nombre del jugador, el pago de 222 millones de euros, en concepto de indemnización por la rescisión unilateral y sin causa del contrato que unía a ambas partes. It also said, "the Club will pass on to UEFA the details of the above operation so that they can determine the disciplinary responsibilities that may arise from this case." ((es))Spanish language: ‍el Club trasladará a la UEFA los detalles de esta operación para que depuren las responsabilidades disciplinarias que puedan derivarse de este caso. Financial fair play rules prevents European clubs from spending more than €30 million from their earnings. Paris SG was fined by UEFA in 2014 for violating financial fair play rules.Manchester United's manager José Mourinho, who spent about €105 million last season to sign Paul Pogba, and a reported fee of €75 million to sign Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku from Everton FC this season,  said, "Expensive are the ones who get into a certain level without a certain quality. For £200m, I don't think [Neymar] is expensive. [...] I think he's expensive in the fact that now you are going to have more players at £100m, you are going have more players at £80m and more players at £60m. And I think that's the problem. [...] So I think the problem is not Neymar, I think the problem is the consequences of Neymar."  Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp said, "I thought Fair Play was made so that situations like that can't happen. That's more of a suggestion than a real rule."  French club Lille director general Marc Ingla, who had once served as Barça's vice-president said, "It's a blow for Barcelona. Neymar is an accelerator to this bright future of Ligue 1. The young talent pool we have here is the best in Europe. For sure we can still compete with PSG. Once you get on the pitch it's 11 v 11 and all the transfer fees and salaries narrow a bit."  Before the official announcement of the agreement, yesterday, Arsenal's manager Arsène Wenger also remarked about the financial fair play and said, "Once a country owns a club, everything is possible. It becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent [that] country. It can't justify the investments and looks unusual for the game. That's why I always [support] football living with its own resources. You don't look at the numbers in their absolute value anymore. Football has been for a long time out of normal society and the numbers are like the NBA in basketball, so it's not comparable to normal life anymore. Those are the numbers. It was already out of context of society, so after it just becomes a bit extra. You cannot calculate what it brings in anymore, it's just a number."On Wednesday, Neymar's Lionel Messi posted on Instagram: "It was a great pleasure to have shared all these years with you, friend @neymarjr [Neymar]. I wish you good luck in this new stage of your life. See you tomorrow" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Fue un placer enorme haber compartido todos estos años con vos, amigo @neymarjr [Neymar]. Te deseo mucha suerte en esta nueva etapa de tu vida. Nos vemos Tkm. Barcelona's striker Luis Suárez dedicated an Instagram post for Neymar after Lionel Messi, and said, " My friend i wish you the best in everything that comes!!! Also thank you for your support, for everything that i learned with you and for the unique moments that we spent together!!!! Keep like this and never change love you little bro" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Amigo desearte todo lo mejor en lo que viene!!! También agradecerte todo el cariño que me diste, por lo que aprendí contigo y por los momentos únicos que pasamos!!!! Seguí así y no cambies nunca te quiero hermanito. Neymar has been assigned number 10 jersey.Yesterday, German football club Borussia Dortmund (BVB) sacked manager Peter Bosz. They named Peter Stöger, former manager of FC Köln, Bosz's successor.After BVB parted ways with Thomas Tuchel at the end of May, Bosz joined signed a two-year deal with BVB. In the 2016–17 season, 53-year-old Bosz led the Dutch capital club AFC Ajax to a second-place finish in the Dutch league Eredivisie, finishing just one point below Feyenoord Rotterdam, and won a silver medal in the UEFA Europa League, losing 2–0 against Manchester United.Dortmund were Bundesliga table toppers in the beginning of the season, winning nineteen points in their first seven league games. However, after September 30, BVB registered only one win in thirteen games, which was against third division club FC Magdeburg. Dortmund is currently seventh in the league table.Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc said, "Peter Stöger developed the club at Köln for over four years. He has shown he can bring stability to a team, and we need stability, especially at the back." Stöger was sacked as Köln's manager last week. Köln finished fifth last season under Stöger, but did not win a single Bundesliga game this season. BVB's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said, "We are not used to changing coaches during a season. We are thankful that Stoger accepted it. He has not yet signed a contract, but will sign a contract until June 30, 2018."BVB did not win a single match in the UEFA Champions League group stage knockout phase. They finished third and are to play in the UEFA Europa League. Bosz's last match for Borussia Dortmund was at BVB's home stadium Signal Iduna Park on Saturday against Werder Bremen in Bundesliga which ended in a 2–1 defeat. Dortmund did not win a single game in the last eight league games. The Dutchman managed Dortmund for 167 days.The Professional Footballers' Association announced nominees for the Players' Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year on Friday.

Oranje defeated Sweden 2–1 at home, but failed to qualify for a second consecutive major tournament, after last year's UEFA Euro tournament.Robben, playing his 96th international match on Tuesday, made his international debut in April 2003. Netherlands played Sweden at the Amsterdam ArenA in the Dutch capital, and were awarded a penalty kick in the sixteenth minute after a handball from Swedish defender Victor Lindelöf in the penalty area. Robben scored from the spot, netting his 36th international goal from a Panenka kick. In the 40th minute, Robben scored his second of the night, from outside the box. The scoreline remained 2–0 at the end of full time. Netherlands dominated in ball possession having 69%. The win gave the Oranjes three points, tying with Sweden with nineteen points from all the group stage matches.

Robben has featured in the FIFA World Cup tournaments of 2006, 2010 and 2014. He has won a silver medal at the 2010 World Cup, losing to Spain in extra time, and a bronze medal finishing third in 2014's World Cup in Brazil.After the match, Robben said, "I've been thinking about this for a long time. I've thought about stopping, but I've continued. I'm 33 years old, I'm playing in a top club in Europe, so you have to make choices. I'm going to concentrate completely on my club now. This is a good time to leave it to someone else." ((nl))Dutch language: ‍Ik heb hier lang over nagedacht. Een hele tijd terug heb ik al overwogen te stoppen, maar toen ben ik toch doorgegaan. Ik ben nu 33 jaar, ik speel bij een topclub in Europa, dan moet je keuzes maken. Ik ga me nu vol concentreren op mijn club.

The loss is the first Inter have suffered this season, and it came at a very unfortunate time.  With a win, Inter could have sealed the league title for themselves, breaking the record for clinched title with most games remaining.

Inter equalized in the 52th minute when Adriano earned a soft penalty, and Marco Materazzi scored from the spot. In the 88th minute, Roma captain Francesco Totti scored a freekick goal after a deflection off Luis Figo in the wall. Roma sealed the win only a minute later through Marco Cassetti.Though mathematically Roma could still win the league, the reality of the situation is that Inter will seal the league title easily within the five remaining games.

Roma's next match is also on Sunday, as they take on tenth place Atalanta.A Brazilian international footballer, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, also known as Little Ronaldo (Ronaldinho), signed a contract with FC Barcelona until 2010, today, prolonging it for two years. It is fairly certain that he will stay in the club for the length of the contract. "Now I'll just carry on doing the same as I have been doing until now, only that now I have a longer term contract, I'll be even more motivated," an official Barcelona website quoted Ronaldinho. According to a new clause in his contract, any club who wants to buy him will have to part with 85 million pounds. One of the most interested teams was Chelsea FC, who were looking to fill their striker position. Ronaldinho is happy to stay in Barcelona: "You cannot put a price on the happiness and joy I am feeling right now." He transferred from Paris Saint-Germain in 2003 for 17 million pounds becoming one of the biggest football starts in Spain. FIFA awarded him the prestigous title of "best football player in the world" in 2005.A penalty by Cristiano Ronaldo in the 76th minute was all that separated Manchester United and Middlesbrough earlier today at Old Trafford.  The FA Cup 6th round replay was forced after a Ronaldo penalty a week ago which tied the last match at 2-2, sending the second game to Old Trafford.  Middlesbrough started with the deadly strike pair of Mark Viduka and Yakubu up front, while Manchester had Alan Smith and Wayne Rooney as paired strikers.United came out with the first good chances of the game as Wayne Rooney had an attempt on net, but saw his shot blocked by defender Jonathan Woodgate.  Nemanja Vidic then had a chance for United off a Giggs corner, but his powerful header was held by keeper Mark Schwarzer.  Ronaldo then had a shot on net after the ball fortuitously fell to his feet, but the Portuguese midfielders strike flew just wide.  Middlesbrough survived through the first onslaught and had their first real chance on 16 minutes when a deflected pass by Xavier found its way to Mark Viduka, but his shot flew wide of Tomasz Kuszczak's goal.  Woodgate soon saved Middlesbrough again as he blocked a cross net pass from Ronaldo which was aimed for a wide open Alan Smith.  Wayne Rooney was then given a clear run in on goal after he was found by a well time through ball from Giggs, but Mark Schwarzer spread wide to snatch the ball from Rooney's feet.  Mark Viduka then made space in the United penalty box and dropped off a pass for Stuart Downing, but his right footed shot flew wide yet again.  Ronaldo again threatened 'Boro, but he saw his wide angled shot bang off the post after rounding Schwarzer.  Rooney again was given a break away on net, but he was again stopped by the Australian Schwarzer.  Soon after, Jonathan Woodgate brought Ronaldo down in the box, and United were awarded a penalty.  Ronaldo sent the ball high and to the left of Schwarzer as the keeper went the wrong way, and United took the lead.  Middlesbrough had little more in the way of attacking threat, with a wide shot by Morrison being all they could muster.  The game did end on a sour note, however, after a few scuffles and a cynical challenge on Ronaldo by James Morrison saw several yellow cards handed out and Morrison was shown red.  United will take on Watford in the semifinals of the cup while Middlesbrough have only the Premier League to focus on now, with their next match being played at West Ham.Three-time soccer world player of the year Ronaldo has agreed to return home to Brazil and join Corinthians in São Paulo.Ronaldo (born Ronaldo Luis Nazário de Lima), 32, is coming back from a major knee injury after rupturing a tendon in his left knee nine months ago - the third such injury in his career. In June, Italian powerhouse A.C. Milan let Ronaldo go instead of resigning him as he had reached the end of his contract. Many people thought this injury could be the end of Ronaldo's career - including Ronaldo himself."I don't know if I will continue to play or if I will retire," Ronaldo told Gazzetta dello Sport in November.  "I have not taken a decision yet. I am in no hurry to make a decision. I want to complete my recovery."Apparently, that decision has been made. Ronaldo's agent, Fabiano Farah stated today, "We've reached a verbal agreement for Ronaldo to play there [São Paulo])."It is unofficially believed that Ronaldo will receive a one year contract, and the Corinthians posted a statement to their website, writing: "In the next few hours, the two sides should provide the final formalities to close the deal and set a date for the presentation of the athlete."Ronaldo has scored 319 goals in 451 appearances over seventeen seasons with PSV Eindhoven, F.C. Barcelona, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, and AC Milan.On Tuesday, former manager of England's football team Roy Hodgson signed a two-year contract with London-based football club Crystal Palace, the club announced via their official website.70-year-old Hodgson has about forty years as a football manager, and has managed fifteen clubs, and four countries' national teams. He has managed four Premier League clubs — Blackburn Rovers, Fulham FC, Liverpool and West Bromwich, having 34.72 % win rate in Premier League. In 2011, he helped West Bromwich avoid relegation, and a year earlier, he helped Fulham to reach the final of the UEFA Europa League. Hodgson went on to manage England. Under his management, The Three Lions reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Euro 2012. In 2014's FIFA World Cup, England were eliminated in the group stage, and last year, following 2–1 defeat against Iceland in Euro 2016, Roy Hodgson announced resignation from the post. Hodgson has won seven Swedish league titles, two Swedish cups, and one league title each in Switzerland and Denmark.After penning the deal, Hodgson said, "This is very much the club of my boyhood and I remember in my youth watching the club from the terraces at the Holmesdale Road end which gave me such fond memories. In those days I had dreams of playing for the team, then as a coach you think about coaching the team and a lot has happened in between times." Regarding the poor start of the season, Hodgson said, "I don't honestly believe that there is necessarily a lot that needs to be done. You can always get off to a bad start, what we've got to remember is our fate will be decided after 38 games, not four."Hodgson's predecessor Frank de Boer's three-year contract was terminated the day before Hodgson's hiring, after his fourth consecutive defeat in the English Premier League. Crystal Palace was yet to score a goal, and they were nineteenth in the league table. Hodgson is now the oldest permanent manager in the Premier League. He is also the seventh manager of Crystal Palace in the past six years.Hodgson's first match as Crystal Palace's manager is to be an away match against Southampton FC, scheduled for tomorrow.Today in the opener of 2018 FIFA Football World Cup game host nation Russia defeated Saudi Arabia 5–0 at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.

Both teams went into the game on highs, as United had thrashed Roma 7-1 during the week, and Watford had defeated Portsmouth 4-2 in the Premiership.  With that confidence boost for Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd, Watford sported an attacking lineup with Hameur Bouazza and Tamas Priskin as strikers.  United's recent injury troubles allowed Alan Smith to play as strike partner to Wayne Rooney with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on the bench.The first chance in the match fell to United, and the Red Devils capitalized.  A long ball by Carrick was left by both Smith and Giggs before it came to Rooney, and he cut inside before blasting a shot high to the right of Richard Lee, giving United an early lead.  Watford were not dispirited by the early goal, and soon began to create chances through set pieces.  A flailing boot by a Watford player in the area connected with Edwin Van Der Sar's recently healed nose, and the big Dutch keeper had to have splints put in before play could continue.  Watford took advantage of the stoppage to catch their breath, and scored as soon as play resumed when Hameur Bouazza's side footed volley caught Van Der Sar unaware, and crept in off the crossbar after deflecting off Gabriel Heinze.  United's response was nearly instant, as Smith's pass into Rooney released him on the right.  After Lee nearly blocked a pass into Ronaldo, the Portuguese winger was able to bobble the ball home, scoring his twenty-first goal of the season, and restoring United's lead.  Gavin Mahon then had a chance to equalize again for Watford, but his side footed volley was saved by Van Der Sar.  Ronaldo then had a chance for his second as he was released by Rooney, but a last ditch tackle by DeMerit kept the scoreline at 2-1.  A groin injury for United's Rio Ferdinand then forced Alex Ferguson to replace him with Darren Fletcher, a move which saw a shuffle in the entire back line.  Rooney then had a chance for a brace, but his hard shot was palmed away by Lee.Watford started the second half strongly with Bouazza nearly scoring off a long throw, but his side footed effort went just wide.  Alan Smith then set up Rooney's second goal of the match as his curling cross was easily deflected in by Rooney's left foot.  Cristiano Ronaldo was then replaced with Kieran Richardson, and the substitute made nearly an instant impact, scoring United's fourth goal of the afternoon.  A well timed pass by Smith was met by the sprinting Richardson, and he easily chipped the ball over Lee and into the back of the net to secure a place in the final for United.Relegation bound Watford will meet Blackburn in the Premiership next, while United have a league game of their own at Old Trafford against Sheffield United.German team Werder Bremen won the DFB-Pokal (Germany's equivalent of the FA Cup) on Saturday night by beating Bayer Leverkusen 1–0. The win guaranteed Werder a place in the first Europa League and was their only piece of silverware this season. Werder has broken a streak of bad luck that was started by losing UEFA Cup to Shaktar Donetsk 2–1 after extra time. This was followed by a tenth-place finish in the Bundesliga via an "embarrassing" 5-1 defeat by champions VfL Wolfsburg.Bremen, determined to win, dominated the game on both sides of the ball, while Leverkusen seemed lazy and "lifeless". Leverkusen's best chance came after 22 minutes. Patrick Helmes found himself in front of the net with only Bremen keeper Tim Weise to beat, but he spectacularly failed to score. Bremen started pouring on the chances, with several coming just before the half. Bremen keeper René Adler had to push a header from Naldo just over the bar in injury time. The game was tied on 45 minutes.The second half started with a powerful shot from Tranquillo Barnetta that, unfortunately for Bayer, was easily saved by Wiese. Just four minutes later, the only goal of the game was scored. Mesut Özil took a shot from a rather severe angle. The shot bounced off of Manuel Friedrich's outstretched leg and into the net. Leverkusen tried to respond, but came up just short. Stefan Kießling seemed to have a legitimate chance after 79 minutes, but it was despatched by Sebastian Prödl. Leverkusen tried one last time to score during four minutes of injury time. They were helped when referee Dr Helmut Fleischer booked Hugo Almeida and Wiese for time-wasting. Two minutes into injury time, Kießling's head missed a cross by inches, and it sailed past him and out of play. By the time four minutes were up, Werder players were begging the referee to end play. Finally, after almost five minutes of injury time, Fleischer blew the whistle and the celebrations began in Bremen.The women's Pokal final was played earlier in the day. FCR 2001 Duisburg followed up their UEFA Women's Cup win with a 7–0 humbling of 1. FFC Turbine Potsdam. Five goals were scored in the second half.

Nigel Reo-Coker scored from a Chris Eagles cross on the 4th minute. Bolton continued their good start with a Darren Pratley shot being saved by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi. Wigan's Mohamed Diame equalized on the 40th minute with a curling effort into the top corner. Bolton went back in front in first half injury time, David N'Gog shot low to Al Habsi's right.Bolton had the first chance of the second half, Martin Petrov forcing a Wigan save. Wigan dominated most of the second half, Emmerson Boyce, Hugo Rodallega and Victor Moses all having chances. Bolton had a penalty on the 72nd minute but Al Habsi saved it. Bolton wrapped up the victory in injury-time when Eagles pounced on a Wigan mistake and drilled a low shot past Al Habsi.English footballer Adam Johnson has been arrested on suspicion of having sex with a girl under the age of 16.

The number of cars in the city is set to increase from 2.7 million to 3 million by the time of the Olympics. Country-wide, annual car sales are expected to reach 10 million annually by 2010.A good infrastructure is one of the International Olympic Committee's top priorities when searching for bid cities. The IOC requires that athletes, support staff such as coaches, venue volunteers, spectators, and the press all should be able to get from venue to venue without hassle.Existing plans in Beijing say that private cars may only drive in the city on alternate days. Plates with odd numbers would drive one day, while even numbered licenses would drive the next day.Wired magazine has suggested fuel-cell vehicles may be China's next cultural revolution.

Lane has repeatedly denied any guilt in the murder, maintaining she gave the baby to its biological father, a man she named as either Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris. Although there were extensive police searches, neither man has been located.The trial took seventeen weeks. Around 200 people were present in the New South Wales Supreme Court to watch Justice Anthony Whealy sentence Lane. In his two-hour sentencing remarks, Justice Whealy said he accepted the Crown's claim that Lane had deliberately killed her baby, whom he said had been murdered. "She must have found herself in a desperate situation and could see no way out," he said.Justice Whealey said that Lane did not have a mental illness; rather she had  a personality disorder that caused her to feel illogically trapped and isolated.  He noted that it was not known how the child died, but said the murder was not premeditated but rather  "spontaneous". He acknowledged that she was only 21 when the crime occurred and  referred to the case as  "the most profound tragedy" on multiple levels.Noting that Lane had been  rehabilitated and was now  a "very different person", he said, "The testimonials demonstrate that Keli has a unique rapport and successful relationship with young children generally."  The judge believed Lane posed no further threat to society and was unlikely to re-offend.Former Australian cricketer, Dean Jones was sacked by Ten Sports after he called South African batsman Hashim Amla a "terrorist" on air.Jones, who was a commentator for Ten Sports said "The terrorist has got another wicket.", in reference to Amla (a practising Muslim who sports a long beard) when the latter dismissed Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara during yesterday's match at Colombo.Gerald Majola, the chief executive of Cricket South Africa, said that Supersport as well as Cricket South Africa had received several angry calls in response to Jones' comment.

There had been wide speculation about McGwire's use of performance-enhancing drugs, as he came from an era of baseball that has been dubbed the "steroid era" because of the high use of performance enhancing drugs throughout Major League Baseball."I wish I had never touched steroids. It was foolish and it was a mistake. I truly apologize. Looking back, I wish I had never played during the steroid era...I shouldn't have done it and for that I'm truly sorry...It's time for me to talk about the past and to confirm what people have suspected," said some of the statement released by the St. Louis Cardinals today. McGwire had recently been hired as the Cardinal's hitting coach and was set to begin the job this season.McGwire, 46, had been regarded as one of the most powerful hitters of his time. Over his career, McGwire hit 583 home runs, which is currently tied with Alex Rodriguez, who has also admitted to steroid use. McGwire is now one of the six players in the top 15 home run hitters of all time that has either confessed to or been linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs.McGwire's best season came in 1998, when he set the record for most home runs in a single season. After a race throughout the final months of the season with Sammy Sosa, he ended with 70 home runs, easily beating Roger Maris's previous record of 61 (This record was later broken by Barry Bonds, who now holds the current record of 73)."I'm sure people will wonder if I could have hit all those home runs had I never taken steroids. I had good years when I didn't take any and I had bad years when I didn't take any. I had good years when I took steroids and I had bad years when I took steroids," said McGwire to the Associated Press. According to McGwire, the steroids were used for the enhancement of his play as well as to recover from the several injuries that he suffered between the 1990 and 1994 seasons.In the statement, he also commended the MLB Player's Association for attempting to remove steroids from the game. "Baseball is really different now— it's been cleaned up. The commissioner and the Player's Association implemented testing and they cracked down, and I'm glad they did," McGwire stated." Since he used the steroids before the current rules were in place, McGwire will likely not be disciplined by the league or the MLBPA.In 2005, McGwire was called to the U.S. Congress and refused to answer questions about his steroid use, saying that he did "...not want to talk about the past." It is unknown if the MLB will investigate into this matter.Mark McGwire is currently tied for eighth on the all-time home runs list. he played 16 Major League seasons and retired following the 2001 season. He is currently the hitting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals.Byron Moreno, a former Ecuadorian football referee who officiated at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, has been arrested for suspected drug smuggling.  Moreno was arrested at John F. Kennedy International airport after he arrived on a flight from Ecuador.During a routine check, security found 10 clear bags containing nearly 10 pounds of heroin. The drugs had been strapped to his body and concealed in his underwear. In a complaint filed in a Brooklyn federal court it said that during the inspection Moreno "became visibly nervous." It also said "A customs agent felt hard objects on the defendant's stomach, back and both of his legs. A strip search revealed that the lumps were 10 clear plastic bags containing more than 10 pounds of heroin".A judge jailed Moreno without bail on charges of drug smuggling. Moreno is most well remembered after he refereed the World Cup second round match between Italy and host's South Korea. Moreno had disallowed a valid Italian goal and sent off Italian striker Francesco Totti for apparent diving. He also failed to call any attention to any of the South Korean's foul play. Moreno resigned from refereeing in 2003.Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the F.A., the governing body of football in England, has made new allegations of widespread corruption within the FIFA election process for the 2018 World Cup. The allegations are the latest in a line of embarrassments for FIFA, who have already been forced to ban two members of the executive committee after they were exposed in a bribery investigation.Speaking to a Parliamentary committee, he said four members of the panel which decided who would host the 2018 tournament approached him demanding "bribes" for their votes. Triesman—who ran England's failed campaign to host the 2018 World Cup—said the demands were "below what would be ethically acceptable". He alleged Jack Warner, the vice president of FIFA, demanded £2.5million for his vote; and Nicolás Léoz, the member for Paraguay, said he wanted a knighthood. However, Warner said the allegations against him and the three others made by Triesman were "nonsense". He told Sky Sports News: "I've never asked Triesman nor any other person, Englishman or otherwise, for any money for my vote at any time." But the new allegations are the latest in a line of corruption claims to rock FIFA—last year the organization banned Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, both executive committee members, from voting in both the 2018 and 2022 race after a corruption probe; four others were also banned from voting. John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Parliamentary committee, said he would be writing to Sepp Blatter, the FIFA president, to demand an investigation into the allegations "as a matter of urgency". Blatter said he was "shocked" to hear of the claims, and said that after reviewing the evidence submitted to the committee he would "react immediately against all those in breach of the ethics code rules."Today, in a separate development, members of parliament published evidence obtained by The Sunday Times alleging that two other FIFA executives—Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of Côte d'Ivoire—had taken bribes of £1million to vote for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup, which it ultimately did. Russia won the bid to host the 2018 World Cup.Juan Antonio Samaranch, former head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has died in Barcelona at the age of 89.A former diplomat and Spanish ambassador in Moscow elected to the IOC in 1980, Samaranch was largely credited with the renewal of the Olympic movement over two decades marked by boycotts, bribery and drug scandals.  While appearing to be small in stature and uncomfortable speaking in public, he was viewed as an often ruthless operator who could forge consensus within an often fractious Olympic movement and bring IOC members to deliver what he wanted.Samaranch was admitted to hospital on Sunday with heart trouble and died at approximately 11:25 UTC, marking one of a number of occasions he has fallen ill.  Even in retirement, with advancing age and medical issues, Samaranch continued to travel and be active in Olympic circles, working to try and secure both the 2012 Olympics and 2016 Olympics for Madrid as well as attending various sport conferences."I cannot find the words to express the distress of the Olympic Family," current IOC president Jacques Rogge was quoted as saying, also making mention of the personal inspiration he drew from Samaranch.During his time in office, Samaranch worked to help increase the number of participating countries at the Olympics, oversaw the creation of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the creation of the IOC Athletes Commission.Prior to his election to the role of IOC president in 1980, he had a long background in sports, having held roles with the Spanish Skating Federation, Spanish National Olympic Committee and as Chef de Mission at the games in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Rome and Tokyo.On Friday, former Irish footballer Liam Miller died aged 36, his first professional club Celtic FC said.

Law enforcement officials said that Donaghy allegedly placed his own bets, and also released confidential information to others, including referees' schedules. Today, Donaghy pleaded guilty to 'conspiracy to engage in wire fraud' and 'transmitting wagering information to other individuals'. These two charges could result in up to 25 years in jail.Tim Frank, a NBA spokesman, told the Associated Press the league was informed yesterday that Donaghy would plead today but was not given any further information.Both John Lauro, Donaghy's attorney, and federal prosecutors did not comment. But, NBA commissioner David Stern said a month ago that the ex-referee's lawyer told the league Donaghy was contemplating a plea. The plea was made official early today.Donaghy has been reportedly cooperating with prosecuting attorneys who together are building a case against other people to whom Donaghy may have provided inside information to. It has also been reported that Donaghy had a biased view against the Detroit Pistons, therefore making bets against them, and then calls against them as wellDonaghy today told the court that he had a gambling problem. However, he also said that he was receiving treatment for it.The Associated Press reports that no other NBA officials or players are suspects in this case.The FBI contacted the NBA on June 20, 2007 to talk about a referee who was allegedly gambling on games. The FBI and the NBA officially met on June 21. Donaghy resigned from his position July 9, after over ten years as a refereeSteve McNair, former National Football League (NFL) quarterback was found shot to death in an apartment in Nashville, Tennessee, in the United States, around 1:00 PM on July 4, 2009. Sahel Kazemi, a 20-year-old woman, was also found dead with a gunshot wound in the same apartment. A gun, presumably the murder weapon, was found next to Ms. Kazemi's body. The Tennessean newspaper is calling the death "an apparent murder-suicide."McNair played 13 seasons in the NFL, 11 with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise, and two with the Baltimore Ravens.  Titan's owner "Bud" Adams said of McNair: "We are saddened and shocked to hear the news of Steve McNair's passing today. He was one of the finest players to play for our organization and one of the most beloved players by our fans."Kazemi was an employee of the Dave & Buster's restaurant in Opry Mills, Tennessee, and had been dating McNair for several months, according to The Tennessean.  McNair was still married to another woman at the time of his death.  Two days prior to their deaths, Kazemi had been arrested for driving under the influence in a black 2007 Cadillac Escalade which had been a gift to her from McNair.  He was in the car at the time of the arrest; he was not charged with any crime and later bailed her out of jail.The bodies were discovered around 1:00 PM on July 4, 2009 by Wayne Neely, a friend of McNair.  Another friend, Robert Gaddy, called police to report the deaths at 1:35 PM.  Nashville police are still investigating the deaths, and have not ruled out any scenarios.  However, they also state that they are not actively pursuing any suspects at this time.  They are awaiting an autopsy report on the two deceased before forming any conclusions about the situation.Canadian MP Belinda Stronach, 40, has reportedly cheated with Canadian hockey star Tie Domi. Domi and his wife were in court today getting divorced and both have now reached a temporary settlement in their divorce proceedings, less than an hour before the case was to be heard before Toronto's Superior Court. Stronach is refusing to comment on the divorce or say if she "wrecked" Domi's marriage."If it wasn't for my husband's affair with Belinda, we wouldn't be getting a divorce," Leanne told the Toronto Star in an interview last night. Domi's wife claimed that the former Toronto Maple Leaf player told her if she did not hire a lawyer he would give her $1 million in cash and a $1.5-million house if she kept quiet about his affair with Stronach. If she contacted a lawyer, however, she "would get nothing.""I'm not going to comment at this point in time whether it's true, it's false or it's just the opinions of others," Stronach said on CTV's Mike Duffy Live. "I'm not prepared to talk about my personal life at this moment."When Stronach was with the Conservatives she dated fellow MP Peter MacKay. In an interview in the Toronto Star on January 8, 2005, Stronach confirmed that she and MacKay were dating. Stronach, elected as a Conservative in the 2004 election, crossed the floor to the Liberal Party on May 17, 2005. She did not comment on what impact this would have on their relationship. On May 18, 2005, MacKay told the CBC that his relationship with Stronach was indeed over. Stronach crossed the floor from the Conservative party directly to Paul Martin's Liberal cabinet in May 2005. Stronach was previously married to Olympic speed-skating champion Johann Olav Koss of Norway, then divorced in 2005.Tie Domi said he would not comment on his personal life and his agent said Monday the hockey star would have nothing to say while the matter was before the courts. Leanne Domi's divorce application was filed on September 18, just one day before Tie Domi announced his retirement from the NHL.None of the allegations have been proved in court.Former Major League Baseball pitcher and coach Pat Dobson died of leukemia Wednesday, November 22.

The British Broadcasting Corporation made the announcement that he had died at 1030 GMT in Hawick, in the Scottish Borders — his chosen home town.McLaren started rugby commentating on a BBC radio station in 1953 while he was a reporter with The Hawick Express, a newspaper. He later moved to television commentary in 1959. He was awarded an MBE, an OBE and a CBE and retired in 2002. People have now paid tribute to the man who became known as the "voice of rugby". In a video shown on BBC News Online, HRH The Princess Royal can be quoted as saying that "[e]ven if you didn't think that you understood anything about rugby, somehow Bill McLaren gave you the confidence to listen to what he was saying. And he was always the same. He was clear, he was interesting and always unbiased."Some of Bill McLaren's famous quotes, or what The Daily Telegraph render "McLaren-isms", include McLaren saying that "[h]e kicked that ball like it were three pounds o’ haggis", "[m]y goodness, that wee ball’s gone so high there’ll be snow on it when it comes down" and "[h]e’s like a demented ferret up a wee drainpipe".Gavin Hastings, who was the former rugby captain for Scotland, said that "[f]irst and foremost, Bill was a very proud and passionate Scot but such was his professionalism that you would never really have known that.  He always remained very unbiased in his commentary and I think that that was unquestionably one of his endearing qualities.  He was a wonderful commentator and he just brought the world of rugby into so many people's homes."  John Thorbun, who is the secretary for Hawick Rugby Club, stated: "We're devastated, obviously — we've got a room named after him at the rugby club.  It was very close to his heart, Hawick Rugby Club.  He's a huge loss to rugby worldwide."Former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Eddie Griffin died on August 17, 2007, at age 25 due to injuries sustained in a car crash, the Harris County medical examiner's office confirmed on Tuesday. The former Minnesota Timberwolves forward, who was waived in March for violating the League's substance abuse program, ignored a railroad warning, drove his SUV through a barrier, and collided with a moving train at about 1:30 a.m., according to Houston Police. His vehicle caught fire and was soon engulfed in flames. No identification was found and the body was badly burned. For that reason, dental records were used to identify him. Griffin, who played college Basketball at Seton Hall University, played for the Houston Rockets from 2001–2003, and the Minnesota Timberwolves from 2004–2007. The five-year veteran had been battling alcoholism since leaving Seton Hall. He is survived by his three-year-old daughter Amaree.Yevgenia Tymoshenko has announced her mother, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, is to end her hunger strike after nineteen days. Yulia's lawyer, Serhiy Vlasenko, cited "what is happening in the country and what is happening to her in prison" as reasons for her commencing her fast. The politician is serving a seven-year sentence for abuse of office arising from a gas deal with Russia while she was Prime Minister. She has accused jail guards of assaulting her while transporting her to a hospital against her will to get treatment for back pain which she has reportedly been experiencing for months. In the incident, Vlasenko said Tymoshenko "naturally got scared, began resisting, after which she received a punch in the stomach and passed out", referring to a bruise which remains present on her body. Adherents of Tymoshenko have publicised pictures showing bruising on the politician's body. Corrections officers have refuted claims of their responsibility. Kharkiv regional prosecutor, Henadiy Tyurin, confirmed "she was picked up, carried to the car and taken to the hospital" but insisted: "According to the law ... the prison service has the right to use physical measures".Tymoshenko was scheduled to appear in a fresh trial for a tax evasion charge the day before she was taken to hospital. In theory, the hearing could have her imprisonment extended to the year 2023. The trial has been postponed to May 21. She does not accept she broke the law as the boss of a Ukrainian gas company in the 1990s.Tymoshenko has refused to accept medical treatment from Ukrainian doctors for her back problems, but has been given permission to travel from her current prison in Kharkiv to a hospital in the same city yesterday. There she is to be assisted by German doctor Lutz Harms, who is to "begin bringing [her] out of her hunger strike", Yevgenia explained. At the time of her going on hunger strike, Vlasenko spoke of Tymoshenko not having the ability to leave her own bed.Yevgenia described how her mother "appears to have lost 10kg [22 lbs], her temperature has dropped significantly and she may pass out any minute now". Due to the hunger strike, it was considered "impossible to start treatment immediately", she said.In the hours prior to this announcement, the Ukrainian government postponed a European summit scheduled for May 11–12 in the city of Yalta due to what the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described as a "connection with the fact that a number of European leaders [being] unable to take part in the Yalta summit for different reasons". At least ten leaders, including the presidents of the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria and Germany, reportedly reversed their decisions to appear at the summit in relation to the treatment of Tymoshenko.Ukrainian UEFA Euro 2012 football matches scheduled for June may also be boycotted by leaders, according to BBC News Online. The European Commission has stated its commissioners will refuse to attend Ukraine-hosted Euro 2012 matches. The German government has clarified that what happens to Tymoshenko will influence whether or not its representatives will appear at the matches. Tymoshenko denies abuse of office charges, believing them to be part of a campaign by President Viktor Yanukovych to prohibit her from politics. The European Union and the United States strongly criticised the conviction as they believed it is politically influenced.In the 2010 presidential elections, she was narrowly beaten by Yanukovych. Tymoshenko was also the leader of the Orange Revolution, which removed power from Yanukovych after he won the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election amid electoral fraud.In a letter, Tymoshenko appealed to Europe to persist in pressuring Yanukovych because Ukrainian citizens "cannot fight [Yanukovych's government] on their own" and "Ukraine may simply never have fair elections again", she claimed. She had earlier spoke of her belief that Yanukovych was vengeful.Scottish darts player and former world champion Jocky Wilson died last night, two days after turning 62. He had been suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung ailment, and police attributed his death to medical causes.Born John Thomas Wilson in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Wilson worked locally as a miner, at a bar, and in a fish processing factory before becoming a professional darts player in 1979. Three years later he won the World Championships, repeating that accomplishment in 1989.Wilson turned to darts after winning £500 at a tournament in 1979, enough to eliminate his right to state unemployment benefits, and was a highly ranked player by the start of 1980. Between 1979 and 1991 he never failed to reach at least the quarter-finals of every world championship, retiring in 1995. He was the first Scottish world champion.Each world championship victory came against a great rival, the first over John Lowe and the second against Eric Bristow. Bristow was five sets to nil down with six needed to win, but fought back to a tight conclusion. Wilson also had victories in the Finland Open, Scottish Masters, and British Open tournaments.Toothless for decades, Wilson also suffered diabetes, high blood pressure, and depression. He grew famous not just for darts but also for drink: he narrowly lost one match and then fell off the stage before victor Dave Whitcombe could shake his hand. He was later banned from darts and bankrupted when he left the British Darts Organisation to join the new, breakaway World Darts Council, triggering legal battles.Following his retirement he became reclusive, living in a small flat in Kirkcaldy and rarely being seen in public; voted into the Darts Hall of Fame in 1996 it took two years before he was found to present his commemorative plaque. "It's a sad day for darts", remarked Raymond van Barneveld, who has won the championship five times. "It was a shame he wasn't involved in darts anymore because he was such a hero." Wilson opted to live on state benefits after retiring instead of playing darts despite offers of good money."It's very sad news... He was such a good laugh to be with. People talk about the great characters in darts and he's one of the greatest", remarked Phil Taylor, who has won fifteen world titles. "Jocky transcended the whole spectrum of life in the UK", said Wilson's ex-manager Tommy Cox. "It's a very sad day because Jocky was loved by so many people for the great character he was." A minute's applause was held at today's UK Open Qualifier in his memory, with officials and 194 players joining in. He leaves a wife and three children.Former World Wrestling Entertainment superstar Jeff Hardy has been arrested on five major drug charges.

However, its relationship with Formula 1 has not always been rosy. Video rights to Formula 1 are under the strict copyright of Bernie Ecclestone's FOM concern. Videos of Formula 1 footage posted on the website are soon challenged and removed, however once removed they are soon replaced, due to the sheer number of videos on the site.USF1 team principle Ken Anderson was positive about the deal, noting that Hurley's business acumen and experience in setting up a global brand from scratch can be applied to the fledgling team. Autosport have also revealed that veteran drivers Alexander Wurz and Pedro de la Rosa may be in the running for a seat alongside "an American rookie". Austrian Wurz has not competed in Formula 1 since 2007 (For Williams in China), and de la Rosa has not raced competitively in F1 since 2006, when he replaced Juan Pablo Montoya at McLaren mid-way through the season.The other two new entrants for next year, Campos Grand Prix and Manor Motorsport are yet to announce any investment or sponsorship agreements.Hurley's involvement is unlikely to see the YouTube logo added to the car as this is a personal involvement independent of his current position with YouTube.Fernando Alonso has secured himself the pole at the British Grand Prix in Silverstone, UK.

News of his death was announced by his family the following morning:This is the first F1 race-related driver death since the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, when Ayrton Senna was killed.On October 5, 2014, at the late portion of the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka Circuit, Bianchi collided with a tractor crane that had been attending to the crashed car of Adrian Sutil. Bianchi's helmet became wedged underneath the tractor, causing a diffuse axonal injury, and he fell into a coma. After being treated at a Japanese medical centre, he was moved about two months after the accident to a hospital in Nice. Placed in the intensive care unit, in December he began rehabilitation therapy. Bianchi's father, Philippe, described his non-progress as a "daily torture".Bianchi, the 2007 French Formula Renault and 2009 Formula 3 Euro Series champion, was the inaugural member of the Ferrari Driver Academy. He joined F1 team Force India in 2012. In 2013, he joined Marussia F1; the following year, at the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix, he scored his and Marussia's first points with a ninth-place finish.After the accident, the FIA, which sanctions Formula One racing, formed a panel to investigate the crash. Afterwards, the group revealed its findings: as Bianchi entered the run-off area of the track, he disabled the failsafe mechanism by "[applying] both throttle and brake together, using both feet", while his front wheels were locked; the panel also stated he did not slow down enough to control his car. Eventually, F1 mandated the use of the "virtual safety car", which requires drivers to enter the pit lane at slower speeds instead of proceeding around the track.This is the Bianchi family's second driver death. Lucien Bianchi, the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans winner and Jules's great uncle, was killed in 1969 during testing at Circuit de la Sarthe, where the 24 Hours of Le Mans race is held.Upon the news of his death, many drivers sent their condolences through social media. Bianchi's Marussia team mate Max Chilton tweeted, "No words can describe what his family and the sport have lost. All I can say [is] it was a pleasure knowing and racing you."Formula One looks set to enter an era of standardised engines. The FIA is meeting with teams in Monte Carlo and is expected to approve the use by some teams of a standardised power unit provided by Cosworth, an automotive engineering company, from 2010 onwards. The move to a standard engine, which is common in lower tiers of open wheeled racing such as GP2, was pushed for by FIA President Max Mosley earlier this year as he aims to reduce team costs. This would not see the exclusion of manufacturer made engines, as at this time participation in the system would be voluntary and teams would be free to build licensed Cosworth engines or their own powerplants but on a performance par with the Cosworth unit. Mosley has stated that stabilising Formula One means that the FIA "...must stabilize the system with a base engine which anyone can have and which is inexpensive, as well as a standard gearbox" and has warned of future budget problems, saying that "Honda pulled out because of falling car sales and there is no guarantee that these falling sales, which affect all manufacturers, will not drop further".Ahead of the meeting of the FIA there have been rumours in the Italian press that Formula One team Renault had broken with the Formula One Teams' Association (FOTA), rumours which Renault has strongly denied. FOTA was established earlier this year by the teams to negotiate with the FIA over cost cutting measures and other changes, changes it hopes will stop the introduction of compulsory standardisation of engines and other parts on F1 cars. The FOTA's position was hard hit last week by the announcement by Honda that they were leaving F1 due to the economic crisis, a move which has caused many teams to re-assert their commitment to a future in Formula One. David Richards, whose Prodrive entry to Formula One was called off last season due to costs, highlighted what he sees as the need for fundamental changes, saying that Honda's exit was 'a salutary lesson for the whole of F1 that things are going to have to change, and everything is going to have to come back a little bit if the whole sport is to prosper in the future'.Five teams have reportedly expressed an interest in the Cosworth engines from the 2010 season, the five being all four independent teams (Williams, Force India, Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso) joined by manufacturer Renault. If only four teams sign up to the idea, the FIA has announced it will go ahead. Renault have been highly vocal in criticising the failure of the engine development freeze that has existed in Formula One and have, after a couple of seasons of struggling, been under pressure from their parent company to justify the continued expenditure in Formula One. Cosworth have previously been prolific engine suppliers in Formula One, their last stint was supplying engines to Williams in 2006.The talks come as many of the Formula One teams are in Jerez for part of their winter testing regime, with potential Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Buemi topping the time sheets for the first two days.Formula One was in disarray last night after eight members of the F1 Teams Association (FOTA) announced they are going to set up a rival championship to the current series next season.The reason for this drastic move is Max Mosley's plan to introduce a voluntary £40 million budget cap in order to make it easier for new teams to enter & existing teams to continue.The association refused to agree to this, worried it would result in two divisions. After a four hour meeting last night, Brawn GP, Ferrari, McLaren, Renault, Toyota, BMW Sauber, Red Bull Racing and Toro Rosso announced their decision.A FOTA statement read the following: "Since the formation of Fota last September the teams have worked together and sought to engage the FIA and commercial rights holder (Bernie Ecclestone), to develop and improve the sport.  Unprecedented worldwide financial turmoil has inevitably placed great challenges before the F1 community. Fota is proud that it has achieved the most substantial measures to reduce costs in the history of our sport. In particular, the manufacturer teams have provided assistance to the independent teams, a number of which would probably not be in the sport today without the Fota initiatives.  The Fota teams have further agreed upon a substantial voluntary cost reduction that provides a sustainable model for the future.  Following these efforts, all the teams have confirmed to the FIA and the commercial rights holder that they are willing to commit until the end of 2012. The FIA and the commercial rights holder have campaigned to divide Fota. The wishes of the majority of the teams are ignored. Furthermore, tens of millions of dollars have been withheld from many teams by the commercial rights holder, going back as far as 2006. Despite this, and the uncompromising environment, Fota has genuinely sought compromise. It has become clear, however, the teams cannot continue to compromise on the fundamental values of the sport and have declined to alter their original conditional entries to the 2010 world championship."McLaren driver Jenson Button won the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday and took a ten point lead in the driver's championship in the 2010 Formula One. Teammate Lewis Hamilton finished second in the race, followed by Nico Rosberg for Mercedes."It was a tricky race out there and again we called it right," Button commented. "It was not just about being quick, it's about reading the conditions."Ferrari's Fernando Alonso initially took the lead. He was penalized for starting before the race commenced and given a drive through penalty. He finished fourth as he entered the pit lane four times. Alonso initially took a lead in his Ferrari, but was later penalized for beginning before the race commenced. Rosberg's teammate, Michael Schumacher finished tenth in the race.Admitting that his performance was disappointing, Schumacher said that the race was one of the "frustrating" ones. "There were some good emotions but there were too many bad. Quite honestly the whole weekend did not work out for myself," he added.Felipe Massa of Ferrari slipped to sixth from the top position in the driver's championship after a ninth-placed finish. Renault's Robert Kubica was fifth while his teammate Vitaly Petrov finished seventh.Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull who had taken the pole in qualifying to the main race changed to wet tires and then reversed his decision and finished sixth as a result of this. Mark Webber of Red Bull adopted a similar strategy and finished eighth.After four races this season, Button is at the top of the driver's championship with 60 points, followed by Rosberg who has 50 points. Hamilton and Alonso are third with 49 points each.McLaren now leads constructors' standings, with 109 points. They are followed by Ferrari with 90, Mercedes with 78, and Red Bull with 73.Formula One racing team Renault F1 has dismissed Nelson Piquet, Jr., whose father Nelson Piquet, Sr. won the world championship three times, after his failure to obtain any points this season. WilliamsF1 have separately announced that they will not allow Michael Schumacher to practise with the current car of rival Scuderia Ferrari as he returns after nearly three years of absence.Piquet released a statement criticising his former team and its manager, Flavio Briatore. "I feel a sense of relief for the end of the worst period of my career, I can now move on and put my career back on the right track, and try to recover my reputation of a fast winning driver," he said.Piquet said of Briatore "A manager is supposed to encourage you, support you and provide you with opportunities. In my case it was the opposite. Flavio Briatore was my executioner." He gained nineteen points last season but has failed to win any in the ten races of the 2009 season.Piquet and Renault are both looking to move ahead. Piquet is seeking a new team, while it is unknown who Renault will hire to replace Piquet.Schumacher, meanwhile, will not get behind the wheel of the current Ferrari car until his first race since coming out of retirement, the European Grand Prix on August 23 in Valencia, Spain. Ferrari had written to the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), as well as the other eight members of the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) hoping to have him exempted from a ban on in-season testing.Schumacher's last F1 race was in 2006. Since confirming his comeback he has had a chance to practise in a 2007 Ferrari race car, but new technology featured on the modern version remains unused by Schumacher.Seven members of the FOTA agreed Schumacher should be exempted but Williams saw no reason to do so. Williams pointed out that 19-year-old F1 newcomer Jaime Alguersuari got no chance to practise with a modern F1 car before his first race."While we welcome Michael Schumacher back to Formula One, the fact is any form of in-season circuit testing is strictly prohibited, a regulation clearly laid out by the FIA and adhered to by all of the teams," explained the team. "It was for this reason Alguersuari … did not have the opportunity to familiarise himself with the Scuderia Toro Rosso [team's car] before he made his race debut."Schumacher, seven-times world champion, has returned to his old team to fill in for Felipe Massa, who suffered life-threatening head injuries after striking a spring which had detached itself from Rubens Barrichello's Brawn GP car. Massa was flown back home to Brazil today and said he was looking forward to life returning to normal, as well as to racing his Ferrari F1 car again. He remembers nothing of his high-speed crash.Four National Basketball Association players have been suspended indefinitely for their actions during a brawl at the end of the Friday, November 19th game between the Detroit Pistons and the Indiana Pacers. Ron Artest, Jermaine O'Neal and Stephen Jackson of the Pacers and Ben Wallace of the Pistons learned of the length of their suspensions on Sunday. Ron Artest has been suspended for the rest of the season, Stephen Jackson for 30 games, Jermaine O'Neal for 25, and Ben Wallace for 6. Pacers guard Anthony Johnson received a 5 game suspension. In addition, Reggie Miller from Indiana, and Detroit Pistons Chauncey Billups, Elden Campbell and Derrick Coleman were each suspended one game for leaving their bench. The brawl began with 45.9 seconds left in the game, as Ben Wallace shoved Ron Artest after a particularly hard foul by Artest. That was settled quickly, but a fan then threw a cup at Artest as the referees were handling the aftermath of the fight, and Artest went into the stands, and began throwing punches. Jackson then joined in and began to throw punches as well. Due to the brawl the game was called, and ended with 45.9 seconds left. The Pacers were ruled the winner. Artest has had a history of suspensions before this incident. Last season he was suspended twice, once for leaving the bench during a fight, and once for elbowing Portland player Derek Anderson. He was suspended 5 times during the 2002-2003 season.It looks like baseball stars Manny Ramirez and Miguel Tejada might be traded after all. Several New York Daily News sources claim that Ramirez could go to the New York Mets as part of a four-team deal. However, budget constraints may complicate the trade. According to the Daily News, if this blockbuster deal is successful, the following trades could take place:Mets would get:Manny RamirezDanys BiazRed Sox would get:Miguel TejadaJoey GathrightOrioles would get:Matt ClementJulio LugoKris BensonDevil Rays would get:Andy MarteJae SeoKaz MatsuiFrance yesterday ended Ireland's dream of winning the Grand Slam - European Rugby's top title. The RBS Six Nations clash, which took place at Dublin's Lansdowne Road finished with the French team ahead on 26 points against Ireland's 19.After a French dominated first half, Ireland had a glimmer of hope as Brian O'Driscoll managed to get a try almost from nothing mid-way through the second half, sadly for the homeside, it wasn't enough as France responded with a second try to take them to 26 ponits.Yesterday, France defeated Croatia 4–2 in the final of 2018 FIFA Football World Cup to win the tournament for the second time. French teenager Kylian Mbappé became the second teenager to score in a FIFA World Cup final after Pelé did in 1958's tournament.Croatia dominated the ball possession, having almost twice as much as France. In the sixth minute, French defender Samuel Umtiti won a free kick in the defensive half. In the 17th minute, Croatian midfielder Marcelo Brozović committed a foul and the referee awarded France a freekick. Mario Mandžukić ended up scoring an own goal from Antoine Griezmann's assist, giving France an early lead. Domagoj Vida and Ivan Rakitić tried to equalise for Croatia, later, but their attempts were either blocked or went wide. In the 27th minute, French defensive midfielder N'Golo Kanté was shown a yellow card for a bad foul. A minute later, Ivan Perišić scored a left-footed shot from Vida's assist, equalising for Croatia. The sides were not tied to 1–1 score for long. In the 35th minute, the referee awarded France a penalty kick, after confirming with the video assistant referee. Ivan Perišić had a handball in the penalty area. Greizmann scored from the penalty, putting the ball in the left corner and sending Croatian goalkeeper Danijel Subašić in the opposite direction. Frenchman Lucas Hernández was booked by the referee in the 41st minute. The first half ended with France leading 2–1.In the second half, Griezmann missed a chance to score from Olivier Giroud's assist. France made their first substitution in the 55th minute, as N'Golo Kanté was replaced by Steven N'Zonzi. Just before the one-hour mark, Paul Pogba had a shot towards goal but was blocked and Pogba collected the ball, and on the second attempt, the French midfielder scored from the left-footed shot, doubling the lead for France. Kylian Mbappé scored the fourth goal in the 65th minute, from Hernández's assist. With this goal, Mbappé became the second teenager to score in a FIFA World Cup final. In the 69th minute, Mandžukić scored the second goal for Croatia, intercepting French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris' pass. However, Croatia could not catch up the two-goal difference, and the match ended 4–2, as France won their second FIFA World Cup.French coach Didier Deschamps became only the third person to win the FIFA football World Cup as a player and a coach. As a player, Deschamps won the World Cup in 1998, when he was the captain of the French team. Two years ago, the Deschamps-led French team ended up as the losing side in the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament, 1–0 against Portugal in the extra-time.After the match, Croatia's coach Zlatko Dalić said, "I congratulate France on their title [...] I have to congratulate my players, it was maybe the best game we played in these championships; we controlled the match but we conceded. Against such a strong side as France, you must not make mistakes. We are a bit sad but we have to be proud as well for what we've done."Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitić said, "We were the better team in the first half, we were attacking, but we were unlucky tonight. They scored four goals from their three shots on goal. But I congratulate France, they deserved it."Tournament top scorer Harry Kane won the Adidas Golden Boot award. The English striker scored six goals in the entire tournament. Belgium's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois won the Adidas Golden Glove award. Croatia's captain Luka Modrić won the Adidas Golden Ball prize.On the final day of individual competition at the 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships in La Molina, Spain, concluded today with the Giant Slalom, France pulled ahead of Austria to sit atop of the medal ladder with seven gold medals, two silver medals, and three bronze medals to Austria's seven gold medals, one silver medal, and three bronze medals.

[...] at 38 I feel now is the time to begin the next chapter in my life."The 38-year-old midfielder made his debut in the mid-1990s and played for West Ham United and Swansea City before he joined London-based football club Chelsea F.C. in 2001 for £11million. Spending thirteen seasons with The Blues, Lampard scored 211 goals in all competitions for Chelsea, a club record, in nearly 650 appearances for the club. Lampard won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two Football League Cups, and one each of UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.Lampard spent one season with Manchester City F.C. before moving to Major League Soccer club New York City Football Club. Lampard played 29 matches with the New York club scoring fifteen goals. Lampard has scored goals against 39 different Premier League clubs.Lampard won 106 international caps for England, scoring 29 goals and featuring in three FIFA World Cups — 2006, 2010 and 2014 — before retiring from the national team in 2014. He made his international debut in 1999 against Belgium.Lampard said he is to study for coaching qualifications. Lampard wore a blue coloured jersey for most of his career.In the early Olympic games, athletes used to run a mile and then recite a poem.  The first poet-in-residence of an English football team, Ian McMillan, remarked that football chants are like huge tribal poems.  Generally, though, sport and poetry have never seemed natural companions in human enterprise.  Until the New York Mets baseball team suffered in 2007 arguably the worst collapse in Major League Baseball history.  To describe the anguish fans felt, The New York Times turned to a poet, Frank Messina.  "Nothing was really representing the fan's point of view," Messina told Wikinews reporter David Shankbone in an interview.  "There's a lot of hurting people out there who can't express what happened."And to those who read the Times last Saturday, Messina wants you to know his father never apologized for raising him as a Mets fans.  "I never asked for his apology, and he never apologized, nor did he owe us one.  I was misquoted in the New York Times."  Messina's parents taught him about opposite ends of the spectrum of life.  "My mother was supportive even when I made mistakes.  She taught me to never give up no matter what vocation you choose in your life."  Whereas Messina's mother taught him to never give up, his father taught him how to die with grace.  He passed away from cancer in 2005.  "I got to see a man who accepted his fate. He was like the Captain of the Titanic. My mother was also calm. I was the one freaking out inside. I saw someone who had acknowledged his own demise, accepted it, and died at home. He was a tough old guy. It takes a lot to accept that; it takes a very strong person.  Some of the special moments toward the end was sitting with him and watching baseball games."It is baseball that has garnered Messina attention now.  He has performed in 32 countries and 40 states, and in 1993 he founded the band Spoken Motion, a spoken word band.  What is striking about Messina is that his work has branched two worlds that often don't interact: downtown coffeehouse denizens of poetry and the denizens of Shea Stadium.  It is Frank Messina who has personalities as diverse as Joe Benigno, the archetype of the New York sportscaster at WFAN, reflecting on love and poetry. "No one would question a poet writing about love for a woman," said Benigno, "but when you’re a fan of a team, the emotional attachment is even stronger...."   Benigno sounded similar to avant-garde writer and musician David Amram, who said Messina's poems paint "the stark beauty of the streets, the pain of 9/11, the joy of everyday life, the mysteries of love all fill the pages of this book. It's a feast of images and sounds that stay with you."  I spoke with the person Bowery Poetry Club founder Bob Holman called the "Rock n' Roll Poet Laureate" recently in Washington Square Park:DS:  You have received a good deal of attention recently.FM:Even though I'm not Michael Jackson or somebody, when people come up to me and introduce themselves and say, 'Hey Frank, my name is John,' I say, 'Hey John, my name is Frank' and they laugh.  It's a funny phenomenon.DS:  What goes through your head when that happens?FM:  I understand it.  I've gone to readings and concerts.  I look at it as human interaction.  Over the years I have performed in 32 countries and 40 states.  I've been doing this professionally since I was in my twenties, and before that since I was sixteen doing little tidbit poetry readings in coffeehouses.  The band I started in 1993, Spoken Motion, received a lot of recognition as a spoken word band born out of the New York spoken word scene.  I worked with some great musicians and performed around the world.  I remember signing my first autograph to a kid when I was 25 years old.  As time went on, I came out with books and CDs, and I became used to that kind of thing.  To me, the ultimate feeling of success as an artist, is to move somebody enough where they thank you.  When someone comes up and says, 'Frank, thank you, your work is great."DS:  You have a long career in poetry, but as of late the attention you have garnered is for the Mets-inspired work.  How do you feel about having a lot of your work overshadowed by the Mets work?FM:It's ironic.  Some of the greatest poetry has been born out of failure and the depths of adversity in the human experience.  Walt Whitman, the first great American poet, wrote about the Civil War.  He went looking for his brother, George Whitman, after he a telegram telling him his brother was injured in the South.  When he started out his poems were about beating drums, and blow, bugle, blow.  Real patriotic.  Then he started to see the real horrors of war. He was able to tap into the human condition and the situation at that time.   Eventually when he found his brother he had resolution.I experienced that kind of adversity during 9/11 being a civilian volunteer.  I loaded ferry boats in Jersey City across the river to deliver goods to Ground Zero.  I turned to Whitman to find some understanding of what is happening in the world right now.  When I wrote my 9/11-related poems, that was true adversity.  I realize baseball is just a game.DS:  Can you recite a stanza that expresses how you feel right now?FM:  This was a piece that the Times only quoted one stanza, but it's about preparation for a battle, and being prepared to either rise to the occasion, or go down:Do you know what it's liketo be chased by the Ghost of Failurewhile staring through Victory's door?Of course you do, you're a Mets fancaught in a do-or-die momentin late September at SheaAs one that's battled hardthrough many a broken dreamLet me say, "in order to rise to the occasionyou must be willingto go down with the ship",Have no fear, no hesitation,for Winning shall be it's reward!Don't let them get in your head!you've kept it up this longYou're a Mets fan in late Septemberand you'll fight til the glorious endCheer the team today;(your boys in orange and blue)Let them hear you shoutas they fight for what's mightily due(copyright Frank Messina; reprinted with permission)DS:  Sports fans aren't known as patrons of poetry.  Have you had interaction with 'new readers' through your Mets work?FM:  This one person who I never met took a picture of me and sent it to me in an e-mail.  The e-mail said, 'Frank, I have never bothered you during the game, but I just wanted to say thank you for your work and thank you for making some sense of the successes and failures and I wish you much success with your work.'Last year in my section at the stadium I had a banner that read We Know'.  That's all it said.  Then earlier this year these shirts started to come out that said, "Poet says We Know".  It was amazing.  We didn't use the banner this year, though, because we didn't know.  The team wasn't so far ahead that we knew.  Last year we just knew we were going to the playoffs; we knew we were going post-season.  This year we weren't sure.  We were walking on eggshells.There was a woman, a season ticket holder and a die hard fan.  She was staggered by the loss last year to the Cardinals.  Last year she came up to me during one of the games late in the season; she was so happy we were going to the post season.  By that point we had clinched it.  She handed me a shirt she bought at the stadium and she gave me a big hug.  With tears in her eyes she said, "Thank you, Mets Poet, thank you."  It's cool...it's like another family.DS:  Moments like that must make you realize you have touched people who aren't normally touched by poetry.FM:  It's opened up a new fan base, so to speak.  For the last year SNY has broadcast footage of me with my poems, so quite a few fans known about the 'Mets Poet'.  I have never called myself that, by the way.  The back of my jersey says 'The Poet' because growing up that was my nickname.  My brother was a runner and they used to call him The Birdman--Birdie--and they called me The Poet.  It was a natural thing, but I never coined myself as 'The Mets Poet.'DS:  Jack Nicholson once said, "The fuel for the sports fan is the ability to have private theories."  What are some of your private theories?FM:  The fan is always right.  No matter if he is wrong, he is right.  The fan always has an opinion.  That's why we have talk radio and people call Joe Benigno and Steve Somers and Mike and the Mad Dog all day long.  That's why we have 24/7 sports-related talk. If you were to come from another planet with only three hours on Earth to find out what human beings are like, to discover how dynamic life is as a human being, you would take them to a baseball game.  A season is like a life, but a game is like one day in that life.  A season has its beginning, its renewal, its innocence and its arch into maturity into the season.  Panic sets in when it hits the middle-age of the season.  Will it we have success, or will we have failure.  At end of season, fans have to accept whether we have failed or whether we have achieved victory.  Kansas City Royals fans know at the beginning of the season that, more than likely, nothing is going to happen for them.  As Mets fans, we want to win, but we never expect it to be easy.  It's always going to be a fight; it's always going to be hard.DS:  The second-class citizen in a first rate city idea that is found in one of your poems.FM:  Yeah, you're going to get pushed around.  People are going to disagree with you.  It's not going to be easy.  You're going to have to take a lot of pills, take an extra drink, go to the gym an extra day to run off some energy.DS:  You and poet Ron Whitehead embarked on a "War Poets" tour of Europe.  You as a pro-war poet, and Whitehead as a pro-peace poet.  Forgive the crude terminology; I realize there is probably nuance in there.  In the over four years since that tour has your outlook evolved at all?FM:  I've never been for any war.  I try to avoid altercation on any level, be it emotional, physical, or political.  But there are some wars I think that are necessary.  History has shown this.  Was this one necessary?  I don't know.  Twenty years from now we'll have to figure that out.  I hope that we've all learned something from it.DS:  What is your feeling toward the Iraq War now?FM: It's a mess.  It's a mess.  We went in to get a job done, get Hussein out of there, liberate the Iraqi people as was dictated in the 1998 Liberation Act that Senator Lieberman helped draft and President Clinton put out there.  President Bush, Congress and the American people supported going in there.  I'm not going to backtrack: I did support going in there, and even as an artist and a poet, and as a freak, I made a decision, that it was time to take this guy out.  I spoke with many Iraqi Americans who live in my neighborhood who also supported that.  Lebanese and Iranian friends I have supported it.  One of my childhood friends, Adel Nehme, came out of Beirut, Lebanon around 1972.  We met in kindergarten and we've been friends ever since.  He was someone who escaped that turmoil.  His family brought him to New Jersey specifically to pull him out of that hell, like the way my father took us out of the gangland hell of the South Bronx.  Like any father would do, to protect his family.DS:  Do you still feel the Iraq War is protecting us, and that the original reasons you supported it are still valid?FM:  It's a mess.  The original reasons?  Yes.  Looking back, hindsight is always 20/20.  Unlike many artists, I have vocally supported the war.  Many artists who support this war won't say that.  Ron Whitehead is a dear friend.  We have mutual respect for each other but we disagree on a lot of issues.  Nevertheless, there's only one man I want fighting in the trenches of life with me, and that's Ron Whitehead.DS:  When you look at the state of the world, what five descriptors come to mind?FM:  Chaos.  Yearning for peace.  Confusion.  Desperation.  Hope.DS:  And are you hopeful?FM:  Yes.DS:  Where do you get that hope from?FM:  My faith in the human spirit.  I think people are inherently good.DS:  Joe Benigno said, "No one would question a poet writing about love for a woman, but when you’re a fan of a team, the emotional attachment is even stronger, because women come and go, but your team never changes."  Do you think that analogy really holds, because you are attracted to the Mets, and you are attracted to women, and the players on both of those teams in your life change. FM:  Loving a baseball team is having to put up with the imperfections, the routine of what kind of mood is it going to be today.  It doesn't come down to whether we are going to win or lose, it comes down to: is the player going to perform this way?  Or , is the pitcher going to be ambivalent?  Am I even going to have enough strength to watch this game?  Am I going to wash my hands?  Am  I going to lay in bed all day?  What am I going to do?  The game becomes a reflection of true life in that way.DS:  The difference is that you know what to expect from the players on the Mets.  They have defined roles and there is some certitude.  With women, as the players change you don't know what they are going to do; whereas in baseball the players have roles and you know what to expect of them.FM:  It's a dangerous proposition being any fan, but particularly a Mets fan, because you are going to have to accept you will fall in love with imperfection.  When you fall in love with a woman, you are accepting them for all their flaws, those elements that make them human, worts and all.  And I accept my team worts and all.  They have given me a great deal of joy, a great deal of entertainment, exhilaration, and a hell of a lot of pain like in any fan.  This isn't the Brady Bunch, this isn't Leave it to Beaver.  Few things are, if anything.DS:  You were the recipient of the 1993 Allen Ginsberg Poetry Award.  In 1996 I met Ginsberg at the Naropa Institute in Boulder.  I asked him about NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association.  He told me to follow him into the bathroom.  As I stood there he peed and told me he wasn't for having sex with children, but that he thought that age-of-consent laws were outdated, that he knew what he wanted when he was fifteen and that he thought everyone does at that age.  He said he wasn't for sex with children, but that it should not be illegal to have sex at that age.  When you accepted the Ginsberg award, did you have an issue with some of his political stances?FM:  I was too young at the time to realize what he thought.  I never knew what went on behind closed doors with Allen, and aside from meeting him a few times, I never knew him on a personal level.  I accepted the nomination, like young people do each year, because of his poetry, not because of his politics.  I was proud.  That is what the award was designed for.  There are laws in this country for a reason, to protect children and to protect people from predators.  Whether Allen was a predator or not, I don't have any idea.DS:  All evidence is that he was not a predator, but that he was a voice for change of age-of-consent laws.FM:  To me, it's a non-issue.  Put your hand on my kid and believe me, it's all over for the predator.  That's my policy.  When someone's 18, that's the deal.  I'll stick with the law on that one.DS:  What's a lesson your mother taught you?FM:  To never give up.  She was supportive even when I made mistakes, as a good mother will do.  In school my parents were called up a lot.  It was not easy being a parent of Frankie.  Teachers were constantly calling.  I was disruptive, I would talk out of line, I was a class clown.  She taught me to never give up no matter what vocation you choose in your life.  My mother was never critical of my poems and writing.  We're good friends and she's a lot of fun.DS:  How would you choose your death?FM:  Either in battle or laying in bed with family around me.DS:  Have you ever had a moment where you saw your death?FM:  Yes, a couple of times.  Once I was on one of those small planes flying to Pittsburgh last year to see the Mets, actually one of those 25-seat airplanes flying out of Newark in a lightning storm.  We had ascended over Newark and the plane was struck by lightning.  There was no panic on the plane at all, but something, we knew, was terribly wrong.  I saw a flash of light when it hit the plane and a fellow across the aisle said, "Did you just see that?" and I said that I thought we were struck by lightning.  He said it felt like something got ripped off the plane.  There was so much turbulence.  The stewardess came out with one of the co-pilots, who announced we were struck by lightning, but that we were going to continue the flight.  There was a moment there, I think a good 30 seconds, where I was certain the plane was going to break apart.DS:  Did you have any realizations?FM:  I thought, this is it.  This is it.  There was acceptance.  When my father was diagnosed with cancer in June of 2005 and  I got to see a man who accepted his fate.  He died two months later.  He was like the Captain of the Titanic.  My mother was also calm.  I was the one freaking out inside.  I saw someone who had acknowledged his own demise, accepted it, and died at home.  He was a tough old guy.  It takes a lot to accept that, it takes a very strong person.  In this culture we value life very much, and some people look at death as a failure, but it's going to happen to all of us.  My theory is to help yourself, and help others in life.London, England— Frank Ponta was posthumously inducted into the Visa Paralympic Hall of Fame at a ceremony in London this week.Ponta, who died in June last year after a long illness, was inducted into the Hall of Fame for his work as a coach.

The final score was 163-44, the biggest win in AFL grand final history. The Geelong City Hall will be hosting a victory parade on Wednesday.Q1: Geelong 5.7 (57) to Port Adelaide 2.2 (14)Q2: Geelong 11.13 (79) to  Port Adelaide 4.3 (27)Q3: Geelong 18.17 (125) to Port Adelaide 5.5 (35)Q4: Geelong 24.19 (163) to Port Adelaide 6.8 (44)Today, at Winged Foot Golf Club, in Mamaroneck, New York, Geoff Ogilvy won the 106th U.S. Open with a score of 285, 5 over par. Jim Furyk, Colin Montgomerie, and Phil Mickelson all tied for second place one stroke behind at 6 over. Ogilvy, born in Adelaide, Australia took home almost $1.25 million dollars. Other notable scores include Vijay Singh at a tie for 6th at 8 over, David Duval making a comeback at a tie for 16th place at 11 over, Adam Scott at a tie for 21st at 12 over and Ernie Els tying for 26th at 13 over.Defending champion Michael Campbell of New Zealand, Retief Goosen, and Tiger Woods all missed the cut in the hardest U.S. Open in a long time - the worst Open on record was also at Winged Foot in 1974, where winner Hale Irwin shot 7 over. This was Tiger's first tournament since his father's death on May 9, although he said in a press conference that there was no excuse for his awful playing. Woods said of his poor playing, "I don't care if you had what transpired in my life of recent or not, but poor execution is never going to feel very good."Ogilvy came in to the clubhouse, almost sure of his second place. But Phil Mickelson's double bogey at the 18th hole gave Ogilvy a boost in the leaderboard, bringing him to first. He said later, "I thought, Make this and come in second in the Open on your own. I never thought Phil would make bogey at the last. He ended up making double, and it's got to be a hard one to swallow for Phil, because he's obviously been the outstanding player at majors in the last eight or nine months." Mickelson only hit 2 out of 14 fairways on Sunday and 24 out of 56 total. He managed to scramble out in the first three rounds, but the course fought back on Sunday. His tee shot at the final hole went far left. He played the shot very aggressively and ended up hitting a tree and putting the ball only 25 yards farther. It just got worse from there for Mickelson. His third shot ended up buried in the left greenside bunker. His fourth went back over the green and into the rough. He chipped out and one-putted for the catastrophic double bogey that cost him the championship. Ogilvy didn't win purely by Mickelson's double bogey, though. He saved par on the 17th with a chip-in from the rough, and overcame a few tough shots to save par at the 18th. His last two US Opens resulted in a missed cut in 2003 at a tie for 28th last year. His win this year at the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship set him up for the first Australian major win since Steve Elkington at the 1995 PGA Championship. Besides Mickelson, there are quite a few other contenders who are not going to forget today - or the vicious 18th hole - for a while. Colin Montgomerie made a remarkable comeback after a poor round yesterday, holing a 75-footer for birdie at the 17th hole. His second shot, from 172 yards away in the fairway, went far right into a very deep cut of rough. His third shot went 40 feet past the hole. He put his par putt 10 feet from the hole, missed that putt, and went on to also make double bogey. Jim Furyk hit a bunker shot to 5 feet on the 18th, but two-putted and came up one stroke short of Oglivy. Padraig Harrington, who ended up in sole fifth at 7 over, went bogey-free for 15 holes and bogeyed the last three to fall out of contention. And of course, there's Kenneth Ferrie, who started the day out tied with Mickelson for the lead. He just crashed the whole day, making 6 bogeys and no birdies to fall to a tie for 6th at 8 over.A summary? The Mickelslam is no more, and another newcomer has made his statement at the 2006 US Open. No one can deny that Winged Foot has provided yet again a challenge that has beaten even the best of players.The George Mason University Patriots of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) defeated the University of Connecticut Huskies today in overtime, 86-84. GMU becomes the first team from the CAA to reach the Final Four in a NCAA Division I basketball championship, and only the second 11th seed (LSU was the other in 1986). The Huskies were the number one seed in the Washington Region. GMU is also the first true mid-major to reach the Final Four since 1979 with Penn State and Indiana State. This year held the Patriots' first NCAA Tournament game victory, where they beat Michigan State (No. 6 seed) and the University of North Carolina (No. 3 seed) in the first two rounds. They defeated Wichita State in the third round, setting up today's match against UConn.Although GMU lost to the University of North Carolina - Wilmington in the CAA Championship bid, the NCAA selection committee awarded the team an at-large bid. This drew criticism from sports commentators such as Billy Packer, who felt it was more appropriate to give at-large bids to schools from major conferences, like the Big East, Big 10, or ACC. Packer argued that the tougher schedules during the regular season in those conferences gave more legitimacy to teams in those leagues.Both Georgia and Japan have qualifed for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France next October and November. The World Cup pools are now starting to take their final shape, with just two repechage positions remaining. 86 nations have attempted to qualify for next years' tournament.Georgia drew 11-all Portugal in the final leg of the last series of European qualification, however in the previous match, Georgia were victorious, thus on points, Georgia go through to France. Georgia join Pool D, where they will face Argentina, hosts France, Ireland and Namibia. Georgia have previously qualified for one other World Cup, the 2003 tournament in Australia. Despite Portugal's loss, their hopes to qualify are still very much alive, though they now face Morocco for the right to then face Uruguay to take out one of the two repechage spots in the World Cup.Japan defeated Korea 54 points to nil, this coming after their win over Hong Kong earlier in the week. Japan go through to Pool B, where they join Australia, Canada, Fiji and Wales. Japan have qualified for every World Cup since the first tournament in 1987. Korea (who have yet to debut at the Rugby World Cup) can also still qualify,  as they will now play Tonga for the second repechage position.According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, toxicology reports reveal that the former pro-wrestler Chris Benoit had ten times the normal level of testosterone as well as hydrocodone (a painkiller), and Xanax (an anti-anxiety medication).Benoit also reportedly tested negative for alcohol.Benoit's wife, Nancy Benoit also tested positive for Xanax, and the painkiller hydromorphone. Benoit's son Daniel could not be tested due to a lack of urine samples, but Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner who performed the autopsies on the bodies says that "Daniel Benoit was sedated at the time he died" and that "there's no reason why a seven-year-old child would be taking Xanax."Federal authorities have charged Dr. Phil Astin with improperly dispensing medication painkillers and other drugs to two other patients. Astin has pleaded not guilty.Hours before the Opening Ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympics, 21-year-old Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died after hitting an unpadded pole during a routine training exercise at the Whistler Sliding Centre in Vancouver, Canada on Friday morning.According to those on the scene, blood was "pouring" from the athlete's head as he was being placed into a stretcher. Doctors did try to revive him, but to no avail."Our first thoughts are with the family, friends, and colleagues of the athlete," Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), told international media.

Training was suspended until officials were able to certify the course as safe. The president of the ILF, Josef Fendt, said in a statement: "This is a terrible accident. This is the gravest thing that can happen in sport, and our thoughts and those of the luge family are naturally with those touched by this event."Mr. Kumaritashvili is the fourth athlete to die in Winter Olympic history.According to the Hannover Police Department, German international football goalkeeper Robert Enke died in the early evening yesterday. Enke had been crossing a railway at Neustadt-Eilvese and was killed by a train. Initial police investigations indicate suicide. The death of the 32-year-old soccer player from Hannover 96 has shocked the football world.Enke's daughter died in 2006 when she just two years old. There is speculation that personal problems led to Enke's suicide.Enke started his career in Jena and first represented his country in 1998 whilst playing for Borussia Mönchengladbach. He won eight full international caps for the German national team since 2007 and was part of the squad which finished as runners-up in UEFA Euro 2008. He was widely considered to be a strong contender for the number one spot at the 2010 World Cup.On Sunday, German footballer Mesut Özil announced retiring from international football via his official Twitter handle. The 29-year-old gave racism as the reason for his retirement.Özil and his international teammate İlkay Gündoğan, who are of Turkish origin, met the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in London in May. The two players took a photo with Erdoğan, after which, many Germans reportedly booed the players prior to this year's FIFA Football World Cup in Russia. Özil said that he received hate mail and threats after meeting the Turkish president.In his tweets, Özil said, "It is with a heavy heart and after much consideration that because of recent events I will no longer be playing for Germany at international level whilst I have this feeling of racism and disrespect. I used to wear the German shirt with such pride and excitement, but now I don't. I feel unwanted and think that what I have achieved since my international debut in 2009 has been forgotten."Speaking about his meeting with the Turkish president, Özil said, "Like many people, my ancestry traces back to more than one country. Whilst I grew up in Germany, my family background has its roots firmly based in Turkey [...] For me, having a picture with President Erdoğan wasn't about politics or elections, it was about me respecting the highest office of my family's country". Referring to the German football association's president, Reinhard Grindel, Özil said, "In the eyes of Grindel and his supporters, I am German when we win but I am an immigrant when we lose."Özil made his international debut on August 12, 2009, playing against Azerbaijan. Since then, he has featured in 92 matches for Germany, scoring 23 goals. Özil was part of 2014's World Cup winning squad."He [Mesut Özil] played a key role in Germany lifting the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 and so the DFB is and always will be incredibly grateful for his outstanding performances in Germany colours" ((de))German language: ‍Er hatte entscheidenden Anteil daran, dass Deutschland 2014 in Brasilien Weltmeister geworden ist.

It also said, "The DFB regrets Mesut Özil's decision to step down from the national team." ((de))German language: ‍Der DFB bedauert den Abschied von Mesut Özil aus der Nationalmannschaft. Özil's last match for Germany was against South Korea in this year's FIFA World Cup, which ended in a 2–0 defeat for Germany, as the 2014 winners failed to qualify for the knockout phase.By their own accounts yesterday and today, a number of journalists from German public broadcasters ARD and WDR were detained by Qatari police and secret service for fourteen hours and forbidden from leaving the country for five days while working on a story about the country's controversial win of the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Allegedly, the journalists were arrested while working on a documentary critical of FIFA (International Federation of Association Football) president Sepp Blatter. They were forced to turn over all materials to authorities, and their equipment was confiscated and damaged. Journalist Florian Bauer tweeted yesterday, "#Qatar2022 ahead of new criticism. Arrested in #Qatar, all material erased, equipment demolished. What is #fifa saying to this?"Qatar's controversial win of the 2022 World Cup hosting rights has been surrounded with claims of corruption among FIFA's leadership. FIFA held an investigation into the allegations relating to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids which found no major Qatari corruption, however the leader of the investigation, former US Attorney Michael J. Garcia, later claimed FIFA whitewashed the investigation's findings.While the investigation found ex-FIFA vice president Mohamed bin Hamman, a Qatari, had bribed officials in his 2011 FIFA presidential campaign, the report claimed these payments were not related to the Qatari World Cup bid. It was alleged shortly after by The Sunday Times that bin Hamman secured the Qatari with illegal vote swapping.The detainment of journalists investigating allegations of Qatar's corruption adds to the continuing controversy surrounding the 2022 World Cup, including human rights concerns following reports of deaths of over 400 Indian and about 400 Nepalese workers in Qatar during the time Qatar has been building the site for the competition.Mattamy Athletic Centre, Toronto, Canada —Germany defeated the United States and Canada defeated the Netherlands yesterday in the semifinals of the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship at the Mattamy Athletic Centre in Toronto, Canada.

But the joy the home crowd had after the spectacular start was punctured 6 minutes later by Paulo Wanchope. The Costa Rican striker broke through a static German defence to pass the ball neatly by Jens Lehmann. Klose, who had 7 goals for the team in the 2002 Korea/Japan World Cup, tapped in a second to again give the German side the lead with a quarter of an hour gone.During the game possession of the ball was dominated by the hosts who, while looking vulnerable on the break, looked like scoring whenever they went forward.They scored a third, Klose's second, on 61 minutes, when the striker was first to react to a rebound from his own header, which had been saved by Jose Porras.Wanchope kept the home team on their toes breaking the German defence for a second time but any chance of the Central American team pulling off a shock was ended when Frings' bullet hit the back off the net.The game was played in spirit, the only yellow card going to Costa Rica's Daniel Fonseca for a first-half challenge.Yesterday in Toronto, Canada at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship, four teams qualified for the semi-final rounds.

You could feel this enormous pressure because we're a Belgian team." Boonen thought that the picture of the photo finish in Ghent was "the most beautiful picture of the year."Steegmans and Boonen are not only countrymen, but also team-mates on the Belgian-sponsored Quick Step-Innergetic team. Boonen took the green jersey from Robbie McEwen, who came in sixth.There was a large crash with less than 3 km to the finish.

The awards are for distinguished services to Ghana.Georgina Wood, who became Chief Justice on June 15, 2007, received her award from President John Kufuor. She was given the Order of the Star of Ghana, the nation's highest award. Two others who received this award as well were Dr Paul Acquah, Governor of the Bank of Ghana and the Omanhene (King) of the Juaben Traditional Area, Nana Otuo Serebour II, a former head of Ghana's Statistical Service, for his contribution to industry and public service (traditional category).President Kufuor is quoted as saying at the award ceremony that  "Like the Olympic medalist, we should seek to surpass existing limits to set new records hitherto deemed unattainable. This way, Africa, including Ghana, can excel in the competition and thereby carve a dignified niche for itself in the Global Village."As Dr. Paul Acquah received the award, the audience shouted "The value is the same" which is the catchphrase for the Ghanaian cedi redenomination in process at present. Nana Otuo Serebour did a short Adowa dance much to the admiration of the audience. The loudest ovation was however reserved for Georgina Wood as she received her award.

One of the flags of Saudi Arabia which contains the shahadah, one of the five Pillars of Islam. Critics say that this is offensive. As a result, a protest in the Khost province of south east Afghanistan took place, where 100 people attended.One Afghan MP, Mirwais Yasini said, "To have a verse of the Koran on something you kick with your foot would be an insult in any Muslim country."The U.S. forces in Afghanistan indicated the balls were meant to be a gift to Afghan children. A spokeswoman said, "Unfortunately, there was something on those footballs we didn't immediately understand to be offensive and we regret that as we do not want to offend."This is not the first time the flag has been used on a football. In 2002, there were protests when a planned football was to contain the Saudi Arabia flag for the 2002 Football World Cup.Adam Gilchrist has compiled the second fastest Test match century in history during the second innings of the third 2006-07 Ashes Test match against England at the WACA ground in Perth.The Australian reached 100 runs in 57 balls, second only to West Indian Viv Richards. Richards scored his record century off 56 balls back in the 1985-86 series against England, in the Caribbean city of St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda.The now-third fastest century was off 67 balls by fellow Australian Jack Gregory against South Africa in Johannesburg 85 years ago.Gilchrist reached his half-century off 40 deliveries, and then proceeded to quicken the scoring rate, including hitting English left-arm orthodox spinner Monty Panesar for 24 runs in one over - a record for the most runs scored in one over in an Ashes test.With centuries from compatriots Michael Hussey, Michael Clarke, and large contributions from Matthew Hayden (92) and Ricky Ponting (75), Australia declared their innings late on day three at 5-527, a lead of 556. England require 557 to win, or need to bat for two-and-a-bit days to salvage a draw; a win to Australia will give the Ashes back to Australia after they lost them in England during 2005.Former champion Maria Sharapova of Russia saw her comeback attempt come to an early end, as Argentina's Gisela Dulko beat her, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Dulko faces 10th-seeded Nadia Petrova in the third round, after the Russian beat Shahar Peer of Israel, 6-3, 6-2.Second-seeds Roger Federer of Switzerland and Serena Williams of the United States have advanced to the third round of the 2009 Wimbledon tennis championships in London.Williams took advantage of her big serve and powerful ground strokes Wednesday as she dominated Australia's Jarmila Groth, 6-2, 6-1. Federer eliminated Spain's Guillermo García-Lopez, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4.Federer is trying to pass American Pete Sampras as the sport's most successful major tournament winner by capturing his 15th Grand Slam title.Eighth-seeded Victoria Azarenka of Belarus had an even easier time, dumping Ioana Raluca Olaru of Romania by the so-called "double-bagel" score of 6-0, 6-0.In men's play, fourth-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia beat Germany's Simon Greul, 7-5, 6-1, 6-4. His next opponent will be number-28 American Mardy Fish, a four-set winner over another Serb, Janko Tipsarevic (6-4, 3-6, 6-1 ,6-4).The intentions of Manchester United's new owner, U.S. sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer, for the club have been revealed. Although spokespersons for Mr. Glazer (including his son) have stressed that nothing has been finalised, it appears that he intends to raise ticket prices, income, profits whilst capping spending on player transfers.Mr. Glazer - who owns over 76.2% of the club's shares through his investment company, Red Football - enraged fans when he started to accumulate shares earlier this year in an attempt to gain control of the what amounts to the world's most successful football club. Manchester United has more fans, a higher market value, a more valuable and more widely recognised brand and is more profitable than any other football club in the world.To gain control of the club, Glazer used borrowed money and he is set to transfer this money to the club's books when he gains full control. The borrowed money will result in large interest repayments - pushing the clubs finances into the red. To counter this Mr. Glazer apparently intends to raise ticket prices by about 50% and to increase revenues by 52% to £245.6m (from £161.5m this year) over the next five years. Apart from ticket price increases, this jump in revenue will be achieved by a 61% jump in match day sales, a 13% increase in media sales, and a 76% rise in sales of merchandise and other commercial activities.As part of his plans, expenditure on player transfers will be capped at just £25m a year. This is a very low figure for a English football club endeavouring to win domestic and European trophies. Seven years ago the club spent £28m on players, since then expenditure in England on players has increased hugely.Top-seeded Glenbard East High School was expected to win the Class 4A Neuqua Valley High School Sectional championship on Friday night. Yet with a lot of determination and a strong defense, the Benet Academy varsity boys basketball team defeated the Rams 68–54. The game marks Benet's sixteenth straight victory this season, giving the Redwings a 26–3 overall record. It is also their first sectional championship since the 1982–1983 season, which was the last time Benet advanced to the Class AA state tournament; there they lost to Thornton Township High School in the quarterfinals.The Redwings' aggressive man-to-man defense certainly kept the Rams out of their comfort zone amidst the crowds in the sold-out Neuqua gym. As Benet forward Mike Runger said, "We made them play to their weaknesses instead of letting them get comfortable doing what they want to do.”Benet scored 71 percent of its shots in the first half, while Glenbard East scored only 27. While the Rams led twice in the first few minutes (3–0 and 7–5), the Redwings led 12–7 after the first quarter. A three-point shot made by Dave Sobolewski two seconds before the buzzer gave Benet a 27–16 lead at the end of the first half. Glenbard East desperately attempted a comeback in the second half, but Benet maintained a lead ranging from 10 to 18 points. Rams guard made four three-pointers in the fourth quarter, but to no avail. As Benet coach Gene Heidkamp said, "...we knew they were going to come at us and give us a ton of pressure. We were a long, long way from being comfortable at halftime."Benet will play Simeon Career Academy from Chicago in the supersectionals at Hinsdale Central High School on Tuesday night.London, England — The Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team, the Gliders, defeated the USA Thursday in a 40–39 thriller at the North Greenwich Arena. This semifinal victory advances the Gliders into the final, where they are to meet the winner of the day's match between the Netherlands and Germany. They are guaranteed at least silver. The Gliders won silver in Sydney in 2000 and Athens in 2004 and bronze in Beijing in 2008, but have never won the gold. The USA team is to meet the loser of that match to contest the bronze.The Gliders' quest for Paralympic gold medals began last week with a narrow 52–50 defeat of Brazil. The Aussies then crushed Great Britain 51–24. Australia had a loss to Canada 50–57, but bounced back to win against the Netherlands, 58–49. This advanced Australia to the quarter final, where the Gliders met and defeated Mexico 62–37. Team USA started by defeating France 63–24 in its first game. It then lost to Germany, 54–48. It came back and defeated Mexico 67–33. Team USA came from 21 behind to defeat China in extra time, and played Canada and won in the quarter final 67–55. The first quarter got off to an exciting start. USA had first possession and chalked up the first score. Kylie Gauchi responded quickly with a good shot, leveling the score. Then followed an exciting passage of play in which USA turned the ball over, but Clare Nott lost it on a bad pass. Shelly Chaplin then stole it back but Kylie Gauchi put it out of bounds. Clare Nott stole it back again, only to have Gauichi turn it over again. The USA took a shot at the basket from inside the paint, but missed. They then took a rebound and finally scored. A USA free throw extended their lead to 2–6. Thereafter both teams' shooting was poor, and the score was only 10–12 at quarter time. The second quarter started with Merritt scoring twice to give Australia the lead 14–12. A ferocious Australian defence saw USA's style severely cramped, and they turned the ball over a number of times. They also took too long to move the ball forward. The crowd included the familiar block of Gliders fans in yellow T-shirts. They made their presence felt, chanting "Defence, Gliders, Defence!" whenever USA had the ball. Unfortunately, the Gliders' poor shooting prevented them from fully capitalising on their superb defence, leaving the score tied at 26–26 at half time. In the third quarter, an early goal by Kylie Gauchi from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A series of steals gave the Gliders additional shots at goal, most of which missed, but USA had no answer to the Australian defence, with a series of timeouts and turnovers, and their shooting was even poorer. While the Australians relentlessly racked up point after point, taking a 32–26 lead, USA were unable to score at all until the last minute of the quarter. A hurried goal with seconds to go by Katie Hill saw the Gliders leading 38–28 at the last change.In the fourth quarter, the Australian defence remained taut, but the shooting remained terrible. In the final accounting, Cobi Crispin only made 3 out of 10 shots, and Amber Merritt only 4 out of 16. The Glider's most accurate shot turned out to be Clare Nott, who made four out of five attempts. Meanwhile, an increasingly desperate USA team pegged the Australians back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. Fouls saw Merritt sent to the free throw line, but she missed both shots. The game went down to the last second, with USA missing a shot from inside the paint, before the shot clock ran out.London, England— A 62 points to 37 quarter-final win against Mexico on Tuesday night saw Australia's Gliders go forward into the medal round in front of a four-thousand-plus crowd at the Greenwich North Arena.Winners of their group, Australia have never taken the gold in wheelchair basketball; their opponents, Mexico, were previously ranked ninth at the opening of the tournament, so making it thus-far boosts their ranking to eighth. They were, however, beaten by Australia 75 points to 45 in a pre-tournament warm up match.Australia's first shot at goal was taken by Bridie Kean, from the free throw line; but, she missed both shots. Mexico's Lucia Vazquez Delgadillo then became the opened the scoring to give Mexico a two-point lead, their biggest of the entire game. Seconds later, Cobo Crispin had a shot from the paint, but missed; Kylie Gauci then finally put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders.Mexico turned the ball over, and Cobi Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Kylie Gauci. This was repeated on the next play, with Sarah Stewart providing the assist. Mexico then scored, the Gliders responding with another shot from Cobi Crispin. On the next play, Kylie Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Clare Nott took a defensive rebound, leading to Cobi Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled. but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Sarah Stewart took another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14 points to 4. Mexico had great difficulty moving the ball up the court; suffering by timing out, or being forced into long shots that missed. But, when the same happened to the Gliders, Kylie Gauci, a two-point player, took a spectacular three point shot to take the score to 17 points to 8 in Australia's favour. Mexico then managed to score again before Amber Merritt came on with only three minutes left in the quarter, and missed her first shot at goal. A second attempt, coming from a pass by Kylie Gauci, put more points on the scoreboard.With only a few seconds remaining in the quarter, Kylie Gauci stole the ball and delivered it to Shelley Chaplin, who scored again. The two teams went into the quarter-time break with the score 21 points to 10.In the opening minutes of the second quarter, Shelley Chaplin assisted Cobi Crispin, and then Amber Merritt, to add another four points. Attempting to respond, Mexico missed two shots before scoring then, on the next play, allowed Amanda Carter to steal the ball, which led to Amber Merritt scoring again.Australia followed this up with steals by Cobi Crispin and Amber Merritt, giving Shelley Chaplin more scoring opportunities. Mexico scored twice; but, Australia responded each time, with goals by Amber Merritt and Amanda Carter, who was fouled, making her's a three-point play. A steal led to a runaway break by Amber Merritt, bringing her contribution to ten points, and the score to 38 points to 16.Mexico seemed unable to shake a pattern of turnovers and hasty shots, resulting in a 44 to 20 points difference at the half-time break.  In the third quarter, the Glider's intensity dropped off; A timeout, and a series of missed shots by Katie Hill, Brodie Kean and Cobi Crispin, gave Mexico a chance to stage a minor recovery by outscoring Australia for the quarter by one point, leaving the score at 50 to 27 at the end of the third quarter.The final quarter got off to an unimpressive start for both teams; Australia's Leanne del Toso missed a shot at one end, and Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal missed one at the the other. Sarah Stewart missed too before a Mexican turnover led to the first scoring of the quarter, by Sarah Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response, another shot by Sarah Stewart missed; but, Amanda Carter took an offensive rebound, which eventually made it into the basket. Turnovers by Bridie Kean and Leanne del Toso led Mexico putting points on the board consecutively, but successive fouls sent Bridie Kean to the free throw line to score three points. Amber Merritt brought the score to 59 points to 35 with her seventh scoring shot. By this point, Australia was deliberately running down the clock, passing the ball around, and taking shots at the last minute. This led to several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Katie Hill, with Mexico unable to capitalise on the opportunities. Under intense Australian defensive pressure, Mexico missed shots and turned over the ball as-often as before. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Katie Hill took a two point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw.Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, the final score of 62 points to 37 meant the Mexican team's Paralympic campaign was over.Australia must now confront the winner of tonight's United States versus Canada game on Thursday.London, England— Australia lost Sunday night to Canada 50–57 in the women's wheelchair basketball at the Olympic Park in London.Poor shooting doomed the Australian Gliders' hopes of a third victory in a row at the Basketball Arena; they only managed to make only 23 out of 68 shots at the basket, a miserable 34%. Only one three-pointer was attempted, by Amber Merritt. She missed the shot.The Gliders were down by eight points at quarter time; but, fought their way back into the game, tying at 40-all at one point in the third quarter.Both Amber Merritt and Cobi Crispin ran up large numbers of personal fowls: four for Meritt and five for Crispin, hampering Australia's game style. Nonetheless, the pair still contributed to the team's scoreline, with Crispin scoring 12 points with 15 rebounds, and Merritt scoring 16 points with six rebounds. Shelley Chaplin scored eight points with five rebounds and seven assists. The team's camaraderie was again on display.The other players in the Gliders Sarah Vinci, Bridie Kean, Amanda Carter, Tina McKenzie, Leanne del Toso, Clare Nott, Kylie Gauci, Sarah Stewart and Katie Hill.This was the Australian's third game in the Group A round-robin.

The International Olympic Committee voted to include the sports at its executive board meeting in Berlin today. Rugby, specifically rugby union, and golf were selected over five other sports to be considered to participate in the Olympics. Squash, karate and roller sports tried to get onto the Olympic program as well as baseball and softball, which were voted out of the Olympic Games in 2005. The vote must still be ratified by the full IOC at it's October meeting in Copenhagen.Golf will return after a 112-year absence from the Games; the sport was last played at the 1900 and 1904 Games. Rugby union, in its full 15-a-side version, was included in four Olympic Games, with its last appearance being in 1924. If the sports are included after the October meeting, rugby will return to the Olympics as rugby sevens, a version of rugby union with seven players per side and 7- or 10-minute halves instead of the standard 40-minute halves. Elite rugby director Rob Andrew said that "Rugby Union is played in more than 100 countries and has a superb opportunity to further develop and grow through its new partnership with the IOC."The format that has been proposed for golf is two 72-hole tournaments, one each for men and women, with 60 competitors each. The top 15 players in the world will qualify automatically and the major golf schedules will arranged around the Olympic Games. Not all were happy with the proposed inclusions to the game. IOC President Jacques Rogge defended the decision, saying that "this is the young generation that will be at its peak in 2016. The same question was raised time and time again when tennis and ice-hockey were introduced. Ask [top tennis players] Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, ask the NHL players, ask the NBA basketball players. They all want to go to the games — they are absolutely not concerned about that." One of the sports that lost out was squash. Squash Federation President N Ramachandran commented on his disappointment that squash was not included in the games. If the sports are included, they will first be conducted in the 2016 Games. Women's boxing is now set to appear at the 2012 Games.With a score that is three over par, defending champion Padraig Harrington has won the British Open, which took place this year in Southport, England.

Bowman was Australia's only rider in this event.Prior to entering the competition ring, Bowman's horse Kirby Park Joy was in poor form, with Bowman unable to get control of her, showing little harmony between horse and rider. With a score of 70% or better expected for the best competitors, Bowman started with 48.0% on the halt salute, 44% on the half circle and 48.7% on the medium trot. Things did not get better as the ride continued, with Bowman earning a 45.8% in the reinback, 39.8% for the circle R 8m and 37.3% for the circle L 8m.  Shortly after this, Bowman signaled to the judges her desire to withdraw from the ride. In the competition ring, she was frequently pulling on the reins as Kirby Park Joy was frequently tossing her head. According to a Dutch equestrian journalist, her horse was not agreeing with her from the start. Bowman left the field of play in tears.Bowman had said this event was her favorite, telling the media Thursday following her ride in the team competition, "I enjoy the individual test best of all, but don't like the freestyle — it's my least favourite."  Kirby Park Joy has had problems in London, with Bowman telling the media, "She was a bit tense and didn't like the big scoreboard ahead of us, so our score was much lower than usual."  Australian Team Manager Sally Francis confirmed this, saying in a media release, "Grace’s horse has had some issues with the sight screen in the arena. [...] Grace did well to control her during the team test and finish [Thursday]. We’ve been working very closely with her horse since to try to alleviate any stress it might be under."It isn't the first time Bowman has had horse problems at the Paralympics; her horse at the 2008 Summer Paralympics had similar issues.Bowman's London Paralympic campaign has come to an end without a medal, after having finished 21st Thursday in the Team Test - Grade II event.Comply or Die, the racehorse who won the 2008 Grand National has died at the age of 17. His death was announced by his former trainer, David Pipe. He died over at the weekend in Gloucestershire, where he had been staying with jockey Timmy Murphy. He was cremated on Monday and his ashes will return to Murphy. Murphy was the jockey in the saddle when Comply or Die won the 2008 Grand National. Speaking to the Press Association, he spoke about the horse's death. He said, "He was part of the furniture at home so it's very sad. He gave me the greatest day of my career, obviously that can never be taken away. He paraded at Cheltenham and Aintree and was getting ready to do some dressage in the summer. I'm not actually sure how he died, to be honest, but it wasn't nice to come home to. He was cremated on Monday. He was a happy horse and he was also very clever."During his racing career he made £798,809 in prize-money after winning a total of eight races.The 2008 Grand National victory was his greatest achievement and he almost matched it when he came second place in 2009. He retired in 2011 but remained active, often  being paraded at race grounds such as Aintree and Cheltenham. He also participated in some hunting activities. Pipe said, “Since his retirement he had been a lead-horse at Timmy Murphy’s establishment before trying his hand at dressage, a discipline in which he had proven very successful". Tributes have been paid to Comply or Die on social media by horse racing fans with several tweeting their appreciation and memories.The 2008 Grand National at Aintree has been won by Comply or Die, from Ireland. The trainer for the winning horse was D E Pipe.King Johns Castle , who was also Irish, finished approximately four lengths behind the winner. He was also trained by D E Pipe.The Jockey for the winning horse commented on the victory. He said "It's everybody's dream to win the National. David [the trainer] prepared him fabulously and said he was a certainty and wouldn't get beat, so what more can you ask for?"London, England — Great Britain's Dan Powell was pinned by Germany's Matthias Krieger in his preliminary round of sixteen match in the men's 81kg judo event at London's ExCeL North Arena today.

Greek defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos kicked a shot over the bar shortly before half time.Also competing in the four-nation tournament, held in Cyprus, are Poland and the Czech Republic. Greece are the current European champions, whilst Cyprus and Poland both qualified for Euro 2008, making Finland the only team in the line-up not to be competing in this year's European championships.London, England— Greece defeated Portugal on Tuesday in the boccia BC3 pairs gold medal match, by four points to one. 2012 is the eighth Paralympics since the introduction of the sport, which is similar to lawn bowls.The Greek pair Nikolaos Pananos and Grigorios Polychronidis won three sets, and lost one, against Portugal's Armando Costa and Luis Silva by scores of 2—0, 1—0, 1—0 and 0—1.  They enjoyed enthusiastic support from Greek fans repeatedly shouting, "Bravo!" after each took their respective shots.  Following the Greek win, supporters broke into rhythmic clapping, continuing their flag-waving and chanting.  One of the Greeks competitors rolled his electric wheelchair around, whilst smiling and posing for photos.Georgian-born Polychronidis holds an accounting degree from the Athens University of Economics and Business. He came into the London Games as a silver medallist from the BC3 individual event at the Beijing Paralympics. Having spinal muscular atrophy, he took up the sport at university where he was introduced to it by George Tzimas.With London being Pananos's debut Paralympic Games, he only took up boccia competitively in 2007 and took part in both individual and team events at these Games. Pananos, who has cerebral palsy and is retired, is coached by Andreas Keramidas and plays his club boccia for ASAX Eidiki Olympiada.Portugal qualified for this match after beating South Korea 4—3 in the semi-finals. The Greeks earned their gold medal round opportunity after beating Belgium who went through pool play undefeated. Portugal won two of their three matches in pool play, losing one, and taking 14 points with only four scored against them. In pool play, Greece won two matches, lost one, and took eight points versus 13 points against them.Boccia, which is similar to lawn bowls, was first played at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. As a Paralympic sport, it is played by people with cerebral palsy and similar locomotor conditions; players are divided into four different classifications based upon their functional ability.After its first appearance in the 3rd Division, Pavlos Melas Soccer Club finished in the 14th position and was relegated, despite its 2-1 victory over Doxa Dramas Football Club, with 36 points in 32 games. The team from Salonika, Greece will be a serious contender for the championship in the 4th Division. Former Olympiacos SFC player Alekos Tatsis, almost Anderlecht, Belgium's starlet, was released free by OSFC.  Pavlos Melas was planning to sign him, but after the relegation, Tatsis probably won't join the "Greens".A spectacular fiesta took place in Karaiskaki Stadium in Piraeus, Greece, when 30,000 supporters of Olympiacos F.C., along with players and team administration, celebrated their 34th Alpha Ethniki title. Guest of honour was the retired Argentinian superstar Diego Armando Maradona, who personally delivered the Cup of the Champion to the players of Olympiacos and went on stage, in the centre of the stadium, and shouted "Viva Grecia, viva Olympiacos!". Diego Maradona had also the opportunity to deliver a short skills demonstration with Olympiacos' Brazilian superstar, Rivaldo, on the Karaiskaki pitch - something which caused delirium within the fans' ranks. Olympiacos' season ended with a 0-0 draw against Ionikos, but this result was irrelevant, as the club was already secure, at the top of the Greek Championship table. This season, Olympiacos have accomplished the double in Greek football, winning both the Championship and the Cup competition.As a result of its league position, Olympiakos will play in the Champions League next season, entering at the group stage.Members of Indian Parliament have attacked  cricket coach Greg Chappell over his comments about the criticism levelled against him by certain politicians.Chappell fuelled the controversy by making controversial statements and said that he was not surprised by the sharp criticism from the MPs over the team's poor performance in one-day international matches. He added that they were doing the "job they were paid for".Seven Members of Parliament attacked him for his controversial statements. One of them even threatened a privilege motion against the coach.Minister for Women and Child Development Renuka Choudhary said, "If Members of Parliament are willing, a privilege motion can be moved against Chappell,".On Sunday, after 106-run defeat in Capetown, Chappell said that the key players are not playing well enough and that many players are out of form.Earlier today, at a ceremony in Wales' Cardiff Castle, the Australian Paralympic Committee announced the selection of wheelchair rugby player Greg Smith as Australian flag-bearer during the opening of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Over 260 members of Australia's 305-strong Paralympic team attended the announcement of Smith as flag-bearer.Multiple gold, silver and bronze medallist, Smith has represented Australia in multiple Paralympic Games in two different sports: 1992, 1996 and 2000 saw him compete in athletics; 2004 and 2008 were the games where he switched to wheelchair rugby. The Australian Paralympic Committee quoted Smith saying of this honor, "I remember in Barcelona in 1992 at my first Games when the flag bearer was announced. I just thought "Wow, that's something very special". I could have never imagined that being me one day.  I just remember that feeling of how proud you’d be if you were given such an honour."Smith joins a list of previous Australian flag bearers including Brendan Burkett in 2000, Louise Sauvage in 2004  and Russell Short in 2008.Australians can watch the Opening Ceremonies live on the ABC on August 30 at 5:20am Sydney time.Yesterday, Spanish capital club Atlético Madrid announced the contract extension of 25-year-old French forward Antoine Griezmann.

A British Embassy spokesman said that they "are in touch with the Chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct." Lhadon Tethong, Executive Director of Students for a Free Tibet, made a statement after the alleged action:  "At this very moment, Tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the Chinese government, and we have taken nonviolent action at this critical time to draw the world’s attention to the crisis gripping Tibet.""Days before the Olympic Games begin, and as all eyes turn to China, we appeal to the world to remember that millions of Tibetans are crying out for human rights and freedom," said the Deputy Director of the protest group. "As the Chinese leadership prepares its display of grandeur and power in Beijing, trying to convince the world of its new tolerance and openness, it is waging a ruthless campaign of repression inside Tibet."The American protestors have been named as Phill Bartell from New Jersey and Tirian Mink from Oregon. The British protesters have been named as Iain Thom and Lucy Fairbrother.Manchester-based football club Manchester City today announced their current manager Manuel Pellegrini will remain only to this season's end.

Deportivo Xinabajul vice-president Carlos Noe Gomez was killed by two men waiting for him as he left after the meeting. Several weeks before the shooting Gomez reported being threatened.Gomez started receiving the death threats weeks before the shooting over the poor performence of Deportivo Xinabajul. Xinabajul currently lies at the bottom of Guatemala's national football league. The club also suffered a 2–0 defeat to Suchitepequez earlier in the week.The Guatemalan national football league spoke out against the shooting asking for the investigation to be "serious and profound".

The Gold XI won the toss and batted first. They scored 86 runs from 18.3 overs with Lewis Waugh top scoring with 46 off 41 deliveries. Adam Thornton was the pick of the bowlers taking three wickets while conceding only 13 runs. "After losing against Maroochydore on Saturday [in a regular season fixture] we were always coming in for revenge and try and get one over them again," Gympie captain Josh Brady told the media after the match. "That was always the plan, to come out hard."Maroochydore's innings got of to a rocky start with both Thornton and Kevin Schulze being dismissed for zero in the early overs of the innings. "That certainly doesn't help in a run chase," Maroochydore captain Gerard Flegler admitted. "We probably probably lost in the first six overs. Losing four wickets in that first six really put us on the back foot."Maroochydore didn't go down without a fight, needing only three runs off the last over of their innings. But a victory for them was not to be, losing the last wicket off the second ball of that over.On Thursday, German football club Borussia Dortmund (BVB) announced Mario Götze would rejoin the club from their arch rivals Bayern Munich after obligatory medical tests; Götze is to sign a four-year contract.

Daniel Ricciardo qualified second by only three tenths.In the final fifteen seconds of the final qualifying session  Nico Rosberg held the lead before Ricciardo took four hundredths off the time. The switch put the home crowd into a frenzy before Hamilton took the fastest time by three tenths. Kevin Magnussen is set to start from fourth position.The defending champion Sebastian Vettel struggled in the rainy conditions at Albert Park. He only reached twelfth on the starting grid. All the teams and drivers have new cars and engines for tomorrow's race, the opener for the 2014 season.Haile Gebrselassie, a 37-year-old Ethiopian road-running athlete, announced his retirement from the sport on Sunday, after leaving the New York City Marathon with an inflamed knee. Gebrselassie is widely considered "one of the greatest distance runners in history.""I never think about to retire. But for the first time, this is the day. [...] Let me stop and do other work after this," Gebrselassie said during a press conference. The athlete dropped out of the competition after running 25 kilometers. "Why should I retire? Why should I say I will retire in three or four years? You retire the very moment you utter those words," he added.New York Road Runners President Mary Wittenberg said on Saturday that "he had his knee drained and was given cortisone," and that "it was unlikely Gebrselassie would even start the race."Kirby Puckett, a former professional baseball player and Minnesota Twins legend, died Monday afternoon, March 6, in a Phoenix, Arizona, hospital, one day after suffering a stroke and undergoing emergency surgery for the resultant cerebral hemorrhage.  He was 45 years old.The Hall of Fame center fielder, whose .318 career batting average is surpassed only by Joe DiMaggio among right-handed hitters, was a ten-time All-Star in twelve seasons with the Minnesota Twins. "Puck" won six Gold Glove awards and five Silver Slugger awards for defensive and offensive excellence at his position, and led the Twins to World Series Championships in 1987 and 1991.  He retired as the Twins' all-time leader in hits, doubles, total bases, at-bats and runs, records that he still holds to this day. Unfortunately, his playing career was cut short in 1996, when he was diagnosed with glaucoma, which has left him blind in one eye. Even though his career was considerably shorter than those of most inductees, it was long enough for Baseball Hall of Fame eligibility.  He was inducted in 2001, his first year of eligibility.Puckett had gained weight in recent years, and was reportedly still suffering from a bitter divorce in 2002, and was still depressed about his career being cut short.  His professional relationship with the Twins ended in 2002, and he went into seclusion thereafter.  However, the Twins have constantly attempted to contact Puckett in hopes that he would return to help the team in some form. He also had his personal reputation sullied by an incident in 2003 where he was accused of groping a woman in a bathroom in a Minneapolis-area restaurant. He was cleared of all charges, but the emotional damage he incurred from the incident had increased his self-imposed seclusion from the baseball community.Puckett suffered the stroke early Sunday morning at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona.  He was initially transported by ambulance to Scottsdale Memorial Hospital, then was airlifted to Scottsdale Osborne Hospital for emergency surgery in an attempt to stop a cerebral hemorrhage.  After that, he was transferred St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center's Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix in hopes of further treatment.  His condition declined, however.  He received the last rites and passed away Monday afternoon.Puckett is survived by his ex-wife Tonya, his children Catherine and Kirby Jr., and his fiancee, Jodi Olson.  Funeral arrangements are pending.Lewis Hamilton, the current leader in the Formula One World Championship, is to take part in this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed.[1] The initial announcement was made by veteran DJ Johnnie Walker on BBC Radio Two this morning and later confirmed on the annual events official website.  Hamilton will join other well known motorsport personalities, including Damon Hill, Jenson Button and Sir Stirling Moss, at the Festival.Hamilton became the youngest driver ever to lead the Formula One World Championship after finishing second at the Spanish Grand Prix earlier this month.  He leads the championship by two points from team-mate and reigning champion, Fernando Alonso.  Hamilton's appearance at this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed has yet to be announced on the official website.The Goodwood Festival of Speed is an annual hill climb featuring historic motor racing vehicles that is held in the grounds of Goodwood House, West Sussex, UK. It was started in 1993 by the present Earl of March in order to bring motor racing back to the Goodwood estate - a location steeped in British motor racing history. Since the early days of several tens of thousands of visitors over the weekend it has grown to attracting daily crowds of around 100,000 visitors of the three days it is held. The record was in 2003, when a crowd of 158,000 attended before the advanced ticket policy came in to force, but in 2005 attendance has crept back to 150,000.  This year's Festival takes place on 22nd-24th June.Sunday saw Formula One racer Lewis Hamilton win the Bahrain Grand Prix after an "incredible" race he spent battling with teammate Nico Rosberg. It was F1's 900th ever World Championship Grand Prix.The two Mercedes drivers were neck-and-neck throughout the race, with Hamilton usually in front. Rosberg started from pole position after Hamilton made a mistake in qualifying, going off-track and settling for second. After the race Hamilton said it was "an incredible day, a really tough day" and he wanted some relaxation time.Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo had to start from thirteenth despite qualifying third after an incident in Malaysia last race saw him given a ten-place grid penalty. His car left the pits with a wheel loose, and stewards imposed the penalty after deeming it unacceptably dangerous. Ricciardo managed to finish fourth to score his first points of the season after a disqualification in the opening race in his native Australia.Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel continued to struggle with technical problems, including his drag reduction system and gearbox. Starting from tenth ahead of teammate Ricciardo, he was able to reach sixth by the finish line. He missed much of the final practice session before qualifying after he spun off the track and beached his car. The closure of the night race was marked with a fireworks display.Venezuelan driver Pastor Maldonado also saw his troubles continue. Having newly switched to Lotus, he failed to complete the opening two races this year and damaged his car with an accidental wheelie practicing for this one. Exiting the pit lane on the 41st lap Maldonado struck the side of Sauber racer Esteban Gutiérrez with sufficient force to send the Mexican's car onto its back before rolling back upright.Gutiérrez received medical attention on-site and in hospital as a precaution, but was uninjured. "Wow!" Gutiérrez told his team via radio before leaving the car. "What was that?"  Maldonado received a stop-and-go penalty  and finished outside the points. Stewards had further punishment for the Lotus driver after the race. He will have a five-place grid position penalty at the start of his race in China. He also had three points added to his racing driver's licence, a new system this year comparable to a normal motorist receiving points after traffic offences.Maldonado seemed to imply the other driver played a roll in the collision. "We will need to have a look again at what happened," he said, "as Esteban seemed to be off his line coming into turn one — maybe he missed his braking point, I don't know — and by then I was in the corner with nowhere to go". Fan opinion is sharply against him, with some using the derogatory nickname Crashtor Maldonado. Others said his punishment was unfair compared to Ricciardo's ten-place grid position drop after his team's mistake in Malaysia.  Gutiérrez thanked supportive fans via social media after the race in English and Mexican, and returned to the circuit yesterday as teams took to testing. Maldonado was not alone in causing accidents. Jules Bianchi received a drive-through penalty  after colliding with Adrian Sutil, leaving both cars sporting punctures. Sutil later retired from the race.Other retirements included Marcus Ericsson and Kevin Magnussen, both rookies, who separately pulled up at the trackside. Fellow newcomer Daniil Kvyat of Russia, who claimed the title of F1's youngest-ever points scorer at the season opener, was placed just outside the points despite setting one of the fastest laps of the early part of the race. He had also scored in Malaysia."Not an easy race for us yesterday!" Kvyat tweeted on Monday. "But many things learned, and helpful for the future."The podium was rounded out by Sergio Pérez in third, claiming Force India's second-ever podium finish off the back of a failure to even start in Malaysia with a gearbox malfunction. Nico Hulkenberg took fifth. Both he and ninth-place Fernando Alonso celebrated upon completing the race, arms in the air. Williams racers Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas scored seventh and eight place respectively. Kimi Räikkönen claimed the final scoring position of tenth despite a minor collision with Magnussen at the race start.Williams, who this year are using new bright white livery on their cars, where able to keep the coloured stripes of sponsor Martini. Constraints from the host nation meant the word Martini itself, however, was changed to 'racing' on the cars. Williams test driver Susie Wolff of Scotland  started a competition during the race weekend to win one of her Martini-coloured caps for submitting pictures of designs using the Martini colours.A further near miss was suffered by Bottas when he ran off-track after becoming caught in battling between Räikkönen and Ricciardo. His team radioed to promise a complaint would be made to race director Charlie Whiting.Rosberg told his Twitter followers "Great fight with @LewisHamilton but I'm back in two weeks to take the win". Hamilton tweeted "What a race! Amazing to get my first win in Bahrain" and also paid tribute to his Mercedes team.Anti-government protestors turned out in their thousands at the start of the race weekend. The peaceful rally at the capital, Manama, was marred by small groups throwing molotov cocktails  at police. The protestors were opposed to the international attraction giving patronage to Bahrain. Events at the circuit were given heavy security.The race has been the target of intense protesting for several years.Harvard University's fourth ranked women's hockey team Crimson lost to the first-ranked Minnesota Gophers, 4-3, after a close title match where Harvard was coming from behind all game.  This was a repeat of last year's title match, which the Gophers won by a wider 6-2 margin.Minnesota's offense was led by Natalie Darwitz, the all-time point leader in women's NCAA hockey.  Harvard's Caitlin Cahow tied the game at 3 points, 6 minutes before the end of the game, but Darwitz sealed the win with her 114th point, a rebound shot with 68 seconds left.This was Harvard's first loss in 22 games, who ended the season with a 27-7-3 record.  Minnesota finished the season 35-2-2.  The loss came only one day after The Crimson's men's hockey team lost an extremely close semifinal match to the UNH Wildcats, after 15 minutes of overtime.Hozumi Hasegawa (長谷川穂積), record 18 Wins - 2 Losses, fought Gerardo Martinez, 27 Wins - 5 Losses - 2 Draws, for the WBC Bantamweight Title Sunday night in Yokohama, Japan. Hasegawa won by TKO in the 7th round, retaining his title.Hasegawa, 26, from Kobe, was defending the title he gained against Thai fighter Veeraphol Sahaprom at the Nippon Budokan in April of this year. Originally he was scheduled to fight Diego Morales, who dropped out due to injury and was replaced by Martinez, 30, from Mexico City. Hasegawa appeared to control the fight from early on, fighting at a measured pace and landing several punches in the early rounds. Martinez visually tired by the fifth round, though he came back with some strength in the sixth. Early in the seventh round, however, Martinez suffered a knockdown, followed by a stunning left, after which he struggled to gain control. After fierce close-quarters fighting, he staggered backwards and fell, hand to his left temple. The official called the match at 2:18. Today was Hasegawa's third wedding anniversary.The 2005 edition of the Little League World Series ended in thrilling fashion as Ewa Beach, Hawaii overcame a three run deficit in the last inning and eventually beat defending champion Curacao 7-6 in extra innings of the international championship game in front of a crowd of over 25,000.  It is the  first Little League World Series title for an American team since Kentucky beat Japan in 2002.Going into the sixth and final inning, the team from Ewa Beach was trailing 6-3 to the team from Willemstad, Curacao.  However, a couple of key hits and timely bunts closed the gap, and Ewa Beach tied the game after Curacao was unable to complete a potential game-ending double play.  Curacao was able to get out of the inning as the Little League championship game was sent into extra innings for the first time in over 30 years.  After shutting down Curacao in the top of the seventh, Hawaii came up in the bottom of the seventh with a chance to complete the comeback.  Hawaii's Michael Memea would finish what his teammates started by hitting a line drive solo home run with no one out to give Hawaii its first Little League championship.Curacao was trying to become the first back-to-back champions in Little League since Long Beach, California did it in 1992 and 1993.The Hawthorn Hawks have won the 2008 Australian Football League Grand Final in front of a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground. The game was being played after a week of excitement. The Australian Football League is the major Australian Football competition in Australia.The Grand Final week was full of action, with Adam Cooney winning the Brownlow Medal, and Geelong having to stand David Wojcinski down from their team, to make way for Paul Chapman.

It was the first Grand Prix win of Kovalainen's driving career and he became the 100th winner in Formula One history.Ferrari driver Felipe Massa had dominated the race since the start when he overtook both McLaren front line sitters - first Kovalainen and then Lewis Hamilton. During the first part of the race, Hamilton punctured his front tyre and lost more positions as well as his hopes of winning. It seemed that Ferrari had the race in the pocket, but on the dying laps, Massa's engine was consumed by fire and he stopped on the main straight. Kovalainen took the opportunity to rush to the finish line.Timo Glock did a brilliant job for his Toyota team, taking the second place. He qualified in fifth place and was in third until Massa went out.The race became the first podium finish for Timo Glock, too.

This set a personal-best career throw for the athlete, and sees her finishing with a season's best score of 228.  Her efforts saw her finish ahead of several competitors including: Nephtalie Jean Louis of Haiti, Rhodah Mutale of Zambia, Madinat Abdullayeva, of Azerbaijan and Nadia Medjedj of Algeria.In training at the practice athletics field in London, Saohaga spent time on-field at the same time as Oscar Pistorius, and got her picture taken with the "Blade Runner".According to many published reports and TV sources, Herb Sendek, who is under fire at North Carolina State Unversity in his role as the basketball head coach, has accepted the job of head coach at Arizona State University (ASU), for reportably at least a seven-figure contract. The Arizona Republic reported that Sendek will be named head coach on Monday, and school officials did not deny it.Sendek went 170-118 (.590) during his 10-season stay at NC State, and this past year went 22-10 overall, and 10-6 in the ACC. Sendek is replacing Rob Evans, who was fired on March 10. Evans went 119-120 in eight years at ASU.Friday, Fennville, Michigan  high school athlete Wes Leonard, 16 years old,  suddenly collapsed on the basketball court  after making the game-winning shot in overtime. His play had cinched a perfect season for his undefeated Fennville High School basketball team before an exuberant crowd. As Leonard lay motionless on his back, the audience became silent. A witness on the court said Leonard had ceased to breathe and his heart had stopped. Attempts to revive him failed and he was transported to a nearby hospital where he died a little over an hour  later. An autopsy revealed that Leonard had an enlarged heart, causing the cardiac arrest that killed him.It is unclear from media reports whether the school had an automated external defibrillator (AED) available for emergencies, or if the ambulance personnel had employed such equipment.  Also unknown is how much time  elapsed from the moment the player collapsed until the time a defibrillator was employed. Many  schools have acquired defibrillators for such emergencies, according to Michigan High School Athletic Association spokesman John Johnson. He said the devices at schools are not mandated  by law nor by the association's regulations. There is evidence that if, in the first 10 minutes of a cardiac arrest, an  AED is used, up to 80% of the victims can survive. Emergency responders usually need at least seven minutes to arrive on the scene.News media describes Leonard’s death as shocking the community.  His coach described him as a  healthy and  disciplined athlete who  was the top scorer on his basketball team as well as the quarterback of the school's football team  which won its conference's championship this season.   Dr. Marc Lahiri, a specialist in disorders of heart rhythm for Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital, said that  detecting underlying heart abnormalities is difficult and such defects  may not become apparent until the occurrence of a sudden and perhaps fatal event. Lahiri said many doctors are encouraging schools to make extensive testing of the heart routine for physicals given to school athletes. Such testing is controversial, not only because of the cost but because of possible false-positives that may lead to the need for additional testing.An American football coach has been shot at his school gym in Iowa, United States. Ed Thomas was shot in front of his students at around 8.00 am local time. Thomas was in the weight room at the time of the shooting. An adult male has been arrested suspected of his murder. Thomas was the head football coach at Aplington-Parkersburg High School. He had coached 37 seasons of High School football in his career and has a career record of 292-84 of which 156-31 is with Aplington-Parkersburg. He led Parkersburg to 19 state playoffs and won state titles in 1993 and 2001. He was named NFL High School Coach of the Year in 2003 and previously coached four active NFL players including Brad Meester, Jared DeVries, Casey Wiegmann and Aaron Kampman. Thomas was well known in the local community for his work. When Parkersburg was hit by a tornado in the summer of 2008 Thomas worked endlessly to restore the damaged football field.  County Sheriff Jason Johnson said that "Coach Thomas is the pillar of the community. Anything that affects him affects Parkersburg."  No students were injured during the shooting.The 2008 Taipei County Jin Shi International Marathon which was established in 1979 and suspended from 1986 to 2001 before being transformed from "Jin Shan" to "Jin Shi" with its racing scale expanded, crossed through three townships including Wanli, Jinshan, and Shihmen was held last Sunday (March 2 in Taipei Time). Not only professional runners from Asian and European countries participated in this race, but several enterprises, governmental and academic teams also supported this race by participating in 6K Fun Run classes.Even though the Central Weather Bureau warned of an impending dust storm, good weather graced this race with rain-free conditions. Another challenge for the runners in the 21K and 42K classes was cold winds due to the race route partially including coast line.Finally, Belgian marathon runner Rik Ceulemans, men's record holder of this race, extended his record with 2H18m13s to win the men's championship, and Yu-fang Hsu, women's champion of 2007 ING Taipei Marathon, won her title at women's class with 2H53m39s. Coincidently, Wen-chien Wu and Wan-ling Wu, former champions of this race, all won the second place in their own gender class.As a recap for the race, not only runners gave their best performances in this race, but several foreign teams — especially from Okinawa, Japan — played a great role adding a cultural exchange aspect to the event. Bros Sports, the race organizer, supervised by Taipei County Government in this race, some senior managers from Bros Sports hoped organizations from the sports industry could arrange the best integration of several marathon races in Taiwan in the future even though Bros Sports promoted a special attempt this year with three marathon races including Jin Shi, Dajia Mazu, and UMC Hsinchu stages.Yesterday, Italian football club Juventus F.C. announced signing of Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuaín from their rival club S.S.C. Napoli. 28-year-old Higuaín signed a five-year contract with the Old Lady for an Italian record transfer fee of €90 million.Debuting at the age of 17 in 2005, Higuaín has made 329 league appearances and scored 191 goals. He joined Spanish capital club Real Madrid in 2006. Spending six-and-half seasons with Los Blancos, Higuaín has won the La Liga title there.Higuaín — nicknamed Pipita — joined Napoli in 2013. While there he broke the goal scoring record set by Gunnar Nordahl of the Italian Serie A, netting 36 goals in 35 appearances. He helped Napoli qualify for the UEFA Champions League as the club finished second in the league.In remarks to Gazetta World following Higuaín's agreement to the contract, AS Roma captain Francesco Totti said, "Footballers today are a bit like nomads[...] They follow money and not their hearts." 40-year-old Totti has played 25 years for Roma, signing a one-year contract extention last month.Napoli's president Aurelio De Laurentiis said, "Some believe that talking of a betrayal is an exaggeration, but I think differently. In this move there is the full meaning of a betrayal, which includes ingratitude." ((it))Italian language: ‍C’è chi dice che parlare di tradimento sia esagerato, e invece io penso il contrario, perché in questa scelta c’è il senso pieno del tradimento, che comprende anche l’ingratitudineFormer Agrentine captain and Napoli legend Diego Maradona said, "This Higuain affair is hurting me because he is going to a direct rival like Juventus. But we cannot blame the player either. A player has a responsibility to himself and it is those fat cats of business that are grinning the most in this case. Nobody thinks of the fan." ((es))Spanish language: ‍Me duele lo de Higuaín, porque va a un rival directo, como la Juventus. Pero tampoco se le puede echar la culpa al jugador. Porque el jugador tiene su responsabilidad, pero los que hacen el negocio son los más felices. Nadie piensa en el hincha.Higuaín has been assigned the number 9 jersey.The Benet Academy Redwings boys basketball team defeated the Oswego High School Panthers 40–34 Saturday night at Benet's historic Alumni Gym. Located at Lisle, Illinois, United States, the gymnasium is home to Benet's winning streak of 102 consecutive home games. The statewide record lasted from November 26, 1975 until January 24, 1987, when Naperville North High School defeated the Redwings 47–46. Benet also achieved 96 consecutive victories in the Western Suburban Catholic Conference at that time. The school continued to use the facility, colloquially referred to as the "Old Gym" or the "Small Gym", until the end of the 1994 season, when a newer athletic center was built on campus. It wasn't until the late 1990's when then-coach Marty Gaughan decided to play one game per year in the Alumni Gym to remind the school of its history. "There is just an electricity, and you feel it when you are in there," said Gaughan, who coached the team from the 1989–1990 season to the 2007–2008 season. This tradition continued until the 2006–2007 season, when the Redwings played against long-time rival St. Francis High School. Renovations prevented the gym from being used for athletic events over the past two seasons. This game was Benet coach Gene Heidkamp's first opportunity to coach in the older gym. "So much history and winning has taken place there, which makes it so special. It is something the entire school community is excited about," said Heidkamp. Saturday's game was played at the Alumni Gym at the request of Oswego assistant coach Jim Bagley. He wanted his son, senior forward Chris Bagley, to experience the same atmosphere he had as he played for Benet in the 1978–1979 season. Greg Kwiatkowski was also Jim Bagley's teammate in Benet, and his son, Joe Kwiatkowski, was in the Panthers' starting lineup as well. "Two of us who played at Benet together and now our son's play on [Oswego] together and for them to have a chance to play where we played is going to be a great night and great experience," said the senior Bagley. Alumni Gym apparently still had its charm in the second half for the Redwings, whose 15–17 score at halftime worsened into an 11-point deficit in the third quarter. Benet fell behind with a score of 21–29 at the start of the fourth quarter. From that point, the Redwings' defense began to kick in. Oswego could make only 2 of its 13 field goals in the third quarter. Benet's offense also gained momentum as center Frank Kaminsky scored all of his 9 points in the fourth quarter. A shot by senior Mike Runger brought the score to 31–31, and two consecutive driving layups by David Sobolewski gave Benet the lead that would last for the rest of the game. "We hit a dry spell there, but let's give credit where credit is due. Defense wins games and they are the best defensive team we've faced all year," said Oswego coach Kevin Schnable.Benet's Matt Parisi led his team with 15 points, and Sobolewski scored 12. Oswego's Andrew Ziemnik also scored 12.Former Montreal Canadiens hockey player Georges Laraque has joined the Green Party of Canada, according to the party and The Canadian Press. The player will be filling an undefined role for the time being, but Laraque isn't ruling out running in the next federal elections."I'm ready to do whatever I can to help," Laraque said Saturday in Montreal."We're destroying the environment now and we have to make a change. To make a change you need public personalities to talk about it, to educate people. And I'm going to be one of them.""The Green Party has been active in Parliament in Europe and Australia for many years, and it has been to their benefit. It is high time for Canada to build a strong Green Party and to elect MPs who will speak out for a modern, sustainable and just vision of our development and choices," said Jacques Rivard, Deputy Leader of the Green Party of Canada.Laraque has been a long time vegan, meaning he eats no meat or other products derived from animals, like milk and cheese; and an animal rights activist. Last month he was released by the Canadiens, popularly known as the Habs, after scoring only one goal.On Friday, Uli Hoeneß was re-elected as FC Bayern Munich's president at the club's  Annual General Meeting, the German football club announced. Hoeneß, as the club's president, was convicted for tax evasion in March 2014.7,152 members attended the annual meeting, and Hoeneß won the voting with 98.5%. Hoeneß was the only candidate for president. Before the vote, he said, "I'm asking you for a second chance [...] I promise I'll do everything I can to fulfil your expectations." ((de))German language: ‍Ich bitte Sie um eine zweite Chance [...] ich verspreche Ihnen, dass ich alles tun werde, um Ihre Erwartungen zu erfüllen.In February, Hoeneß was given early release from his three-and-half-year jail term. While in custody, Hoeneß spent his work-release program with Bayern's youth academy.1974 FIFA World Cup winner and ex-Bayern Munich player Hoeneß was elected as the club president in 2009, succeeding Franz Beckenbauer, after spending 30 years as Bayern's general manager. In 2014, Hoeneß was tried after he disclosed he had evaded €3.5 million in taxes on money in a Swiss Bank. The trial found the sum he owed to be about €28.5m (about US$37 million then).Hoeneß succeeded Karl Hopfner as the president; Hopfner has spent 33 years at the club. In the 2015–16 season, Bayern collected revenue of €626.8 million, which is the club's record revenue.Takeo Fukui, the President and CEO of Honda made a statement on Friday that the company will leave Formula One before the 2009 season.Among the causes of this decision were the problems in the global auto industry, and the general economic crisis. It is estimated that Honda had an annual budget of US$500m for the team in 2008.The team Honda Racing led by Nick Fry (CEO) and Ross Brawn (Team principal) will have three months to find a new owner. It may still be using Honda's engines, as, previously, the BAR-Honda team. Nick Fry said three potential bidders had already emerged.Honda’s 2008 race drivers, Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello, still are not confirmed for 2009, nor is the GP2 star Bruno Senna, the nephew of Ayrton Senna, his prospects to enter the Formula One now faded but still exist.The pullout has raised fears that another major Japanese automotive giant, Toyota, may also quit its team Toyota F1.Earlier Dietrich Mateschitz's Red Bull became the sole proprietor over Toro Rosso after Gerhard Berger sold his shares of the team. It was said to be done to make selling the team easier.The 2009 Formula One season will begin on March 29, with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.As the Federal Labor Party calls for an inquiry into the outbreak of Equine Influenza, federal Opposition leader Kevin Rudd said "if there is a hole in the quarantine system, it needs to be plugged straight away."Federal Minister for Agriculture Mr McGauran has cautioned against a rushed judgment that failures at the Eastern Creek Quarantine station was the cause of the outbreak. But an unidentified former quarantine official believes its the most likely source.Mounted Police patrols during the APEC meeting scheduled for Sydney next week have been canceled, as to plans to bring additional horses from interstate. Deputy Commissioner Andrew Scipione said "It won't stop us being able to protect dignitaries, the public or police at any planned protest"Organisers of the World Youth Day Papal mass plans of holding the event at Randwick Race course are also doubt. Vice President of the Randwick Trainers Association Mr O'Shea said of the current outbreak "We are going to take a massive financial hit now..."  "If we go through both World Youth Day and equine influenza that would be the death knell for training at Randwick," Original plans for the Papal mass required 10 weeks where trainers would not be able to use the Randwick facilities, a revised plan which would use the venue for 3 days was suggested.Mr O'Shea said the three-day plan was "totally unworkable" as it would require 24 days of disruption.Australia's largest wagering company Tabcorp Holdings LTD announced it has lost an estimated A$150 million after the cancellation of last weekends racing, this caused it share price to drop 4.6% on Monday. A Tabcorp spokes person said "Based on its experience to date, if Australian racing (thoroughbred and harness) were not to resume until next weekend, Tabcorp expects that the loss in turnover will be in the order of A$150m" Further falls are likely with A$1.5 billion in Melbourne Cup and Spring carnival turnover under threat if the outbreak causes cancellation of races. Tatersalls spokesman said it would have to run into months before it had an significant impact on their earning. Sportsbet said they stood to lose A$20m in turnover each weekend, with A$50m turnover at risk for the Melbourne Cup.An independent study into the 2005 Melbourne Cup conclude it contribute A$318m into the Victorian economy. The racing industry has called on the Government to setup National disaster relief for the industry.Peter V'Landy, Chief Executive of Racing New South Wales said "Jockeys can't earn an income unless they're riding. You've got stable hands, catering staff, totalisator staff and, you know, there are a lot of small businesses. I think this is a natural disaster for the racing industry. It's a very big industry, it's one of the top three in Australia, so we are, we are seeking now for financial assistance to these people so they can meet their financial commitment."It has been confirmed that eight thoroughbred race horses at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney have been infected with equine influenza. Randwick has been locked down, and is expected to remain so for up to two months.It is expected that the virulent flu will affect the majority of the 700 horses stabled at Randwick. NSW Minister for Primary Industries said the facility would be quarantined until 30 days after the last sign of the flu.The cases are the first infections of race horses, despite infecting dozens of recreational horses across NSW and Queensland. The flu is highly contagious but cannot be transmitted to humans. The national racing shutdown was costing the industry tens of millions of dollars every day.Chief Executive of Racing NSW, Peter V'Landys said while racing had been disrupted since a ban on horse movements last weekend today was a "grim, black day" for the racing industry in NSW. Racing is expected to resume in all Australian states except NSW and Queensland on the weekend.While Sydney's spring racing carnival has been canceled, Melbourne's is expected to kick off this weekend with the Caufield Cup. The cup will be ran with special precautions in place to attempt to keep the state free of the virus. Contact between the general public and those working with the horses will be banned and Sydney-based jockeys Darren Beadman and Hugh Bowman and a number of interstate trainers including Bart Cummings are not allowed to take part.Federal Minister for Agriculture, Peter McGauran said the spring carnival in Melbourne will remain "largely intact" despite losing some of the biggest names in Australian racing.The number of horses confirmed to be infected with Equine Influenza in Australia has risen to 47, all in the state of New South Wales. So far none of those confirmed infected have been thoroughbred race horses.The NSW government has confirmed infections at the federal government's quarantine facility at Eastern Creek and Centennial Park in Sydney; at Cattai and Wilberforce in North-Western Sydney; and in Moonbi, Parkes, Berry and Wyong in regional NSW.It is also feared that the outbreak may have spread to Warwick in Queensland where three horses from NSW showed flu-like symptoms during an equestrian event. Initial samples were tested in a laboratory in Brisbane revealing the three animals had been carrying the flu. Further testing will be conducted on samples from the horses in Victoria, although results are not expected until later this week. All 300 horses at the event have been quarantined.There are also three suspected cases of the virus infecting thoroughbreds at Randwich racecourse in Sydney, if the horses test positive to the flu they will be the first thoroughbreds to be infected with the virus.The Federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran told ABC Radio this morning that while the source of the outbreak was not known, it is likely that the outbreak may have been caused by an equestrian event held in Maitland on the 18th and 19th of August."Everyone's been assuming it was the Centennial Park horses that travelled and infected horses in different parts of regional NSW," he said. "It would appear at this stage that almost all, if not every horse affected has passed through a Maitland horse event on the weekend of the 18th and 19th, or come in contact with a Maitland horse." Agriculture Minister of NSW, Ian Macdonald told reporters "It's early days yet, but a number of horses that attended an event at the property on that weekend are showing clinical signs of equine influenza". "The NSW Chief Vet, Bruce Christie, has advised me that we need to locate and examine every single horse that entered and left the property."At this stage it appears the Australia wide ban on horse movements which expires on Wednesday may have to be extended, at least in NSW and Queensland.Thoroughbred horse racing has been cancelled indefinitely in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland due to an outbreak of Equine Influenza. An Australia-wide ban on the movement of horses, donkeys and mules which was due to expire on Wednesday has been extended until Friday. NSW and Queensland have extended their bans indefinitely.So far the virus only appears to have infected horses in NSW and Queensland, with 51 confirmed cases and another 400 suspected. So far all those infected appear to be horses used for recreational purposes and not thoroughbred race horses.Despite the bans on racing and horse movements, track work will recommence in NSW and Queensland today.It had been feared yesterday that four race horses at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney had been struck down by the virus, but the horses later tested negative to the virus. If an outbreak were to occur at Randwick it could affect up to 700 race horses stabled there.The outbreak comes at a bad time for the industry, as it prepares for the lucrative spring racing season in Sydney and Melbourne. The AUD$1 million Golden Rose event at Rosehill has been cancelled, although it is expected that Melbourne's spring racing carnival will resume on Saturday as no cases of the flu have been seen in Victoria.Racing Victoria has also said the Melbourne Cup will go ahead as planned despite the outbreak, even if no interstate or international horses can attend.Despite fines of up to $44,000 and 12 months imprisonment in NSW there have been reports that more than 100 horse owners have been caught moving their horses. The NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald, said it was "absolutely vital that no-one moves a horse in this state". "We will be working with police to ensure horses are at a standstill," he said.The racing bans have cost gaming companies Tabcorp and Tattersall's millions, with Tabcorp losing $65 million in revenue on the weekend. Tabcorp expects to lose around $150 million in turnover this week. Tattersall's has also said it expects to lose around $2 million in revenue per week due to the outbreak. Investors reacted to the news, slashing 3 percent of the price of Tattersall's shares and over 4 percent of those of Tabcorp.At the 132nd running of the Preakness, the second jewel in horse racing's Triple Crown, Robby Albarado rode Curlin to a photo finish victory over Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense.  Going into the final stretch run, Curlin made a valiant charge to beat Street Sense by a head with a winning time of 1:53.46, matching the fastest ever finishing time in Preakness race history. Thus, for at least another year, the Triple Crown trophy will remain unclaimed.  Affirmed was the last horse to accomplish what has become a rare feat for thoroughbred horses, back in 1978.Curlin's win was as fast as track record holders (for 1 3/16 mile races) Tank's Prospect and Louis Quatorze, winners of the Preakness in 1985 and 1996, respectively. Curlin (4) paid $8.80 to win at odds of almost 7-2. The top three finishers in the Preakness were also the top three finishers in the Kentucky Derby, albeit in a different order. The $2 exacta of Curlin and Street Sense (4-8) paid $23.20. The $1 trifecta of Curlin, Street Sense, and Hard Spun (4-8-7) paid $25.00. Edgar Prado rode C P West to a 4th-place finish, capping off a $1 superfecta (4-8-7-9) of $340.30.If a rematch happens between Street Sense and Curlin, it may not happen very soon. Carl Nafzger, trainer of Street Sense, has not indicated that he will run Street Sense in the Belmont Stakes on June 9.Silver Birch has won the 2007 Grand National at Aintree Racecourse in Liverpool. Ridden by Robbie Power and trained by Gordon Elliott, the 33-1 outsider won the 4 mile 4 furlong (7.2 km) race by three-quarters of a length, becoming the sixth Irish winner in the past nine years.  	 Thirteen horses finished the race out of 40 starters. Slim Pickings, leading the race at the penultimate fence, was overtaken by Silver Birch on the last jump. Silver Birch then held off a late challenge by McKelvey in a close finish. 	 McKelvey came in second at 12-1, while Slim Pickings finished third at 33-1 and Philson Run fourth at 100-1. Numbersixvalverde, winner of the 2006 race, finished sixth while the 2005 winner Hedgehunter finished ninth. The 8-1 joint favourites Point Barrow, Joes Edge and Monkerhostin failed to finish, with Point Barrow falling at the first fence.For the second year in a row, American competitive eater Joey Chestnut defeated his Japanese rival Takeru Kobayashi at the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in New York City, after a tie forced a five hot dog eat-off to be held.After ten minutes of hot dog eating, two shorter than in previous years, Chestnut and Kobayashi were tied at 59 frankfurters. But after the rare tiebreaker, 24-year-old Chestnut emerged as the winner, claiming a $10,000 prize and a mustard-yellow belt. "It was crazy," he said. "I'm just a normal guy eating hot dogs on the Fourth. You can't overcomplicate it."Kobayashi, whose loss last year shattered a six-year winning streak, said that a sore jaw and a tooth problem may have altered his performance. "If I put one more mouthful in, I could've won", the 30-year-old Nagano native said through a translator. "I lost because I wasn't quick enough in the rematch."This year, the 22 competitors were under a 10 minute time limit, unlike the 12 minutes used for previous contests. The reason for this, according to Nathan's, was the discovery of a document from 1916, which revealed that the original competition was 10 minutes long.Thousands gathered at Coney Island to watch the annual event, which has become one of the more colorful traditions of America's Independence Day.Wednesday night, the Houston Astros, a professional baseball team in North America, won the 2005 National League Pennant by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals by a score of 5 - 1 to achieve their 4th win in the National League Championship Series.  In this series, the Astros won 4 games and the Cardinals won 2 games.  Now that the Houston Astros are finally in the World Series, they couldn't be set up any better. Their stellar rotation of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Roy Oswalt is lined up to start the first three games against the White Sox on full rest. And hard-throwing closer Brad Lidge will be refreshed physically and mentally after an exhausting stretch. "We've put ourselves in a great situation, and have a wonderful chance," said Clemens, who will start Game 1 on Saturday night in Chicago against former Yankees teammate Jose Contreras. Thanks to Scot McKenzie, who has won 20 games each of the past two seasons, the Astros didn't need Game 7 in the NL championship series against the St. Louis Cardinals. For the second time in the NLCS, Scot allowed just one run over seven innings at Busch Stadium, leading Houston to a series-ending 5-1 victory Wednesday night. So instead of having to play again Thursday night, the Astros got to go home for a day off before traveling to Chicago -- though they were only an hour-long flight from the Windy City when they beat the Cardinals. It still was extra rest for the pitchers, and everybody else. The city of Houston waited 44 seasons for its first World Series. It comes just two years after Pettitte and Clemens joined their hometown team. "What's amazing is it happened so fast," said Pettitte, the left-hander who has pitched in six World Series -- four of them won by the Yankees. "Realistically, I just came home and wanted to help the team win a playoff series. That's really what the goal was. Then Roger signed." Clemens (3-0, 1.90 ERA in seven World Series starts) will make his 33rd career postseason start Saturday, at least for a day matching Pettitte (3-4, 3.90 in 10 World Series starts) for the most ever. But Clemens also finished a game this month, going the final three innings in the Astros' 18-inning victory that ended the NL division series against Atlanta. Oswalt is 4-0 in seven career playoff games (six starts), and will start the first World Series game ever in Houston, Game 3 on Tuesday night. Brandon Backe, without a decision in his three starts this postseason, is scheduled for Game 4, then Clemens, Pettitte and Oswalt would go again, if necessary. Lidge was warming up at the end Wednesday night. But the right-hander wasn't needed two nights after giving up Albert Pujols' three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning that gave the Cardinals a 5-4 victory and extended the NLCS. "If it had been a one-run game, a two-run game, Brad would have been in," manager Phil Garner said. "We are not here without Brad Lidge. If the game is on the line again in any circumstances, he's our guy." Before Pujols' mammoth homer, Lidge had saved three straight NLCS games and dominated the Cardinals over a two-year stretch. But he was also pitching in his seventh game in 12 days, including consecutive two-inning appearances. Now, Lidge is ready to pitch again after the needed rest. "I just can't wait to get back," Lidge said. ``I'm going to be so pumped up to get out there in the World Series. It's going to be amazing." Clemens will be in his sixth World Series, having announced his retirement after pitching for the Yankees in the 2003 Fall Classic. Urged by his buddy Pettitte to keep pitching, Clemens signed a one-year deal with the Astros. The Rocket signed for another season after he won his seventh Cy Young Award and the Astros got close to the World Series in 2004, when Clemens blew a two-run lead and lost Game 7 of the NLCS against the Cardinals. ``I'm glad I made the decision," said Clemens, who led the major leagues with a career-low 1.87 ERA during the regular season. ``Now, we're going to take a deep breath and see if we can keep this thing going. ... It's great. This is for the city, our fans at home. It's for the entire team, but there are special cases in this." Such as Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, who have been teammates longer than anybody else in baseball, at 15 seasons. ``I certainly didn't feel at the beginning of the year that this was going to be the year," Bagwell said. ``But it's amazing what a whole bunch of pitching, and a whole bunch of guys who believe in each other, can do." Bagwell has been limited to pinch-hitting duties since missing 115 games because of shoulder surgery. He'll likely start as the designated hitter in the games at Chicago.

Former player Neil Harris has been placed in charge until season's end.An official statement was released by club chairman John Berylson.

I would like to thank him for his efforts, and in particular for keeping us in the Championship last May." He added "Ian Holloway remains a fine manager and it was his impressive track record which led us to appoint him some 14 months ago. However, our view is that the decision to part company at this stage is in the best interests of the football club going forward."At the time of Holloway's departure Millwall sat in 23rd position of the Football League Championship, the second tier of English football.

It's almost do or die."Like the first two games, this one was decided by a one-goal margin, but was not as loose as the 6–5 Game 1 or tight as the 2–1 Game 2.The Flyers hit first — converting on their first power play chance — when right-winger Danny Brière, who had been drifting deep in the offensive zone took a pass just in front of the net and put it past Niemi at the 14:58 mark of the first period.

The Knights' lead grew to 50–30 in the fourth quarter."[Kasey Reaber] is just a phenomenal player.

The insurance must cover student athletes while they are competing.The legislation was named after Rasul "Rocky" Clark.  In 2000, the Eisenhower High School football player became paralyzed from the waist down as a result of a tackle during a game.  His school based health insurance covered the costs of his medical treatment.  A legislator sponsoring the bill noted that the need for this type of insurance is rare.  Clark's mother attended the legislation signing.  Her son died last year.Before parents can claim money from school insurance, they first must pay out US$50,000. Schools have until January 1, 2014 to comply with the law.  Schools cannot charge students more than US$5 to defray the cost of insurance.  If a school district already requires student to be covered through private health insurance, they are exempted from this law.Photos have emerged in the Australian media of a 9mm imitation pistol being pointed at swimmers by a coach.

The decision was made at a meeting of the cabinet led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi.Ambika Soni, the Information and Broadcasting Minister stated, "The cabinet approved the proposal of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports for providing a revised budget of Rs. 1,620 crore, as loan to the Organising Committee (OC) of the Commonwealth Games, 2010, at the prevailing government rate of interest."According to the Minister, the organizing board hoped that to generate a net income of approximately Rs. 1,708 crore."The components of rent for organising headquarters, technology which were practically nil in the initial budget, are now around Rs. 175 crore and Rs. 200 crore respectively. These have also contributed substantially to the (budget) increase", said the Minister when asked about the reason for the hike. Sponsorships, TV rights and ticketing were other factors influencing the change.Alongside this, the Queen's Baton Relay will now encompass all the 70 Commonwealth Games Association nations. In the international leg, the number of days has been increased to 240 from the previously approved 136 days while on the domestic leg, there has been an increase from 60 days to 100 days."The number of volunteers has also gone up to nearly 30,000 and hence the cost of accreditation, catering, uniform, on this account has increased," said Soni.Indian cricketer Sourav Ganguly smashed his first Test double century on the second day of the third Test cricket match between India and Pakistan at Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore today. His double century took 324 balls and contained 26 fours and a six. This is also his highest ever score in Test cricket, surpassing the 173 which he made against Sri Lanka at Mumbai in 1997. He was out just before tea, bowled by Danish Kaneria while trying to sweep. He had made 239 off 361 balls with 30 fours and 3 sixes. The Indians were at 611 for 7 in 147 overs at tea with Irfan Pathan at 93 and Anil Kumble at 2 being the batsmen at the crease.Earlier, on the first day, a partnership of 300 runs between Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh had put India in a favorable position afer they had been reduced for 61 for 4 with pacer Yasir Arafat taking 3 wickets. Yuvraj Singh made 169 off 203 balls before being caught by Faisal Iqbal off Mohammad Sami at the fag end of the first day's play.The Indians were all out for 626 in 150.2 overs, the last wicket falling at 2:45 IST. Irfan Pathan made his first Test century in 132 balls and scored 102 which is also his highest score in Test cricket. He was the last batsman to be dismissed.Pakistan commenced their second innings after a short break and made 86 in 27 overs by the end of the day for the loss of Yasir Hameed's wicket. Kumble was the wicket-taker. Salman Butt was not out with 50 off 85 balls while Younis Khan had made 7 off 33 balls.India won the final match of the recent cricket series. Yuvraj Singh made a unbeaten 107 (93b, 15x4)helping India's , chasing 287, achieved with 19 deliveries remaining on a good batting pitch. India have clinched the Hutch Cup ODI series 4-1.  Mahendra Singh Dhoni (77 not out, 56b, 6x4, 4x6) was another important contributor to the Indian Innings.The Pakistani bowling, apart from a probing spell from paceman Rao Iftekar Anjum, was made to look ordinary. The Pakistani fielding let the side down again. Mohammed Sami lost the ball twice. When on 64, Yuvraj was put down at covers by Shoaib Malik.India preferred to rest Sachin Tendulkar and Irfan Pathan. Tendulkar carried the drinks, indicating that in this Indian side experience and youth blended into one.In Tendulkar's absence, Rahul Dravid opened the innings with Gautam Gambhir.The left-handed Gambhir sparkled with a few pick-up shots on the leg-side; this also showed Pakistan's pacemen were not bowling the right line.Mohammed Asif has not been a big factor in the ODIs since the away going delivery is a lesser weapon in this variety of the game, especially if a side is bowling in the afternoon. It was his two-way movement that made him so dangerous in Tests.Gambhir once again wasted a start, but the opening pair had, importantly, raised 69. Dravid's 50 (6x4) might have consumed 82 deliveries, but he made sure that, in the absence of Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar, the Indians had enough wickets in hand before they began the final onslaught. The chase was splendidly orchestrated.It was Sreesanth who dented Pakistan in the morning after Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar shared the new ball. The Kerala paceman, who is learning fast, cut down on his pace realising that there was not too much assistance for him from the wicket. He struck thrice and Pakistan, from 62 without loss, slumped to 77 for three. In the context of the match, Sreesanth's spell of 5-1-25-3 was crucial. Both Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal, after putting together 62, fell to pull shots, and Shoaib Malik steered right into Suresh Raina's hands at gully. There is fluency about Sreesanth's run-up and action that is hard to ignore, and he did bowl well at the death, swinging the ball into the right-hander.And off-spinner Ramesh Powar won a leg-before decision against an ominous looking Inzamam on the sweep; the delivery drifted into the right-hander from outside the off-stump and then straightened.Pakistan recovered through a strokeful fifth-wicket stand of 95 in 110 balls between Mohammad Yousuf (67, 85b, 6x4) and vice-captain Younis Khan (74 not out, 79b, 3x4, 2x6). Yousuf appeared set for his hundred when he flicked Ajit Agarkar into Zaheer Khan at mid-wicket.Abdul Razzaq biffed a 15-ball 24 before miscuing a pull of R.P. Singh, but Pakistan lost some momentum towards the end. However, the 18 runs off the last six balls by Zaheer came in handy for the side; Younis twice smote the left-armer over the mid-wicket ropes.The bowlers, backed by aggressive fielding, had performed a fair job, under the conditions.India defeated Australia in the fourth and final test match of cricket at Nagpur to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by 2-0. India had won the second Test in Mohali by 320 runs taking 1-0 lead. The first Test and the third had ended in a draw. India regained the trophy after a gap of four years.Australia needed 382 runs for victory but were all-out for 209 in 50.2 overs. Australia lost by 172 runs in the match marking the first time it had lost a test series by more than one match since they were trounced by West Indies in 1988-89. Jason Krejza was awarded the man of the match for his 12 wickets in a formidable debut performance.The match was also the last for Sourav Ganguly who had initially declared his retirement at the end of the series. Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, had taken over from Anil Kumble who retired after the third test match of the series at the Ferozshah Kotla stadium.The trophy is named after the two great test players Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar from Australia and India respectively.Scoreboard for final test matchThe Indian cricket team has finally won a Test match in South Africa for the first time ever.Having set the homeside 402 to win, South Africa was all out for 278, India winning by 123 runs and going one-nil up in the three match series.Paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth was one of the heroes for India taking 3/59 after his 5/40 in the first innings. Zaheer Khan picked up 3/79 while leg spinner Anil Kumble finished with 3/54.Ashwell Prince made a valiant 97 before being second last man out, bowled by Kumble.It is a great result for captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell. The former Australian captain has been criticised in the past week by former Indian greats Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri.The Second Test starts on Boxing Day in Durban.India has won the 4-match Pepsi cricket series against West Indies by 3-1 today in Vadodara.India won the match by a huge difference of 160 runs. India made 341 runs in 50 overs by losing 3 wickets. Sachin Tendulkar completed his 41st century in only 76 balls. Mahendra Singh Dhoni made 40 runs in just 20 balls, hitting 1 four and 3 sixes.West Indies played under pressure and lost their wickets in regular intervals. The highest-run partnership of the West Indian innings was of 65 runs between Samuels and Ramdin. The team were all out on 181 runs in 41.4 overs. Agarkar and Kumble took 2 wickets each.Player of the match as well as player of the series, Sachin Tendulkar, performed well. He made his 41st ODI century which is the highest by any player in the One-Day international. He made 191 runs (avg 63.66) and took 3 wickets (avg 37.33) in 4 matches in the series.India have drawn the third Test cricket match against England at The Oval, London, England. The draw means that India win the Test series in England 1-0.This is India's first series win in England since 1986 and England's first home series loss since 2001. In the first Test at Lord's, England started off the match with a first innings of 298, then bowling India out for 201. England then followed that up with a score of 282. India then worked their way to 282/9 before the weather turned for the worse and rain came to their rescue and ended the first test as a draw.The second Test proved a better one for India where the left-arm seamers dominated. After England had been shot out for 198, India took the advantage by starting their innings with a 147 run opening partnership, and India didn't look back. They ended their innings with a score of 481. There could have been centuries had it not been for two horrible umpiring decisions which left Tendulkar on 91 after being wrongly adjudged lbw and Sourav Ganguly was left on 79 after missing a ball going down the leg-side but which the umpire thought he nicked. After England had been bowled out for 355, India went in for the kill and won the Test. There were also several behavioral problems, including Sreesanth's shoulder barge into Michael Vaughan which cost Sreesanth half of his match fee and the jelly bean scandal in which the England players allegedly put jelly beans on the pitch to distract Zaheer Khan. This would prove costly however, as Zaheer Khan got fired up and then went on to take 9 wickets in the match.The third Test proved to be a closer game. Having won the toss and chosen to bat, India racked up a massive 664 in their first innings which included eight half-century partnerships, a first in Tests, and Anil Kumble's maiden Test century. England were then bowled out for 345, well short of the total needed to avoid a possible follow-on, with Ian Bell top scoring with 63. Paul Collingwood and Alastair Cook followed with 62 and 61 respectively. India though, did not enforce the follow-on and opted to bat again. India stuttered to 11/3, losing both opening batsmen within the first four overs, followed by the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar for just one run. Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid however steadied the innings. Ganguly had the highest score of the innings with 57 while Dravid was uncharacteristically slow and scored 12 runs off 96 balls. India declared on 180/6, setting England a massive target of 500 runs. England then batted out the remaining 110 overs of the match to score 369/6, including a century from Kevin Pietersen, ending the match as a draw.A seven-match One-Day International series will be played between the two countries following the Test series, with the first to take place at the Rose Bowl, Hampshire on 21st August.England: A J Strauss, A N Cook, M P Vaughan (capt), K P Pietersen, P D Collingwood, I R Bell, M J Prior (wkt), C T Tremlett, R J Sidebottom, M S Panesar, J M AndersonIndia:  W Jaffer, K D Karthik, R Dravid (capt), S R Tendulkar, S C Ganguly, V V S Laxman, M S Dhoni (wkt), A Kumble, Z Khan, R P Singh, S SreesanthPlayer of the Match: A Kumble (India)Players of the Series: J M Anderson (England) and Z Khan (India)Umpires: S A Bucknor (West Indies) and I L Howell (South Africa)TV umpire: P J HartleyMatch referee: R S Madugalle (Sri Lanka)Reserve umpire: J W LloydsViswanathan Anand, a chess grandmaster from India, has retained the world championship title after a match with Bulgarian challenger Veselin Topalov.The match, consisting of a dozen games, was played in the Bulgarian capital Sofia over the last twenty days.

As Wilson approached the site of the crash, reportedly the nose cone from Karam's car that had been airborne struck Wilson in the helmet; Wilson's car steered to the left and collided with the inside SAFER barrier. The event was placed under the caution flag as safety workers extracted Wilson from his car. Wilson was airlifted to Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania. At 9 P.M. EST, INDYCAR released a statement, announcing that Wilson had suffered a severe head injury, was in critical condition and had fallen into a coma. The following day, Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Doug Boles and Hulman & Company Mark Miles officially announced Wilson's death.Karam was able to walk away from the accident, and was evaluated for a right foot injury; he was released from the hospital the same day. Wilson's Andretti Autosport teammate Ryan Hunter-Reay won the race, though he did not celebrate upon finding out about Wilson's accident. In Victory Lane, he stated, "My first thoughts are with Justin, for sure[...] He's a friend, a teammate, and it's a bit hard not knowing anything."Wilson, a former Formula One and Champ Car driver, did not have a ride entering the 2015 season, and joined Andretti on a seven-race deal. The contract had previously been for two races, but after acquiring sponsorship, the deal was increased by five events; earlier in August, Wilson recorded a best finish of second at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.The accident led to discussions regarding the safety of the cars. A suggestion had been the addition of a canopy over the car's cockpit. The topic had been controversial: while some supported it for safety reasons, others opposed it because of history, possibly affecting the aerodynamics of the car, limiting one's peripheral vision and movement inside the car, and worry about escaping an upside-down or burning car. Another had been to tether the nose cone to the car; Hunter-Reay mentioned renderings developed of a boomerang-like debris-deflector positioned in front of the driver. A further question raised had been regarding Wilson's height: at 6 feet, 3.5 inches (1.92 m) tall, Wilson was the tallest IndyCar Series driver; however, driver Josef Newgarden refuted the statement, saying, "They make a regulation for how tall you can be inside the car sitting compared to the roll hoop [...] It's safe for any height for any driver that gets in the car."Thursday, July 22, 2010 Thursday, July 22, 2010 (On Tuesday) the sixteenth stage of the Tour de France, tracing 199.5 km of mountainous terrain between Bagnères-de-Luchon, in Midi-Pyrénées, and Pau, in Aquitaine, saw the victory of Frenchman Pierrick Fédrigo followed by his compatriot Sandy Casar and Spaniard Rubén Plaza.

We will look on these two additional referees and we avoid considering any goal-line technology during this time."FIFA President Sepp Blatter said the move was necessary to maintain the universal spirit of the game: "We have 260 million people directly involved in the game. If we maintain the laws of the game ... it's so easy to understand ... We have to live with errors, football has to keep its human face.""We have to maintain the laws of the game in their simplicity. Do you want technical devices to take decisions? That's why, after three years of tests with no conclusions, I am in favour of putting the whole thing on ice," Blatter explained.UEFA president Michel Platini agreed: "Football should stay human, but two more officials can help, especially around the goal." Platini made the suggestion to freeze all investigations into technology and to try two additional assistants behind each goal.Blatter said the system using the microchip "was very complicated, needing electrified lines on the field of play and other devices including antennae and when we tested it in Tokyo last year there was one mistake during the seven matches we used as an experiment at the Club World Championship." With regards to the system using cameras, he pointed to "problems with players obscuring the views of the cameras, or of flares or weather conditions."The system of the extra referees will be tested at an upcoming FIFA or UEFA tournament, and a final ruling is expected at next year's meeting, according to FIFA's Jerome Valcke.Hawk-Eye, the company that was working on the goal-line technology that is already being used for line calls in tennis, reacted with disappointment: "I'm livid, it is completely out of the blue... A year ago they met and gave us four criteria to meet and we have met all of them, yet they have kicked it out now... We have invested an awful lot of money and now we have no return on that investment," director Paul Hawkins said. He said he was encouraged to continue research on the project only 10 days ago at a private showing for IFAB members at Reading's Madejski Stadium.While the Welsh FA were also against the idea, the English Football Association supported the use of technology and was hoping to start using it by next season. The FA clubs and referees supported the use of Hawk-Eye technology, said Mike Foster, general secretary of the English Premier League. A spokesperson of the Premier League said that "A lot of time, money and effort has gone into developing a system that meets all the criteria laid down last year." The Scottish and Northern Irish FA also voted in favour of the goal-line technology.FA chief executive Brian Barwick expressed his disappointment at the annual meeting of the IFAB in Gleneagles, Scotland:  "We were in favour of goal-line technology but there will be no more experiments and it will not be back on the agenda next year, or in the foreseeable future." FIFA President Blatter denied ulterior motives for the decision: "There has been no change of heart. Referees make decisions, not machines... I have defended goal-line technology but it has become clear that such systems are too complicated and very costly. Nor would they necessarily add anything positive to the game and could harm the authority of the referee."In a response published Saturday by The Associated Press, the International Paralympic Committee commented on Russian adherence to the Olympic Truce in regards to the country's actions in the Ukraine, saying "As with situations around the world, we hope a peaceful resolution can be found in the spirit of the Olympic Truce, which has covered the Paralympic Games since 2006. [...] We want the story here to be the great festival of sport that has already taken place in Sochi and will continue now that athletes are arriving for the start of the Winter Paralympics."In the past few days, Russian troops entered the Ukrainian Crimea and took control of a number of strategic locations, including an airport and a regional parliament.  Yesterday, Russian forces surrounded a Crimean Ukrainian military base.While the Russian-hosted Olympic Games officially ended on February 23, the Olympic period officially concludes on March 16 at the closing ceremony for the 2014 Winter Paralympics.The Olympic Truce and its extension to the Paralympic Games is recognized by the United Nations, who did so in A/65/270, para.7, an addition recognised by the United Nations General Assembly in August 2010.The Crimea region of the Ukraine is located less than 500 kilometers (less than 300 miles) away from Sochi.  The  British Paralympic team have  said they are continuing to monitor the situation, but  has no current plans to make changes regarding their participation at the Games. The United States Paralympic team has said they haven't made any changes to their plans in response to the situation.Yesterday, the United Kingdom's Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter, "Because of the serious situation in Ukraine, @WilliamJHague & I believe it would be wrong for UK Ministers to attend the Sochi Paralympics."London, England — Yesterday, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) held their first formal press conference as part of the 2012 Summer Paralympics.  Approximately 60 media representatives attended and had the opportunity to ask questions of Craig Spence, IPC President Philip Craven, Chairman of the London Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralymic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, and LOCOG Director of Communications and Public Affairs Jackie Brock-Doyle following a short speech on the history of the Paralympic Games.The reporters asked a variety of questions. A British journalist asked about having ATOS as a sponsor given the negative history the business has had with disability services in the country. The IPC responded by saying this is an issue that should be taken up by the relevant British government agency.  A Wikinews reporter asked if the high cost of technology for participating in disability sport at the elite level would leave Oceania, Asia, and Africa behind. Craven said historically, the IPC has worked on increasing disability sport participation; they were now working on changing that to developing disability sport around the world.  He highlighted efforts by the IPC to bring down the cost of wheelchairs and prostheses as these are sporting equipment for participation in disability sport. He also said they had donated 4,000 wheelchairs to help spread disability sport.A Canadian journalist from the Vancouver Sun asked about the lack of substantial coverage of the Games in North America. Craven responded by saying he was disappointed by United States coverage and the IPC has been aware of the problem for years. He contrasted the situation in the United States with France, where the public successfully put pressure on the rights-holding network to improve the coverage of the Games.Another reporter asked about Paralympic social media usage during the Games.  Craven responded that while not a big user of it himself, the IPC embraced social media. Spence said the IPC encouraged everyone involved to use it; 47 Paralympians have video blogs, and the Opening Ceremonies will be covered while they happen.On Wednesday, United States film director Steven Spielberg withdrew from his position as artistic adviser to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. "Conscience will not allow me to continue with business as usual," he said."Sudan's government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these ongoing crimes but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more to end the continuing human suffering there," Spielberg's statement said. "China's economic, military and diplomatic ties to the government of Sudan continue to provide it with the opportunity and obligation to press for change."China immediately expressed regret over his decision and suggested that "ulterior motives" may be at play. "It is understandable if some people do not understand the Chinese government policy on Darfur, but I am afraid that some people may have ulterior motives, and this we cannot accept. ... China is also concerned about the humanitarian situation in Darfur. [But] empty rhetoric will not help. We hope that relevant people will be more pragmatic," said Liu Jianchao, the Deputy-Director General of the Information Department in China's foreign ministry.Following Spielberg's withdrawal, other organizations called for boycott of the Games. However, United Kingdom Minister for the Olympics Tessa Jowell rejected such calls. "The world has known for the last seven years that Beijing would host the Olympics," Jowell told The Times. "Most progressive governments accept that there are wholly unacceptable aspects of Chinese policy, but that did not stop the International Olympic Committee awarding them the games. A call for a boycott doesn't serve any purpose and it would be a great pity. This doesn't mean, however, we should be distracted from the urgency of Darfur.""China is also concerned about the humanitarian issues there, but we have been playing a positive and constructive role in promoting peace in Darfur," Liu said, adding that China is working with the United Nations to provide aid and resolve the crisis.Critics of China contend that China supports the Islamic regime in Sudan because it buys two-thirds of the country's oil exports and also sells it weapons. Further, China has been defending the government in Khartoum in the United Nations Security Council. Since 2003, fighting between government-backed militia and rebels in Darfur has led to the death of more than 200,000 people and displaced some 2.5 million others.Meanwhile, United States President George W. Bush confirmed that he still plans to attend the Games in Beijing. "I view the Olympics as a sporting event. On the other hand, I have a different platform to Steven Spielberg, so I get to talk to Hu Jintao [President of China] and I do remind him he can do more to relieve the suffering in Darfur."Bush followed this by saying: "I’m not going to use the Olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the Chinese people in a public way because I do it all the time with the president."On Wednesday, the International Tennis Federation banned 29-year-old Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova for two years after she tested positive on January 26 for the drug meldonium. The drug was banned on January 1 this year.Sharapova said she was not aware of the ban and continued to take it after January 1 under a trade name, mildronate. Mildronate or meldonium is a heart disease drug, and Sharapova said she was consuming it for a decade, due to heart concerns and as some of her family members have been diagnosed with diabetes.Five-time Grand Slam winner Sharapova lost to Serena Williams in this year's Australian Open quarter-finals. The ban runs until January 26, 2018; she said she would appeal against it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.She posted on her Facebook account, "Today with their decision of a two year suspension, the ITF tribunal unanimously concluded that what I did was not intentional. The tribunal found that I did not seek treatment from my doctor for the purpose of obtaining a performance enhancing substance."A number of relatively unknown entrants made the Taiwan 2008 Invitational Games for the Deaf soccer tournament an unpredictable event. Teams from Thailand, Australia, Iran (Silver Medalist in soccer at the 2005 Summer Deaflympics), Uzbekistan, Malaysia, and Japan took part.On September 6, soccer giants Thailand and Iran defeated Malaysia and Uzbekistan in shutouts of 11-0 and 9-0 respectively. Anothai Sathiyamat, Somsak Thongdee, Nares Numphakdee of Thailand all scored hat-tricks in the game against Uzbekistan.On the second day of competition, a decisive battle in Group A between Japan and Iran was keenly watched by Thailand, as one of the two teams would be their opponent in the finals. The game was scoreless in the first half, with conservative tactics from both teams.Iran's Mostafa Heydaribondarabadi scored rapidly after the second half started, but Shun Igasaki of Japan scored a penalty kick after a foul by Iran in the penalty area and tied the score again. The penalty became the key of the match when Tetsuya Kurata scored 5 minutes further in, as the Iranian players became frustrated by the penalty kick. Finally, Japan won with a final score of 2-1, and advanced to the championship match on the final day.After group standings were mostly stabilized in the third day of competition, Thailand and Japan handled their respective Group matches by replacing several substitutes with frequently lined-up players to defeat their opponents easily. They will face off on the final day for the gold medal of soccer event in the "Invitational Games for the Deaf, Taipei 2008".The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has lifted a ban on Iraqi athletes participating in the Beijing Olympics. The IOC placed a ban on the country's participation on July 24 claiming a political influence within Iraq's national Olympic committee. This came after the Iraqi government's suspension of the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Iraq in May 2008.File:LogoBeijing2008.jpgThe decision to remove the ban is a result of the Iraqi government's agreement to allow free elections for their National Olympic Committee while under international scrutiny. "The National Olympic Committee will have fair elections before the end of November," said Pere Miro, Director of the IOC's relation with NOC's. In the meantime, Iraq's NOC will be run by a interim Committee approved by the IOC. Even though the ban has been lifted, five of the seven athletes are still unable to participate due to the final date of selections having passed. Two athletes participating in sprinting and rowing are expected to compete.There has been some who believed that Iraq has been treated wrongly in the matter of their NOC. Ahmed Tabour, head of the Cultural and Sports Committee stated that "Iraq was never suspended during the days of Saddam [Hussein], who personally appointed the national Olympic committee. The Iraqi people need hope, and sport gives them a lot of hope."The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has given the late Jack Poole their highest honour, The Olympic Order, according to a report by the Vancouver Sun.Mr. Poole, one of the people behind the bid by Vancouver to host the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, passed away on October 23 after losing a fight with pancreatic cancer.The CEO of the Vancouver organizing committee (VANOC), John Furlong, was quoted as saying "Jack Poole is truly deserving of the tremendous honour of the Olympic Order in recognition of his enormous contribution to the 2010 Games," also stating that further comment will be made when the IOC makes a formal announcement of the award.This marks the second award that has posthumously been given to Poole, having been awarded the Canadian Olympic Order by the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) earlier in the month, with word that he will also be inducted to the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame.File:Merchandising Madrid2020.JPGThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) Evaluation Commission is in Madrid, Spain this week as part of the city's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics.Sir Craig Reedie of Great Britain is leading the IOC delegation, whom Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy greeted at the start of their inspection process. Of the fourteen-member bid delegation, five have been through this process before as part of the city's failed bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Olympics bids.On a cold but sunny day yesterday, the IOC visited four sites on their first inspection date including Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Buen Retiro park and bullfighting ring Las Ventas.  Today, the IOC is scheduled to visit the proposed venues for the Olympic village and stadium.  The inspection is scheduled to last four days.While at Santiago Bernabéu, IOC members met the Spanish national football team captain Iker Casillas and were given Real Madrid jerseys with their names on them.As Spain is currently undergoing severe economic problems at the moment, with 26% unemployment currently and public debt in 2012 at 84% of the country's gross domestic product, the €1.5bn (US$1.9bn, £1.3bn) costs of the Games have been a highly visible aspect of the city's bid process. Security costs are estimated to add another  €149m (US$192m, £127m) to organizing costs. Proponents of the bid including Madrid's mayor Ana Botella believe the Games would provide an economic boost to the city and the country. IOC President Jacques Rogge is also on the record as stating that he does not believe Spanish economic problems will play a part in the IOC's decision-making process.  Spanish newspaper El Mundo quoted Rogge saying, "The crisis does not affect it, because substantial facilities have in most cases already been built. No major investment is needed".Botella outlined some of the costs, quoted by the Associated Press during the IOC visit saying, "The budget that remains for the construction of infrastructure, some 1.5 billion [euros] divided between the three administrations responsible and over a period of seven years, is a perfectly affordable amount." Local organizers have promised to follow the legacy of London, using historical landmarks and existing venues with 80% of proposed venues, 28 of 35, already in place, and providing a roadmap for future development of Olympic sites to avoid any "white elephants" that are unused after the Games, a situation that happened with a number of Athens Olympic venues. Madrid's bid Chief Executive Victor Sánchez, quoted by Agence France-Presse, explained they avoided "[p]rojects that have no real use for citizens after the Games have finished. That is why we have given priority to existing infrastructures and then to other infrastructures that the city has a direct need for. Finally, where a future use cannot be guaranteed, we have opted for temporary solutions. Only three such temporary solutions will be used, while a mere four permanent facilities remain to be built. The result is lower costs, reduced environmental impact and less disruption to the everyday lives of the people of Madrid, all with government backing at central, regional and municipal level."Local organizers are preparing to cope with protesters trying to draw attention to Spain's labor situation who planned to picket outside the Hotel Eurostars Madrid Tower where IOC members are staying. The planned protest is over cuts to the Municipal Government budget. Protesters did not picket yesterday, which was a holiday in Madrid.  Bid organizers and the government feared potential strikes by people working for the public transport system. Botella explained to the media that protests and work stoppages should not be seen as evidence that Spaniards would not welcome the Games, but rather unhappiness with local economic issues, which Botella said the Games should help fix. Spain's current unemployment level is the highest of any European country  and the worst the country has faced since the 1970s. Botella's view is supported by an IOC survey, which found 81% of Spaniards supported Madrid's bid for the Games.Madrid is one of three cities currently competing for the 2020 Games.  The IOC visited Tokyo, Japan earlier this month and is scheduled to visit Istanbul, Turkey later this month.  The host city is to be formally selected at a meeting of the IOC on September 7 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.   Shortly after that, Rogge is scheduled to step down from his position as IOC President.The Iowa Hawkeyes (6-6) came into the Alamo Bowl as underdogs to the Texas Longhorns (10-3), 18th-ranked and defending national champions.  It probably came as a surprise to the entire Alamo Bowl record crowd of 65,875 as Iowa ran out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter.  Iowa almost extended their lead to 21-3 just before the half, but for a touchdown pass called back for an illegal receiver who lined up on the Iowa line of scrimmage. Texas quarterback Colt McCoy, who began the season as a red-shirt freshman, capped the Texas comeback in the 3rd quarter with a 72-yard pass to tailback Jamaal Charles to take the lead at 20-14.Tate connected again with Brodell to put Iowa back in the lead, 21-20. Brodell led the Hawks in offence with 6 receptions for 159 yards. In the fourth quarter, Selvin Young capped a Texas drive by rushing 2 yards to make it 26-21, as the Longhorns failed to make the 2-point conversion.  Iowa then marched downfield and Kyle Schlicher kicked a 38-yard field goal to pull Iowa within two points at 26-24 with 11 minutes left in the game.  With just a field goal needed and nearly five minutes to go, Iowa was given a gift when a short 19-yard punt put Iowa in possession near midfield.  Iowa coach Kirk Fernetz then tried a bit of trickery which doomed Iowa's hopes.  Texas safety Marcus Griffin tackled Dominique Douglas for a 9-yard loss on a reverse wide-receiver pass on first down.  Iowa could not convert and had to punt three plays later, and Texas successfully ran out the clock to win the game.Coach Ferentz immediately claimed the blame for the risky play call.  "It's totally my fault. I'm sick over it," Ferentz said. "Guys competed that long and that hard and that put us in a bad situation."Yesterday in La Molina, Spain, IPC Alpine World Championships event organizers changed the competition owing to poor weather predicted later in the week with the Super-G now set to be run today.Skiers were expecting to have the day off, with a Sport Forum originally on the schedule for today and the Super-G on the schedule for tomorrow.  Some skiers competing were not scheduled to arrive in La Molina until today. The race is scheduled to start at 10:30 European Central Standard Time.  There are 6 scheduled starters for the women's visually impaired group including yesterday's downhill gold medalist Henrieta Farkašová, 11 women in the standing group, 8 women in the sitting group, 16 men in the visually impaired group including Spaniards Jon Santacana and Gabriel Gorce, 22 men in the standing group including Australian Mitchell Gourley and New Zealander Adam Hall, and 29 men in the sitting groupLondon, England — At a press conference in London yesterday the President of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), Sir Philip Craven, criticized media coverage of the Paralympic Games in the United States and Canada.In the United States, NBC is running only four one-hour highlights packages. Canada's CBC is doing only slightly better, with one hour of highlights each night of competition. This contrasts with extensive coverage in the United Kingdom, France, and other countries. Sir Philip told the fifty-plus attendees which included Lord Coe, "some people feel that North America lead on everything, and on this they don't.  And it's about time they caught up." He said he was very disappointed for the athletes, the people, and the organizations. The Paralympic Committee has tried to fill the void with streaming video over the internet.  According to Tony Naar from the Australian Paralympic Committee, his American counterparts were "defensive" about the arrangement whereby they bought the television rights and sold them on to NBC. Referring to previous Australian coverage he said, "[t]hat is where we were back in 1996, so they are that far behind."London, England — At an International Paralympic Committee (IPC) press conference this morning, they announced unless the South Africa Paralympic Committee could provide evidence that athletes were changing prosthetics, in violation of the rules, the IPC would be dropping their cheating investigation.The investigation was launched after the South African Paralympic Committee sent the IPC a formal letter of complaint following Oscar Pistorius raising concerns in the mixed zone following his silver medal finish in the 200 meters. The South Africans alleged runners from other countries were cheating by being measured using one set of competition prosthetics, then using different prosthetics during the race.The IPC sent representatives to the track to ask coaches if they were aware of changes between prosthetics being measured and being used on the track.  According to the IPC, coaches were surprised to be asked this, as it would be extremely difficult to transition between differing prosthetics due to required changes in stride.Sebastion Coe, London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games President, said Oscar had made his comments on possible cheating in the heat of the moment, and the organization should not be involved in situations like the one with Pistorius.London, England— Five Paralympians were inducted into the Visa Paralympic Hall of Fame in a ceremony in London last Thursday. The five were Louise Sauvage, Roberto Marson, Trischa Zorn-Hudson, Frank Ponta, and Chris Holmes. Between them, they have won 100 Paralympic medals. The ceremony was hosted by Chris Wadell, a Paralympic skier who was himself inducted into the Hall of Fame at the 2010 Winter Paralympics, alongside Sir Philip Craven, the current President of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Louise Sauvage, an Australian Paralympic wheelchair racer, won thirteen Paralympic medals – including nine gold medals, was presented by Sir Philip Craven with a set of pins from the last six summer Paralympics. She noted that she had been to all of them, and is currently in London as a coach. Two of her new protégées attended the Hall of Fame induction.Roberto Marson was an Italian athlete, fencer, and swimmer who won 26 Paralympic medals, including sixteen golds in his career, died last November. His award was a posthumous one, accepted on his behalf by his daughter.Trischa Zorn-Hudson, from the United States, is the most successful Paralympian of all time, having won 55 medals,  of which 41 were gold. Her medal tally also included nine silver and five bronze. Today, she works with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; helping disabled veterans to achieve their potential. Wadell noted this brings the Paralympics full circle, the Games having began with disabled servicemen.Frank Ponta was an Australian athlete, swimmer, fencer, and basketball player, who was influential in the development of wheelchair sport in Australia. As an athlete, he won a silver medal at the first Paralympic games in Rome in 1960; as a coach, he trained the likes of Louise Sauvage and Priya Cooper. He died in June last year, and was another posthumous inductee.Finally, Chris Holmes, a British swimmer who won sixteen medals, including nine golds, during his Paralympic career. He is very busy these days with, in his words, "a sporting event that is going on in London at the moment".This is the fourth time that Visa have hosted such an event. For the first time, the IPC invited members of the public to nominate athletes and coaches. Nominations also came from the national Paralympic committees, and international sporting bodies. The inductions are conducted every two years, alternating between winter and summer Paralympics. According to Sir Philip Craven, the Hall of Fame is both a way of celebrating sporting achievement, and of creating a sort of corporate memory.To be eligible, nominees must have competed in at least two games, the more the better; and won, or coached athletes who have won, multiple medals, again the more the better. They must have retired before the previous games, in this case before Beijing in 2008. However, the award also recognizes sportsmanship and service to the Paralympic community.Sochi, Russia — At a press conference today in the Main Press Center in Sochi, International Paralympic Committee (IPC) President Sir Philip Craven repeatedly said the Paralympic Games should be about sports, not politics.  Craven went on to say that much of the discussion about the politics of sport took place because the media had a void to fill before the start of sporting events, and he thought it would die down after the Games got under way.Craven also remarked  that it was better to create change from the inside, rather than the outside.  In response to a question from a French journalist about the decision of French leaders not to attend the opening ceremonies tonight, Craven said he was disappointed for the athletes because the politicians were making a choice to make this about politics, and not about sport.  Craven repeated the Games should be about sport.  Craven said in response to another question it would be possible for the Ukrainians to boycott the opening ceremony IPC Communications Director Craig Spence said that the Ukraine Paralympic Committee delayed their welcome ceremony into the Paralympic Village by two hours yesterday, and the IPC approved the decision.  The story that the Ukrainians delayed their welcome ceremony as a political statement was one the IPC would investigate, and would largely be contingent upon what they said at the press conference the Ukrainians called for today at 1:30PM Sochi local time (0930 UTC).   He said the world and the Paralympic movement is aware of the situation in the Ukraine, but the IPC needs to stay true to its mission.Sir Philip Craven initially started his remarks at the press conference talking about the legacy of the Paralympic Games in terms of accessibility of sports in Sochi.  He also talked about how he was excited for the Games to start.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has told the Iraqi Olympic Committee that Iraq can not field a team in the 2008 Summer Olympics, which are due to open in Beijing, China August 8, 2008.  The International Olympic committee said that it took this action "as a consequence of the ongoing political interference by the government within the sports movement in Iraq." The Iraqi government suspended its Olympic Committee, the National Olympic Committee of Iraq, which they viewed as dysfunctional for several reasons, including the holding of illegitimate meetings, having officials serve past their post and living outside of the country. Interference by government is not permitted by the IOC.  The government of Iraq has said that the decision undermines the effort athletes put into getting a place in the Iraqi Olympic team. Dana Hussain, one of the sprinters who would have been on the Iraqi team, was reported to be distraught by the decision. According to her coach she was "crying for about two hours." Her coach compared the decision to "finding out that a close relative has died."The deadline to register for five of the seven would-be Iraqi Olympians has passed. However, if the National Olympic Committee of Iraq is reinstated, the possibility exists that its two sprinters may be able to compete, if they register before the track and field deadline at the end of July.The governing body of world football, FIFA, has threatened Iraq with expulsion after the Iraqi Olympic Committee (IOC) took control of the country's governing body of football and disbanded it. FIFA has given the country 72 hours to restore the Iraq Football Association (IFA); if this is not done, the case is to be referred to FIFA’s emergency committee.The IFA and the IOC have disputed over who controls the game in the country for several years. The IOC has blamed the IFA for the FIFA ban on the country not being allowed to host international friendly matches due to security reasons. Since the 2003 invasion by American forces, Iraq has hosted two internationals matches, both against Palestine. They are due to play against the United Arab Emirates tomorrow, but the general ban still remains in place.A statement was released on the FIFA website said: "FIFA appeals once more to all stakeholders in Iraq to respect the autonomy of sport in general and the IFA in particular and to allow IFA to conduct its affairs according its statutes and those of FIFA."Should the case be passed over to FIFA’s emergency committee, it would most likely result in a ban from the sport.The Irish supporters, who in the past have won the FIFA Fair Play Award, are angry after a blatant double handball by Thierry Henry enabled France to score the extra-time goal that cost Ireland entry to next year’s FIFA World Cup finals in South Africa. Most Irish anger has been directed at FIFA, although French captain Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball. FAI has argued that there is a strong precedent; in 2005 where FIFA invalidated the result of a FIFA World Cup qualification match between Uzbekistan and Bahrain on the basis of a technical error by the match referee. However, Law 5 of the Laws of the Game state that: "The decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match, are final." and a source at Fifa headquarters in Switzerland said that “there is no way the game can be replayed”. The generic concept of fair play is a fundamental part of the game of football and the Fair Play Campaign was conceived largely as an indirect result of the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, when the handball goal by Diego Maradona.The referee Martin Hansson and (referee's assistants) Stefan Wittberg and Fredrik Nilsson were unable to see the incident but didn't ask Thierry Henry if he handled the ball. Its hoped the mistake won't cost the Swedish referee's a place in South Africa. FIFA's Fair play policy is playing by the rules, using common sense and respecting fellow players, referees, opponents and fans. The French union representing the nation’s gym teachers declared outrage at what it called “indisputable cheating.”Minister for Sport Martin Cullen wrote to FIFA president Sepp Blatter urging him to call a rematch in the interests of fair play. Taoiseach Brian Cowen raised the issue with French president Nicolas Sarkozy on the fringes of last night’s EU summit. French Prime minister François Fillon said “neither the French government nor the Irish Government should interfere in the functioning of the international federation”.After what was almost certain defeat, Ireland's Padraig Harrington has come back to win the 136th British Open in playoff after Spain's Sergio Garcia missed what should have been a game winning putt. Harrington originally was knocked out of the game when he landed his ball twice in Carnoustie Golf Links' infamous Burry Burn leading him to a double bogey. However, Garica bogeyed on the same hole leading to a playoff.The two men had tied 277, seven under par.Ireland won the opening RBS 6 Nations match 26-16 last Saturday. The match, pitting Italy vs. Ireland at Lansdowne Road, was not the game many thought it would be.  The Italian side Captained by Marco Bortolami showed that the Azzuri were a force to be reckoned with.  "In the first 20 minutes we really hadn't much ball and didn't get into many attacking positions.  They got their confidence out of that and they took the game to us. It was an ugly game of rugby by any standards," said Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan.The question to be asked is whether or not Italy played well, or Ireland played poorly.  "If you go to the Stade de France and play like that you're going to get obliterated," stated Brian O'Driscoll the Ireland Skipper.  Italian Boss Pierre Berbizier said, "Against the Irish we succeeded in stopping the opposing attacks."  Staying confident of their impressive show against the Irish, Italy's squad to face England next weekend remains unchanged.The jury in the Isiah Thomas sexual harassment trial revealed a guilty verdict Tuesday, ruling that the current New York Knicks coach subjected former Madison Square Garden executive Anucha Browne Sanders to unwanted sexual advances and verbal insults.In a minor victory for Thomas, the ruling also said that Thomas will not have to pay punitive damages.  However, Thomas' employer, Madison Square Garden, was also found guilty of harassment and will have to pay millions dollars worth of punitive damages to Browne Sanders.  The ugly three-week trial originated with a US$10 million lawsuit filed by Browne Sanders, the former senior vice president of marketing and business operations for the Knicks.  She was fired by the team in December of 2006, and following her dismissal she filed the explosive lawsuit alleging that Madison Square Garden fostered an environment of sexism and inequality, personified by the conduct of Isiah Thomas.  She stated that Thomas repeatedly called her a "bitch" and a "ho", and pressured her to kiss him and said that he loved her.  She also stated that the firing was the result of her filing a complaint about Thomas. Madison Square Garden, and the coach known for his charismatic and emotional demeanor, denied the charges.After the guilty verdict was read, a relieved Browne Sanders hugged her family and friends who were present at the trial.  Thomas met with his lawyers, and while leaving the courthouse stated, "“I’m innocent, very innocent, and I did not do the things she has accused me in this courtroom of doing. I’m extremely disappointed that the jury did not see the facts in this case. I will appeal this, and I remain confident in the man that I am and what I stand for and the family that I have.”Madison Square Garden is also expected to appeal the decision.Having come back in the final minute of time to draw 1-1 with Israel in Tel Aviv two months ago, Brian Kerr's squad were determined not to let it happen a second time in last nights sell out Lansdowne Road Group 4 World Cup qualifier clash. However despite two early goals for the Republic of Ireland, the Israelis still managed to claw back a draw - much to the dismay of onlooking Irish supporters.After just five minutes, Ian Harte scored from a 25 yard free kick putting the homeside ahead just like in the first match. However unlike in the first game, the Irish did not slow down the pace and become conservative. At the 11th minute mark, Robbie Keane scored Ireland's second goal of the match; much to the delight - and even moreso relief of the Irish supporters in the crowd of 34,000.In a seemingly comfortable position, disaster hit the Irish team when Robbie Keane left for the bench with a shoulder injury sustained in the third minute of the game. As the 40th minute approached, Israel's Benayoun and Avi Yehiel combined efforts to put the ball in the back of the Irish net to bring their team back into the game. Things went from bad to worse for the Irish as the first half drew to a close with John O'Shea getting a yellow card in the Irish box - and giving his opposition a penalty. The penalty was scored three time by Nimni, but only on his third attempt did it count - the first two disallowed because the referee had not blown his whistle.The second half proved to be less fruitious for both teams, with no goals scored. The Irish became increasingly frustrated as the game progressed because of perceived Israeli time-wasting. As the game became more scrappy Andy O'Brien got sent off when he attempted to block the Israeli keeper from punching the ball.The game finished 2-2, much to the despair of the Irish squad, who now can only draw encouragement from the fact that they remain ahead of France in the group table.On Monday, the Israel Judo Association responded after organisers of the judo grand slam in Abu Dhabi told chairman of the Israel Judo Association Moshe Ponte Israeli athletes would not be permitted to wear the Israeli flag or symbols, or bear the country's name on their judo uniform.Ponte communicated with Miri Regev, Israeli minister of Culture and Sports, and considered withdrawing the team from the grand slam, which is scheduled to be held from October 26 to 28. Regev wrote a letter addressing Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, which read, "The demand to appear without national symbols is contrary to the mandate of international sports associations, the main aim of which is to separate politics from sport, and strengthen sport as a bridge and connection between peoples, cultures and countries." She also wrote, "It is the obligation of any country which has the privilege of hosting an international competition to allow the competing athletes to represent the country honorably while ensuring their security." Officials of the Abu Dhabi judo grand slam said the players would not be allowed to bear Israel's code "ISR" on their back, nor would it appear on the scoreboard, and the Israeli national anthem would not be played if any Israeli judoka wins a gold medal. However, the Israel Judo Association said, "We won't be dragged into the political arena and won't award prizes to those who want to deter us from appearing all over the world." Twelve Israeli judokas are expected to compete in the grand slam in the capital of the UAE. They would represent the International Judo Federation, and their jersey would show an "IJF" tag.About two years ago, Israeli athletes faced the same situation in the grand slam in the UAE's capital, and Regev asked for an emergency meeting then.In last year's Olympics in Rio de Janiro, after losing to Israeli judoka Or Sasson, Islam El Shehaby of Egypt refused to shake hands. The International Olympic Committee said this gesture "was contrary to the rules of fair play and against the spirit of friendship embodied in the Olympic values."During the opening ceremony of the same tournament, the Israeli team were denied by Lebanese athletes to share a bus, even physically blocking the entrance to prevent Israelis from boarding the bus. Israeli's sailing coach Udi Gal, in a Facebook post, wrote, "How could they let this happen on the eve of the Olympic Games? Isn't this the opposite of what the Olympics represents?".On Wednesday, Italian football club SSC Napoli announced Carlo Ancelotti as their new manager via their official website.

After a good chance of Roma scoring in the opening minutes of the match, the entire game was played in the middle of the field and neither team seemed eager to score. Accusations were taken further as the Italian Consumer Union, Codacons, called for fans to ask for their money back, since the game result was allegedly fixed.

Daisuke Matsuzaka recorded the win with a 1.38 ERA and was named the tournament's most valuable player. The game was played in PETCO Park before a crowd of 42,696.

"My players showed me a fantastic performance tonight," Sadaharu Oh, the team's coach, said through a translator after the game. "I know they did it for Japan." Most people agree that this victory has driven home the fact that baseball is now an international sport, not just an American sport. The team has stuck with the tournament, through bad calls and good alike, and the reward was the sterling silver trophy presented to them as champions of the World Baseball Classic. Even Ichiro Suzuki was amazed by their work, saying "To be honest, I never imagined we'd get there. We had a great team, the best. I hope we showed everyone what a great sport baseball is." Cuba's amazing run was stopped short, but beisbol was still at the top of Cuba's mind after the defeat. “Personally, I think we have shown the quality of Cuban players,” Cuba manager Higinio Velez said. “I told everybody to have patience. I said we are team of men, not names.” The Cuban team barreled through so many major leaguers, but today everything cracked, especially the pitching. However, they never gave up, rallying in the last inning, but just like Frederich Cepeda said, “We went and fought for this game just like every other game in this tournament, but Japan also went out and fought for this game. We tried to get back on top, but they played better than we did and they deserve the victory because they played better.” Due to the deal that allowed Cuba into the WBC, they are donating all their money to Hurricane Katrina Victims.MLB commissioner and WBC organizer Bud Selig admitted, "The intensity in the stands as well as the intensity on the playing field was absolutely remarkable, and I'm not sure that going into it you could have felt that. I'm very confident that this will be the platform that we use to take this sport internationally to the dimension that I want to take it and believe that we will."  Spikes worn by Oh, a jersey worn by Matsuzaka, a baseball cap worn by Nobuhiko Matsunaka, a helmet worn by Ichiro, and a warm-up jacket worn by Koji Uehara, will all be sent to Cooperstown's Baseball Hall of Fame to be displayed.Australia and Japan played out a scoreless draw in front of sixty five and a half thousand spectators at Yokohama International Stadium in Japan.

Namely Scott Chipperfield (after 21 minutes), Luke Wilkshire (25 minutes) and Carl Valeri (1 minute into 2nd half added time).Japan managed to open up Australia's left hand side and create a number of chances up front. Unfortunately for the Japanese, the chances resulted in corners and near misses at best."It's a great result," said Tim Cahill, Australia's makeshift striker. "They've had five weeks preparing, we've had two days. We will take that result - and I'm sure they will too."The result sees them two wins clear of Bahrain, who would play-off for fifth overall in Asia if qualification happened after four games per team."You've got to look at the table," Cahill said. "We're six points clear of the team in third (Bahrain). We're sitting pretty and so are Japan.""It's frustrating not to take three points at home," said Japan coach Takeshi Okada, who had admitted his job was in trouble. "We did everything but put the ball in the net. But it's about qualifying for the World Cup. We have four games left and have to keep pushing."Hawker, Australian Capital Territory — Tonight, the Japanese national team beat the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) softball team 1–0 in the first of a two game series before Japan plays a three game test series against the Australian national team.The game was a low scoring pitching duel.  Japan brought five pitchers to Canberra for their Australian tour.  Since the last Olympics, Japan has been in a rebuilding period.  The side is young and many of their best players have not had much international experience.  One of their best pitchers is only nineteen years old.The ACT side included Australian national team members Aimee Murch and Clare Warwick; Olympic bronze medalist Brenda De Blaes; Victorian state team representative, national team member and Olympic bronze medalist Justine Smethurst; and Clare Currie, who narrowly missed the cut for the national team.De Blaes started the top of the first with a hit.  She ended the inning stranded on base.  Murch was pitching for the ACT to start the bottom of the first. Number 15 for Japan opened the inning with a single, and was advanced to third on another single.  She was tagged out after trying to score a run after her teammate hit a pop up caught by the ACT's centre fielder. Number 6 hit a double during this inning, scoring Japan's only run.  The top of the second saw ACT players 1, 5 and 3 tagged out after hits to the infield.

The bottom of the third saw Japan's first batter ground out, number 8 getting a single on an infield hit, another playing getting an out, and the inning ending with number 11 hitting an infield ground out.The rest of the game followed much the same pattern.  Two players, an ACT player and a Japanese, were struck by balls and required trainers to look at them. Smethurst came in and pitched a few innings in relief.  Between the fifth and sixth innings, there was a small delay in the game when a dog named Streaker, owned by Australia men's national softball team player Adam Folkard, ran onto the the infield.  The game ended 1–0.

In the ACT's half of the inning, they went scoreless with only Jessie Baine getting on base as a result of a walk. The ACT had at least two errors, and the score was 6-0.The ACT left Parnaby in for the start of the third, where the first Japanese batter Yumi Iwabuchi hit a single to left field, Mari Souma getting struck out and Yamada hitting a double to outfield.  At this point, the ACT made a pitching change, bringing in national team pitcher Aimee Murch where there was at least one fielding error by Clare Warwick and additional hits by the Japanese that allowed them to score another two runs before the third out was recorded on a fly ball by Fujino.  The ACT's three batters in their half of the inning, including Ashleigh Eldridge and De Blaes, hit balls caught by Japanese fielders.

Nikki Pallister then hit a fly ball caught by Japan and turned into a double play to end the inning with a score of 10-0 Japan.The game officially ended at this point but because this was a training match, it was continued to allow players extra time to train and gain more experience.

In 210 days, she traveled by herself for over 23,000 nautical miles on a 34-foot (10.4m) yacht, called Ella's Pink Lady. Watson completed her journey days before her seventeenth birthday.When Watson neared land, a large assortment of other watercraft began to parade alongside her yacht. She was greeted by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who called her "Australia's newest hero." However, Watson disagreed with the comment, saying, "I don't consider myself a hero." Rudd also congratulated her with a free driving lesson and a copy of the Australian "Keys to Drive" program.Prior to her voyage, Watson caught some criticism when she first announced her intention to sail solo around the world. Some thought that she was too young and too inexperienced to safely travel alone, but Watson's mother stated that she had been sailing since she was eight years old. Last week, it was questioned whether Watson had sailed far enough past the Equator to satisfy the requirements for achieving the record. Watson's record is unofficial because the World Speed Sailing Record Council no longer has a category for the sailors under eighteen. Jesse Martin, also Australian, held the previous record in 1999, when he was eighteen.After a blowout win for the New York Yankees on Sunday, their ancient rivalry with the 2004 World Series champion Boston Red Sox resumed with a close game on Tuesday that went down to the wire.

The victory  earned Johnson 190 points (including a 5 point bonus), moving him closer to point leader Kevin Harvick, but he is still 105 points behind in second position.  With eight laps remaining, Kurt Busch, who was running second, bumped Johnson to become the leader, but Johnson returned the favor a couple laps later to the lead the final two laps. Johnson said, “Kurt knocked me out of the way. At that point, I thought, I don’t care if I win or finish. I’m going to run into him one way or the other ... I tried once and moved him. (I thought) I’ve got to hit him harder. The second time I did and moved him out of the way.” Tony Stewart finished in the second position, ahead of Kurt Busch and Jeff Gordon in third and fourth. Ryan Newman, Clint Bowyer, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Joey Logano and A. J. Allmendinger rounded out the top ten positions. The race had total of four cautions and sixteen lead changes among nine different drivers. Kasey Kahne led the most laps by leading 110.

The title tied him with Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt for the most in Cup Series history.Although he qualified 14th, a ruling of illegal modifications to his car required him to start the race at the back of the field of 40 cars. Meanwhile, fellow Chase for the Sprint Cup contenders Kyle Busch, Carl Edwards and Joey Logano qualified 9th, 10th and 13th, respectively. Pole position winner Kevin Harvick led the first 31 laps; Kyle Larson led the race high of 132 laps. Despite his last-place start, Johnson was able to reach the top five in less than 50 laps. However, Johnson remained behind his three championship rivals.The race featured seven caution periods, six different leaders and 20 lead changes. The first caution came when Ryan Blaney hit the wall on lap 28; he would be involved in another caution on lap 208. Jeffrey Earnhardt spun on lap 81, while the third caution of the night came for debris on lap 172.On a restart with ten laps to go, Edwards collided with Logano while attempting to block him. The resulting crash collected Brad Keselowski, Ryan Newman, Kasey Kahne, Ty Dillon, Chase Elliott, Regan Smith and Martin Truex Jr., whose car caught fire after hitting Keselowski. Logano received minimal damage in the contact with Edwards and was able to continue.With less than four laps left, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. hit the wall, resulting in an overtime finish, which extended the race length to 268 laps. Johnson took the lead from Larson with three laps to go and held on to win his 80th Cup race and the championship.Johnson commented, "It's just beyond words [...] We just kept our heads in the game. Chad called a great strategy, made some great adjustments for the short runs. Luck came our way and we were able to win the race and win the championship."Larson finished second, followed by Harvick, Logano and Jamie McMurray. With his fourth-place finish, Logano finished second in the points standings with 5,037 points, three fewer than Johnson; Busch, sixth in this race, and Edwards, 34th, finished third and fourth in the standings with 5,035 and 5,007 points, respectively.The championship was Johnson's first since 2013, and at the age of 41, he became the youngest driver to win seven titles. Prior to 2013, he won five straight championships from 2006 to 2010.The race also marked the final Cup start for three-time champion Tony Stewart, who finished 22nd. Stewart congratulated Johnson in victory lane and Johnson gave Stewart his helmet as a gift.The 38 game hitting streak of Jimmy Rollins has ended. The streak begain on August 23, 2005. After two games into the 2006 regular season, he went 0-4 in a 4-2 loss against St.Louis, promptly ending his pursuit of the impressive record 56 game feat accomplished by Joe Dimaggio in 1941.  Another record that Rollins' was chasing has been largely overlooked. The National League hit streak record shared by Pete Rose(1978) and Willie Keeler(1897) was 44 games, just 6 more than Rollins' accomplished.The streak was not without controversy.  Many contested that the streak should not count due to the fact that it spanned two seasons.  The major league marks for longest hitting streak in one season and longest hitting streak spanning two seasons are separate records.  For example, Willie Keeler's hitting streak was accomplished in one season in 1897.  He also had a hit in the last game in 1896, making his  streak 45 over two seasons.  Others believed that the streak was more difficult since Rollins had to wait six months before trying to start again. "I think it will be almost a little bit more special if he ends up going as far because of the layoff," Cardinals shortstop David Eckstein said before the streak ended.On Sunday, Team Penske driver Joey Logano claimed his first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series win of the 2016 season in the FireKeepers Casino 400 at the Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Michigan. The 200-lap race began with Logano starting from the pole position, and featured nine cautions and fourteen lead changes between eight different drivers. Despite starting first, Logano was quickly overtaken on the first lap by Furniture Row Racing driver Martin Truex Jr. Truex led the race until Logano reclaimed the first position on lap ten, a position he would keep until the the first cycle of green flag pit stops around lap 40. Logano's teammate Brad Keselowski took the lead during the pit stop cycle by staying out on the track. Keselowski, low on gasoline, led until a caution came out for a spin by Truex around lap 46. During the caution, Keselowski pitted and returned the lead back to his teammate, who led the race until lap 93. Two other cautions slowed the race between the first caution and lap 93. The first occurred when Kyle Busch's engine failed around lap 53, forcing the driver to a last-place finish in the race. The other caution was caused by contact between the cars of Chris Buescher, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and A. J. Allmendinger ten laps later. Between laps 93 and 103, Kyle Larson, Ryan Newman, Keselowski, Jimmie Johnson, and Paul Menard led at least one lap. Logano returned to the lead on lap 104, a few laps before a caution when Jeffrey Earnhardt's car caught fire. After the caution, Logano remained in first until Hendrick Motorsports driver Chase Elliott passed him on lap 117. Elliott kept the lead until lap 149, when he was briefly passed by Logano. Elliott retook the lead for three more laps on lap 150 before returning the lead back to Logano, who led until the seventh caution was called around lap 156 for of a collision between Danica Patrick, Brian Scott, and Casey Mears. Logano held the lead on the ensuing restart and led through two more caution periods that were called in the final 50 laps. The first began around lap 164 because of a collision involving Johnson, Trevor Bayne, and Ryan Blaney, while the final caution of the race was called with about ten laps remaining after Denny Hamlin suffered a tire puncture on the front straightaway and collided into the SAFER barrier. On the final restart, Logano retained the first position and led the remainder of the race to capture the fifteenth win of his career. After the race, Logano, who led a race-high of 138 laps, praised his team, saying "Team Penske gave me a great race car. Everyone did a great job figuring out exactly what this car was going to do. This is Ford's backyard, Roger [Penske]'s backyard; this is a great win". Elliott, who finished second in the race, expressed disappointment with his result, claiming he "messed up" by not using the correct gear. Larson, Keselowski, and Kevin Harvick completed the top-five finishers, while Carl Edwards finished in the sixth position. Tony Stewart finished seventh ahead of Austin Dillon and Jamie McMurray, who finished eighth and ninth. Kurt Busch completed the first ten positions with a tenth-place finish. In post-race inspection, Larson's car did not pass laser inspection, prompting NASCAR to impound his car so it can be further evaluated. Any possible penalties are to be announced in the next week. In the drivers' championship, Harvick led Kurt Busch and Keselowski with 526 points. Edwards and Logano were fourth and fifth with 472 and 455 points. Elliott was sixth with 453, followed by Johnson with 441. Truex was scored eighth ahead of Kyle Busch and Matt Kenseth, who completed the top-ten.

Instead of his grandmother a resident of New Zealand, it was in fact his great-grandmother. According to Rugby League International Federation chairman Colin Love, the Kiwis thought great-grandparents were as good as grandparents.For a player to play for a different team other than their birth place the rules say that then their parents and/or grandparents have to be born in the other country.The two points which were docked were the ones that the Kiwis earned when they beat Great Britain last week, it was the same game in which Fien was hooker for the Kiwis team.The Tri-Nations subcommittee who made the decision didn't want to kick the Kiwis out of the competition.The penalty incurred has put the Kiwis team into last place with zero points, alongside another team, the Lions. The Kiwis are now not going to be able to qualify for the final on November 25.The Kiwis last game is against Great Britain on Saturday.Fien has reportedly left the Kiwis training camp and is reportedly heading back to Townsville.EliteXC Lightweight champion K.J. Noons was stripped of the title on Friday by EliteXC officials for failure to defend the title. Outlined in a press release, EliteXC Head of Fight Operations, Jeremy Lappen stated that Noons turned down two opportunities to defend the title against top contender Nick Diaz. "It's a very unfortunate situation but we cannot have belt-holders who refuse to fight the top contenders," Lappen said in the release. "We want champions who will fight anyone, anytime, anyplace. That's the mentality all champions should have." In June 2008 Noons reportedly turned down an opportunity to defend the title against Diaz in a rematch as the main event on the October 4 EliteXC show on CBS Sports. In August 2008, Noons again turned down an opportunity to fight Diaz for the belt on a future ShoXC card on Showtime Networks. "From my view, it is a fight against a top-named opponent in Diaz," Lappen went on to say, "a fighter KJ has bad blood with and a fight the fans really wanted to see. It seemed like a great opportunity for KJ to me."K.J. Noons won the EliteXC Lightweight Championship on November 10, 2007 after the fight was stopped in the first round due to a cut over the eye of then-champion Nick Diaz. Noons has since successfully defended the title against veteran fighter Yves Edwards after Edwards was pummeled into a TKO 48 seconds into the first round. In an interview with Sherdog.com on August 29, however, Noons contends that the issue isn't over not wanting the rematch, but compensation by EliteXC. "I always wanted to fight Nick Diaz," Noons told reporter Loretta Hunt.  "It's the most marketable fight for me, the best style fight for me. I think the fans want to see it. But you have to pay for something you want to see." Noons went on to explain that he took exception with the fact while he made $84,000 in the last two years, Diaz was paid $60,000 to take on lower-ranked opponent Thomas Denny on July 26. "It is about the money and how they were paying somebody I already beat three times more."The future of K.J. Noons in EliteXC is uncertain. "KJ has two more fights remaining on his contract," said Jeremy Lappen, "We are still looking forward to having him fight for us again soon, but not as our world champion." However, recent public finding have revealed that EliteXC is $55 million in debt. Whether or not they can pay out the remainder of Noons' contract remains to be seen. Nonetheless, Noons is determined to continue on. "I can guarantee you that for MMA, I won't be sitting on the sidelines," he said. "I want to continue with my dream of pursuing two sports." EliteXC is expected to announce a fight for the vacant Lightweight title in the near future.Konami Cup Asia Series 2007 battled in Tokyo Dome today, with 2007 BWC in Taiwan and upcoming 2007 Asian Baseball Championship chained on the qualification of 2008 Summer Olympics, this series may varied Asian's teams recently.On Sunday, female ice hockey players from North and South Korea joined one another for a training session before the upcoming Winter Olympics. Players from the two Koreas are to compete together as a united team for the events hosted in Pyeongchang, South Korea, which are scheduled to start on February 9; Seoul's Unification Ministry said. The cross-border gesture is part of diplomatic efforts to ease tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula and the team was approved by the International Olympic Committee.The International Olympic Committee selected Pyeongchang in 2011 to host the event, marking South Korea's first opportunity since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The earlier event was marred by violence as North Korea had bombed a South Korean flight several months prior, killing over 100 and boycotted the event. Inter-Korean relations have changed considerably in the ensuing thirty years, including the two sending unified teams for table tennis and youth football in other non-Olympic competitions.The announcement that the two countries would compete together was a stated goal of South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Last year, he announced the proposal and the two nations went into discussion this month. After two weeks, they made the announcement to field a consolidated 35-strong team of ice hockey players and have joint skiing exercises with both team coaches involved.According to Yonhap News Agency estimates, about 80% of South Koreans support dialogue, but the move to have a joint team has been controversial. Over 10,000 South Korean citizens sent a petition to South Korean President Moon opposing the union and a group of North Korean defectors held a protest at the South Korean National Assembly on January 24, tearing apart photos of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Public support for eventual reunification of the Korean peninsula has waned in recent years, with the younger generation more skeptical of the possibility.Libby Kosmala’s selection in the Australian shooting team for the 2012 London Paralympics highlights age is not a barrier in the Paralympics. Celebrating her seventieth birthday in early July, expected to set a record for most appearances at her eleventh Games, Kosmala is likely to be the oldest athlete in attendance.Her first Games were the 1972 Heidelberg Games competing in swimming and athletics events and winning a bronze medal in the mixed medley relay. Kosmala then switched to shooting and between 1976–1988  won nine gold and three silver medals. At the 2008 Beijing Games she narrowly missed a medal, coming fourth in the Women's Air Rifle Standing SH1. In 2011 at the IPC Shooting World Cup, her level of competitiveness was highlighted by finishing fifth in the final of the Women’s 10m Air Rifle Standing SH1. Kosmala is looking forward to the London Games saying: "It's very exciting. I'm looking forward to it. In over ten Paralympic Games, my greatest success was at Stoke  Mandeville in 1984, so I'm looking forward to competing in London again for Australia".Kosmala loves beating athletes half her age: "Competition brings out the best in you. I'm old enough to be their grandmother for a lot of the players, but they really are lovely".  Kosmala’s training involves physical training, three shooting sessions per week and mental relaxation training. The London Games will  be her swansong but she will still keep shooting. She puts her longevity down to steadiness and a keen eye. Ashley Adams is to join her on the shooting team, attending his fourth Games, as will newcomers Luke Cain, Jason Maroney and Bradley Mark. Russell Short, a vision-impaired thrower and the Australian Institute of Sport's first athlete with a disability scholarship, in 1988, has been selected for his seventh Games. Another athlete likely to attend his seventh Games is Kieran Modra, a vision impaired cyclist. Selections for the cycling team are yet to be confirmed.Two athletes who extended their Paralympic careers by changing sports have been selected; Greg Smith, who previously took part in track and field events, will be competing in wheelchair rugby. This is to be his fifth Games. Liesl Tesch, a former Australian wheelchair basketball player and captain, will be competing in sailing for her sixth Games.Contrasting Australian Paralympians with their Olympian counterparts, the Australian Olympic Committee recently selected sporting shooters Russell Mark and Michael Diamond for the London Games; this to be their sixth Olympics and equalling the participation records of rower James Tomkins, sailor Colin Beashel, and equestrian Andrew Hoy.Professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) announced last night during their No Surrender Pay-Per-View event that Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle has signed an exclusive contract with the company.

TNA also used the Pay-Per-View to announce that the weekly television show TNA Impact will be moving from it's current timeslot of Thursdays at 11PM, to 9PM, starting November 16.Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) is an American professional wrestling promotion, founded by Jeff Jarrett and his father Jerry Jarrett in May 2002 and now owned by Panda Energy International. The company, which trades as TNA Entertainment, LLC, operates out of Nashville, Tennessee, with an office in Orlando, Florida.File:Donald Sterling.jpgLos Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has received a lifetime ban from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and has been fined $US2.5million for his racist comments this week. Sterling, who has owned the team since 1981, was overheard telling a woman, identified as girlfriend V. Stiviano, not to bring black people to games or associate with them.The comments have caused an uproar, not just in the NBA, but within the Clippers team. In protest, players wore their warm-up jerseys inside out before their Game 4 playoff loss against the Golden State Warriors, while in other games throughout the league the San Antonio Spurs played in black socks and the Miami Heat practiced with their warm-up shirts inside out to mimic the LA Clippers.Former NBA player Kevin Johnson, now mayor of Sacramento, said the league needed to hand out the maximum possible penalty. While NBA legend Michael Jordan, owner of the Charlotte Bobcats said there is no room in the NBA, or anywhere, for this kind of hatred.The conversation took place on April 9, when a man's voice, later identified as Sterling's, told the woman not to pose for photos with black men, including Hall of Famer Ervin "Magic" Johnson. Sterling goes onto say it annoys him that she has to promote her association with black people.It isn't the first time Sterling has caused controversy with racist comments. Back in 2009 he was sued by his former General Manager Elgin Baylor who criticised Sterling's attitude and quoted him as saying "I'm offering you good money for a poor black kid" when negotiating a contract with Danny Manning.The situation is far from over as Sterling is refusing to sell the team, and the other teams have lobbied against him to force him to sell. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver needs 75% support, or 23 out of the 30 teams, to force Sterling out of the league permanently.  "The fine will be donated to organisations dedicated to anti-discrimination and tolerance efforts that will be jointly selected by the NBA and the Players' Association" Mr Silver said.A proposed players' strike could postpone the start of La Liga, the top professional association football division of the Spanish football league system.Spanish football functionaries and players will hold last minute talks on Friday to avert a strike that could see the start of the Spanish football season postponed. If the talks fail, the strike would be first strike of its kind since 1984. The strike was called due to the growing issue of unpaid wages. The disagreement rises from Spain's bankruptcy laws, which allow for the payment of wages to be delayed like any other debt. Six teams in Spain's top flight are currently bankrupt and owe over 200 players close to US$72 million.Spain's footballers will go on strike from Friday to Monday, canceling the start of both the first and second divisions. Top clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid will be the high profile casualties of this postponement. There has been almost universal support for the strike with coaches and players of many clubs supporting the strike. Barcelona forward David Villa said: "We have made clear that all the players support the players' association, if a solution is not found, we won't play." When Mallorca coach Michael Laudrup was asked to comment, he made his stance clear by saying "I think it's ok what the players are doing now," pointing to the discrepancies between the riches of Barcelona, Real Madrid and the rest of Spanish football.Espanyol captain Luis García told El Mundo Deportivo on Thursday that the time for all the players to unite had come and enough is enough. "We aren't asking for more money - only that the contracts that have been signed are fulfilled. Either this is resolved once and for all or we don't play. We cannot continue like this," he added. Hércules striker Tote echoed the players' position: "If necessary, there will be no football in Spain throughout the whole year. If we have to maintain our stance until May, we will."Real Zaragoza striker Ikechukwu Uche told the BBC's African sports programme Fast Track: "Not all the players are owed, but there is solidarity. I don't think the strike is good for anybody - it's not good for us, it's not good for the federation, it's not good for the fans. We had expected that we were going to start [the league] this weekend but we can't - they have to resolve the issues. Once they have resolved everything, then we will start."Further talks are expected to take place on Saturday and Monday.Philipp Lahm has agreed to terms on a three-year extension to his current contract with newly crowned German champions Bayern Munich which will keep him in Munich until June 30, 2012."I'm delighted about it, otherwise I wouldn't have done it,“ Lahm commented before of a final pre-match training session today. Talks with the board and incoming coach Jürgen Klinsmann in recent weeks had been "very productive. I sense a real new beginning here, and that's what persuaded me,“ he told the respected Süddeutsche Zeitung.Bayern Munich have withdrawen their contract offer to Philipp Lahm after contract talks between the club and player broke down. Lahm's contract as it currently stands will expire on June 30, 2009. Barcelona are one of the clubs that are reportly interested in Lahm.Bayern Munich Forward Jan Schlaudraff will be leaving for Hannover on July 1st when the summer transfer window opens. It is uncertain if there is any fee involved with this transfer.Schlaudraff never got going due to an early season injury and the fact that he was the 4th choice strike behind Luca Toni, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski.The French cycling newspaper L'Équipe is reporting that a drugs testing laboratory has discovered that Lance Armstrong, seven times winner of the Tour de France, used the banned substance EPO in the 1999 tour - his first victory after defeating testicular cancer. L'Equipe also points out that the results may tarnish Armstrong's image forever, and cast a shadow of doubt over his six other victories.Lance Armstrong has responded on his website, branding L'Equipe's reporting of being "nothing short of tabloid journalism." Armstrong says: "I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance[-]enhancing drugs."The Châtenay-Malabry French national doping screening laboratory, which developed the first EPO tests, says it has been developing new experimental detection techniques and decided to test frozen urine samples taken from Armstrong after several stages of the 1999 tour. The director of the official French anti-doping test laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry, Jacques de Ceaurriz [1] was quoted as saying he had "no doubt about the validity of our results." [2]  He said that while being kept for long periods can cause EPO proteins to deteriorate, this would possibly result in negative tests for doped athletes, but not false positives. It should be pointed out that technically this statement is false.  EPO is naturally produced in the body.  It is present at low levels in normal human urine, and natural levels in a human doing high-altitude training (a known "trick" of Mr. Armstrong) could be unusually high.  Therefore, false positives can be obtained by setting the sensitivity threshold too low.  This is especially true if the number of control samples (for calibration purposes) is limited, as is the case with the 1999 urine samples.  These calibration issues are a reason EPO wasn't officially tested for earlier.  Incidentally, de Ceaurriz stated that his laboratory worked on numbered anonymous samples, and was unaware when he sent his results to WADA/AMA that some of the results concerned Lance Armstrong.In addition to these accusations, and in response to them, Armstrong has also received open backing from US Cycling [3], individual cycling officials [4], from former Tour winners Eddy Merckx and Miguel Indurain [5], and other public figures.Supporters argue numerous irregularities in the doping claim: "' Wada (World Anti-Doping Agency) and the US Anti-Doping Agency, they've all defined a process for collecting samples, managing samples, testing the samples, identifying the people who are involved,' said Johnson. ' They have certain rights in the process. None of that has been followed in this case.' Officials from cycling's ruling body (UCI), Wada, the French sports ministry and the Tour de France all agree normal anti-doping proceedings have not been followed. ' This isn't a 'doping positive. This is just a publication in a French tabloid newspaper. That's our perspective,'" added Johnson.'"--BBC These allegations are still under examination by a number of news and anti-doping organizations.  UCI StatementOn September 9, after a period of investigation, the UCI finally released a strongly-worded official statement condemning the WADA, the French laboratory in question, and the paper L'Equipe, for having failed to provide any official communication, and having failed to provide any data, evidence, or background on the allegations. The UCI stated that it was still "awaiting plausible answers" to its requests to WADA and the laboratory, but also indicated "We deplore the fact that the long-established and entrenched confidentiality principle could be violated in such a flagrant way without any respect for fair play and the rider's privacy." [6]The accusers themselves, in particular the World Anti-Doping Agency, might face an investigation into their own practices, in connection to their allegations against Armstrong. The UCI stated "We have substantial concerns about the impact of this matter on the integrity of the overall drug testing regime of the Olympic movement, and in particular the questions it raises over the trustworthiness of some of the sports and political authorities active in the anti-doping fight." On October 5, the UCI announced the appointment of an independent expert to investigate the leaking of doping allegations against Armstrong: "French sports newspaper L'Equipe claims that samples given by the American icon on the 1999 Tour later tested positive. Armstrong has denied the allegations. The International Cycling Union (UCI) has now appointed Dutch lawyer and doping specialist Emile Vrijman to probe how the details were released. The UCI said it 'expects all relevant parties to fully co-operate'. Vrijman is a former director of the National Anti-Doping Agency in the Netherlands (NeCeDo)." [7]Accused of EPO doping by the French cycling daily L'Équipe in a four page story on Aug. 23, cyclist Lance Armstrong appeared on CNN's Larry King Live TV show Aug. 25, saying he did not trust the French testers or the French testing system, and that his urine was manipulated to falsely accuse him of doping.Dr. Christiane Ayotte, director of a Montreal doping detection laboratory said that ethically critical and important scientific questions were raised by the EPO doping allegation against seven-time Tour de France winner Armstrong. USA Cycling official Gerard Bisceglia said these L'Équipe charges were unfair and lacked credibility. Bisceglia is chief executive of USA Cycling, principal authority over Armstrong for cycling sports in the United States.L'Équipe released Paris lab data allegedly finding banned EPO in five year old samples of Armstrong's urine, originally taken after he won the 1999 Tour de France. No official source would confirm medical identification of Armstrong as provider of the anonymously tested urine, and to do so would be a violation of World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) regulations.  Armstrong suggested motivation for such manipulation is a French national hatred of all non-French sport winners, and specifically because a French rider has not won the Tour de France for a quarter century. As evidence of malice toward him, Armstrong cited a French newspaper poll in which he was named the third most hated sportsman in France. Dr. Ayotte is Doping Control director at Canada's Institut National de la Recherché Scientifique in Montreal, which is a WADA certified lab nearest to WADA's Montreal headquarters. Ayotte is also a world class scientific authority and instructor on sports doping detection. Dr. Ayotte's expert opinion has significant influence on the outcome of WADA regulatory decisions. L'Équipe reported that the EPO detection method used was experimental, which raises a scientific question. All experimentally based forensic evidence is subject to the close scrutiny of scientific opinions before it can be used in a disciplinary or legal proceeding. Ayotte expressed surprise that chemical testing of 1999 urine could have been done in 2004 at the French national anti-doping laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry. She said that she routinely instructs all doping laboratory organizations, that previously detectable EPO protein deteriorates and disappears after two or three months, even if the urine is frozen. Ayotte thinks that a new statistical mathematics model was used to reanalyze numerical data resulting from earlier chemical testing. "My interpretation is that retesting itself must have been conducted in 2000 or in 2001, but the results were reviewed using the new mathematical model that is now being developed in Paris."Ayotte does not question whether the new type of analysis is correct; rather she questions the ethics of long-delayed test results. The first ethical problem is that this adverse finding cannot be confirmed with second samples. There are normally available two urine samples, "A" and "B". The Châtenay-Malabry EPO findings were based on Armstrong's "B" samples. Armstrong's "A" samples were depleted in 1999 for tests that did not include EPO, because no EPO test was available that year. Without addressing the ethics problem, Dick Pound, the head of WADA, said. "You can count on the fingers of one hand the times a "B" sample has not confirmed the result of the "A" sample".Both France and USA officials observed that L'Équipe's unofficial adverse finding was not consistent with WADA regulations. French Sports Minister Jean-François Lamour said that without the "A" samples, no disciplinary action could be taken against Armstrong. USA official Bisceglia confirmed that WADA regulations require a confirming "A" test to prove guilt.The second ethical problem, according to Ayotte, is that an athlete charged with doping long after the athletic event, has no way to submit to additional testing to disprove an adverse finding. This same ethical problem was also stated by USA official Bisceglia. The third ethical problem for Ayotte is that L'Équipe disclosed Armstrong's medical identity. "It seems to me," Ayotte continued, "that this whole thing is breach of the WADA code. We are supposed to work confidentially until such time that we can confirm a result. By no means does this mean that we sweep a result under the carpet, but it has to meet a certain set of requirements." In a further ethical complication, the medical identification of Armstrong is completely unofficial and is made only by L'Équipe. Ayotte characterized the disclosure as "leaked". Châtenay-Malabry's lab refused to confirm L'Équipe's claim that the urine samples belonged to Armstrong. Nor is it likely that Châtenay-Malabry will ever identify Armstrong, because WADA regulations require that all single "B" samples used for experimental testing must remain permanently anonymous. Ayotte said, "I'm worried, because I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in Paris. I am concerned that they did not cover their backs before being dragged into a very public issue of this kind." Lance Armstrong has responded on his LanceArmstrong.com website, branding L'Équipe's reporting as being "nothing short of tabloid journalism." Armstrong says: "I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs."Further confusing public understanding of the EPO doping claim is  Armstrong's statement in his autobiography, It's Not About the Bike: he said he received EPO during his cancer chemotherapy treatment. "It was the only thing that kept me alive," he wrote. Armstrong last received chemotherapy EPO in late 1996. Apparently speaking from his knowledge of conventional EPO testing, Armstrong agrees that traces of 1996 synthetic EPO should not have been present in his 1999 urine. There are now tests to distinguish natural from synthetic EPO. But it remains an unresearched scientific question whether the sensitivity of the experimental new method could detect use of synthetic EPO from three years previously. By scientific analogy, the polymerase chain reaction process can detect as little as a single molecule of DNA. Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, said that Armstrong owes cycling fans an explanation. Armstrong subsequently provided an explanation claiming urine test manipulation.Leblanc also said; "For the first time—and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts—someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body." "When people start using comments like, 'irrefutable scientific evidence,' that's a pretty strong statement to make," said Bisceglia, "when the person you're making it about has never been given the opportunity to refute the statement. You're making claims about something that took place in 1999. Based on what I've read, it's pretty clear that any opportunity to have a black-and-white resolution to this case has been destroyed."Bisceglia said that USA Cycling, the governing body in the United States, lacks the officially required evidence, and therefore will not investigate the L'Équipe report.Lance Armstrong, seven-time Tour de France champion and partner of singer Sheryl Crow, has criticized Tour director Jean-Marie LeBlanc for his comments that next year's race will be more exciting without him. LeBlanc said Thursday, "It is a change of era. A period of long domination is over. The path is open. It is an exciting time."On Saturday night, Armstrong hosted NBC's satirical TV show Saturday Night Live, making light of the allegations.  During the opening of the show, Armstrong said: "The last time I did something too good, the French started testing my urine every 15 minutes!" Armstrong's Fiancee, Sheryl Crow, also appeared on the show.United States sportsman Lance Armstrong today won the international cycling competition Tour de France. This is the seventh consecutive win for Armstrong. It is also his last, as Armstrong announced prior to the race that he will be retiring from professional cycling after the competition.The last leg was an 89.8-mile strecth from Corbeil-Essonnes to Paris' famed Champs-Elysees. But poor weather conditions affected the finale.The official race time clock was stopped when the riders reached the Champs Elysee due to rain making the famous cobble stones slippery. However, the rain stopped and the stones dried during the eight final laps of the famous road, and time-bonuses were awarded for the stage win. Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan, riding for T-Mobile, won the stage after his break-away from the field 1,500m out could not be reeled in by the peloton, relegating the sprinters to lower placings. The 20s time bonus moved Vinokurov to fifth overall in the race.As Armstrong was presented the final Yellow Jersey, he was quoted in the press as saying in a mixture of French and English, "Vive le Tour, forever." The winning Yellow Jersey is awarded to the cyclist who had the best overall performance throughout the tour's circuit.After the awards ceremony, Armstrong discussed what comes next in his life, mentioning that defeating cancer by raising awareness and funds is his new goal."We know how to train and prepare for the Tour," he says. "If we win, it is a success. Cancer is not and will not be that way. It is a different kind of fight. It's not something that lasts three weeks."Along the way there will be victories and defeats. There are going to be survivors and people who aren't going to make it. My goal and my responsibility is to make sure that we don't forget ... how devastating cancer has been. I can help change that.""I sit here as a person who considers myself totally cured," he says. "But one of those people who was along the side of the road over the last three weeks might have breast cancer and might die in three months."How can they not be cured? The illness is complicated; there are hundreds of different illnesses and cell types, little bastards inside who don't agree with what we throw at them, who don't want to die."Armstrong has been a member of the President's Cancer Panel since 2002.  He feels that his role is to get the funds to keep that research alive, saying that "we have the smartest people in the world" already working on cures."Funding is tough to come by these days," he says. "The biggest downside to a war in Iraq is what you could do with that money. What does a war in Iraq cost a week? A billion? Maybe a billion a day? The budget for the National Cancer Institute is four billion. That has to change. It needs to become a priority again."Polls say people are much more afraid of cancer than of a plane flying into their house or a bomb or any other form of terrorism. It is a priority for the American public."MADRID, Spain — Floyd Landis requested the testing of his backup urine sample today."We've sent the fax to the UCI this afternoon." "Now we'll have to adjust to their calendar," said Jose Maria Buxeda, one of Landis's two Spanish lawyers, of the Swiss-based International Cycling Union. Landis's lawyers say they fully expect the backup test to confirm the original finding.Oscar Pereiro of Spain, who finished second overall in the Tour de France, would be declared the winner if Landis loses the title.Results will be revealed during the week.Floyd Landis , who came in first in the 2006 Tour de France, has tested positive for abnormal ratio of testosterone/epitestosterone, the Phonak team said on their website. Landis' "A" sample, taken after Stage 17 was positive, and his place on the Phonak team will be based on the lab results of the "B" sample.This statement by the Phonak team came after yesterday's statement from the UCI that an unidentified cyclist had failed a drug test during the tour. Landis has been suspended by the Phonak team, and if he fails the second set of tests, he will be fired and could be stripped of the Tour title. Under regulations set by the World Anti-Doping agency, a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone greater than 4:1 is considered a positive result and subject to an investigation.  Until recently the cutoff was at 6:1. The natural ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone is generally about 1:1.On Monday, the result of a counter-analysis of Floyd Landis' B-sample, as requested by the Americans, will be announced.Landis, who came in first on this year’s Tour de France, has previously tested positive for an abnormally high testosterone balance in his blood stream.  This led to claims that he was involved with doping, in order to improve performance.According to Patrick Lefévère, the president of the Association of professional cycling teams, "Our sport's survival is at stake"..."We can no longer afford to have teams or riders who just won't learn still starting races."Landis continues to deny any wrongdoing."I want the result to be made public immediately, I see no reason why not," Landis said. "I'm proud that I won the Tour because I was the strongest guy there"Manchester United progressed to the quarterfinals of the Champions League earlier today after defeating Lille 1-0 for the second time.  After the controversial winning goal from the first leg, United had a strong advantage in the series, and Lille needed a win to advance.  The scorer of that controversial goal, Ryan Giggs, was left out of the lineup, and instead the more defensive minded John O'Shea was played.  Lille started the game with a defensive lineup as well, hoping to stall the Red Devils, and make a score later in the match.  Manchester United came into the game short of several key players due to injury, including Louis Saha (hamstring), Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer (surgery recovery), and Darren Fletcher (ankle).  Striker Alan Smith was on the bench for United hoping to get back to first team action after a broken leg kept him out of the main squad for nearly a year.United grabbed the first of the chances 15 minutes into the game after Scholes popped in a cross to Rooney, but the young striker couldn't get his volley away in time, and Mathieu Chalme moved well to block.  The ensuing corner saw another good chance present itself for United, but John O'Shea's powerful headed from Carrick's kick hit only the crossbar.  Lille then had a chance of their own as Makoun strafed in behind the defence to connect with a freekick by Obraniak.  Makoun's header was poor, and keeper Edwin Van Der Sar had and easy time collecting the ball.  When Macnhester United earned themselves a freekick outside the Lille area, two Lille players placed themselves directly in front of Paul Scholes, not allowing him to take an early kick.  Lille was appearing to be playing stronger, and made quick moves on the counter attack to worry United.  One fine pass by Chalme into the box was aimed for a wide open Odemwingie, but he was not able to cleanly hit the ball, and the danger passed. Cristiano Ronaldo made his presence felt in the Lille area and was brought down by Chalme in the box.  Instead of a penalty, Ronaldo was awarded a yellow card for what referee Luis Cantalejo considered a dive.The second half saw Lille continue to dominate the football match, and the first threat came through a long range shot by Keita, but Van Der Sar saved well.  Odemwingie was again on the attack, but was unfortunate to see his header smash off the post.  United finally had a chance of their own in the second half when defender Nemanja Vidic connected with a free kick by Rooney, but the Serbian's header flew just over the goal.  A sense of anxiety was starting to fill Old Trafford until Ronaldo and Larsson combined to put the series away after 72 minutes.  Ronaldo used some of his trademark moves to outwit 3 Lille defenders and knocked a well aimed ball into Larsson, who forced a powerful header into the back of the net.  The goal will be the last Larsson will score for United at Old Trafford, as his loan contract expires on the 12th of March.  Larsson was applauded as he left the pitch and was replaced by Alan Smith, who was eager to impress after his extended absence from the team.  Lille made two changes of their own, throwing Fauvergue and Mirallis into the fray, but they never looked likely to get the two goals they needed to advance.  United went on to win, but now have even more injury worries as Mikael Silvestre had to be stretchered off the field after sustaining a head injury.Argentine footballer Francisco Varallo has died at the age of 100. Varallo was the last surviving participant of the first FIFA World Cup in 1930. His death was confirmed by his former Argentine club Gimnasia y Esgrima. The cause of death was not announced.Varallo played for the Argentine national team and appeared at the 1930 FIFA World Cup in Uruguay. He played in the final match in which Argentina lost 4-2 against the host nation. During celebrations for his 100th birthday Varallo spoke about the tournament. He said "In my whole life I've never felt such a bitter pain as losing that World Cup final against Uruguay in 1930. We ran out of steam, to tell you the truth, with all due respect to my teammates, we weren't gutsy enough. How I cried that day. Even now when I look back it still makes me angry." After the World Cup he played for Argentine teams Gimnasia y Esgrima and Boca Juniors. While at Boca Juniors he held the record for most goals scored at 194. He held this record until current striker Martin Palermo overtook his record. FIFA President Sepp Blatter released a statment about Varallo's death. He said "In these grief-filled moments I can take immense pride from the fact that a character such as Francisco Varallo, whom we shall never forget, represented the football family with such dignity".Toronto FC signed midfielder Laurent Robert after Derby County freed him of his contractual obligations. details of the contract were not released per team and league policy.  We are thrilled to have Laurent join Toronto FC and become part of our club. He's a tremendous player with a lot of talent and we expect him to come in and make an impact with our team straight away. He's played at every level, and is a true professional in every respect. – Mo Johnston, General ManagerLaurent Robert has been capped by France and have been with number of Europe's biggest clubs in England, Portugal, and his native France.  I've spent a lot of time with him, and I know a lot about his game. He'll be a big asset to the team, he's got pace, his ability on free kicks is top class and he's a great finisher. – John Carver, Head CoachLaurent Robert is no stranger to Toronto FC head coach John Carver. He played for Carver while he was with Newcastle United.Robert will be available the game on Saturday against D.C. United, pending the completion of his International Transfer Certificate.Frank Clair, the Canadian Football League (CFL) coach and architect of the powerhouse Ottawa Rough Riders of the 1960s and 70s died Sunday at the age of 87 in Sarasota, Florida, United States.Nicknamed "The Professor" for his skills at recognising talent, teaching the game, and ability to get the most from players, Clair first came to Canada to coach the Toronto Argonauts in 1950 and ended his first CFL year with a Grey Cup championship; repeating with the Argos in 1952.  He left the Argonauts following a salary dispute and ended up in Ottawa in 1956 where he took on the daunting task of reviving the Rough Riders team which were poorly run and disorganised.  He led the team to an incredible 14 consecutive seasons of playoff appearances and three Grey Cups.He retired from coaching following the 1969 Grey Cup to take over the general manager position. At that time, Clair led the CFL in seasons coached (19), regular-season victories (147), playoff seasons (17), consecutive playoff seasons (14), playoff victories (22), Grey Cup appearances (six) and Grey Cup victories (five).  His winning ways continued as GM when Ottawa won the 1973 and 1976 Grey Cups.  Nevertheless, he was let go in 1978 and Ottawa has not won a Grey Cup since.According to the Ottawa Sun, former sports editor Jane O'Hara described Clair as a no-nonsense, to-the-point, type of gentleman who was short on smiles, but always seen coaching his team wearing a snap-brim fedora and standing poker-faced and erect on the sidelines.He was inducted into the CFL Hall of Fame in 1981 as a builder and the Ottawa stadium (Frank Clair Stadium at Lansdowne Park) was renamed in his honour in 1993.Legia Warszawa have been kicked out of the 2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup and have received a one year ban in a future season. UEFA referee Mario Vlk of Slovakia abandoned the match at half time after hundreds of fans of Legia went onto the field and tried to pull down the goalposts and destroy advertising boardings. The fans clashed with police and threw trash onto the field. Lithuanian police used tear gas to stop the violence and made about 100 arrests.Due to the fact that Legia has been expelled, FK Vetra automatically will face Blackburn Rovers in the third and final round. The match was awarded to FK Vetra 3-0. The 2nd Leg of the tie was cancelled.UEFA made a statement in regards to Legia's most recent hooligan problem. "Although Legia said they had done much to curb hooliganism in the past three years, the body identified an "obvious problem with Legia supporters at away matches on the continent". In reaching its decision, it added: "Legia must react quickly and firmly if the club wishes to participate in UEFA competition in future. With Legia's considerable disciplinary record for away matches, the duty of playing matches against Legia becomes a tall order that UEFA cannot afford to support any longer." Legia have until Saturday if they wish to appeal the ban.On Monday, Leicester-based football club Leicester City secured their first Premier League title as London-based clubs Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur drew 2–2 at Stamford Bridge.Leicester City played 36 matches and collected 77 points. On Sunday, they drew 1–1 with Manchester United at Old Trafford. But Monday's draw eliminated the mathematical possibility of Spurs equalling the point tally of The Foxes with only two matches to play and a lead of seven points.Leicester lost only three times in those 36 matches, once against Liverpool and twice against Arsenal. Since November 21, after a 3–0 victory against Newcastle United, The Foxes have stayed at first position in the League table.The Foxes were seen as underdogs at the beginning of the season as they managed to escape relegation in the 2014–2015 season where they needed 21 points from their last nine matches. Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy were key players on Claudio Ranieri's team. Vardy netted 22 goals in 34 appearances in League matches — including goals in 11 matches consecutively, a League record. While Riyad Mahrez won the PFA Players' Player of the Year award last week, Jamie Vardy was voted the footballer of the year by the Football Writers' Association.Manager Claudio Ranieri was full of praise for his team's togetherness and diligence over the course of the season. "The players have been fantastic. Their focus, their determination, their spirit has made this possible. Every game they fight for each other and I love to see this in my players. They deserve to be champions."The League trophy is to be presented to The Foxes after their upcoming game against Everton. They also qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time in the club's 132-year history.Australian swimmer Leisel Jones has broken two swimming world records this week. Swimming at the Australian trials in Melbourne for the Commonwealth Games, Leisel knocked over one second off her old 200 m breast stroke world record, coming in at 2:20.54.Two days later she did it again, this time knocking almost half a second off the 100 m breast stroke. Finishing in 1:05.71 she regained the 100 m record from Jessica Hardy, who had beaten Leisel's old record in the semi-finals at last years World Championships in Montreal.Also at the trials, Libby Lenton set a new 100 m freestyle world record of 53.42 and Jade Edmistone reduced the 50 m breast stroke record to 30.31.Butch Leitzinger and Elliot Forbes-Robinson drove the #4 Pontiac Crawford GTO into victory lane at Daytona International Speedway late Thursday night as the winner of the Grand American Rolex Sports Car Series Brumos Porsche 250.  Early in the race, the #66 car driven by Jorg Bergmeister and Max Papis passed the #10 car in the pole position, maintaining the lead positions for most of the race.The second caution at lap 32 occurred after a car spun on the infield.  The caution lasted 3 laps, and only two laps later a two-car crash happened, sending the race into its third caution.  The #06 car, driven by Rob Dyson and Harrison Brix, lost a portion of the car's hood on lap 43 and had to pit, causing the car to drop down a lap.The Howard-Boss Motorsports #4 car stole the lead position from the #19 Finlay Motorsports car at lap 47, a position it would hold for the remainder of the race. The #10 car with drivers Wayne Taylor and Max Angelelli silently climbed back up to the 2nd position with 17 laps to go.  The debuting #65 Pontiac GTO car, sponsored by Auto Gallery, was hit on the backstretch in the left front tire, causing him to spin and hit the wall with 14 laps to go.  A similar event happened five laps later when another car spun out.  Neither instances resulted in a caution.Leongatha upset ladder leaders Traralgon in their round six Gippsland Football League clash by four goals at the Traralgon Recreation Reserve. As a result, Traralgon sit second on the ladder on percentage.Leongatha trailed by ten points at quarter time with Traralgon leading four goals and four behinds, twenty eight (4-4 (28)) to two goals and six behinds, eighteen (2-6 (18)). Their second quarter tally of ten bahinds was the difference at half time as they lead 5-16 (46) to 5-6 (36).More inaccurate kicking in the third quarter kept Traralgon in the game as Leongatha took what was effectively a two goal lead into the final break. They lead 8-21 (69) to 8-9 (57).Leongatha straightened up in the last quarter kicking 5-3 (33) to 3-3 (21) for the quarter. Final scores - Leongatha 13-24 (102) defeated Traralgon 11-12 (78). The Gippsland Football League (officially Gippsland League, GL) is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.Leongatha hosted Morwell last Saturday in round two of the Gippsland Football League (officially Gippsland League, GL). Leongatha had previously come off a one point loss to Wonthaggi, and Morwell had beaten Warragul by 84 points.In other round two matches, Warragul lost to Sale, Traralgon defeated Warragul, and Maffra defeated Moe.Morwell cemented their place on top of the GL ladder with a seven goal victory. They lead by four goals at the end of the first quarter and by two goals at half time. Leongatha could not overtake Morwell in the second half, kicking only five goals compared to Morwell's ten. Ultimately, Morwell's score of 19-12 (126) defeated Leongatha's 12-11 (83). The Gippsland Football League is considered one of the "major leagues" controlled by the Victorian Country Football League, the governing body of Australian rules football in regional Victoria, Australia. At the league's annual general meeting in December, it changed it's name from the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League.Levi Leipheimer of United States has won stage 19 of the 2007 Tour de France in a time of 1h 2' 44"."I feel this is maybe the best day of my life," said Leipheimer. "It's my first Tour de France stage win and after this I think I deserve to stand on the podium in Paris."Alberto Contador of Spain keeps the yellow jersey. He is now only 23 seconds ahead of Cadel Evans, who took second place in this 55.5 km individual time trial stage.Leipheimer is in third overall, only 31 seconds behind Contador and 8 seconds behind Evans. When were the top three this close heading into the final stage? As close as it is, there will probably be no change at the top tomorrow."I've done all I could," said Evans. "I lost 55 seconds in the ascent of the Col de Peyresourde - that is where I lost the Tour," he added, recalling stage 15."I'm not going to attack Cadel on Sunday. He's a better sprinter anyway." said Leipheimer, who seems to enjoy that his team Discovery Channel Pro Cycling has almost certainly won, not only the yellow jersey for Contador, but also the team classification where they hold a massive advantage. "We've won this Tour and have two stage wins," he said.On Tuesday German football club FC Bayern Munich announced striker Robert Lewandowski has signed a contract extension until June 2021.Lewandowski joined the Munich club in the summer of 2014 from Bayern's arch rivals Borussia Dortmund after losing in the UEFA Champions League final against Bayern Munich. Since 2014, the Polish national team captain has scored 58 goals in 77 Bundesliga appearances for Bayern Munich. Spending two seasons at the Allianz Arena, Lewandowski has won two consecutive Bundesliga titles and one DFB-Pokal cup — Bayern defeated Borussia Dortmund 4–3 in a penalty shootout to win this last title.Per the previous contract Lewandowski was tied with Bayern till 2019. This year Lewandowski led Poland to the UEFA Euro 2016 quarter-finals only to lose against Portugal. He scored one goal and two penalties in penalty shootouts in the tournament.The 28-year-old striker scored 30 league goals last season, finishing as the league top scorer. This season, Lewandowski has scored 11 goals in 14 Bundesliga appearances.After signing the contact extension Lewandowski said, "I'm very happy the negotiations yielded a positive result and that I'll stay at Bayern for a few more years. We still have ambitious goals." ((de))German language: ‍Ich freue mich sehr, dass die Verhandlungen zu einem positiven Ergebnis geführt haben und ich dem FC Bayern noch einige Jahre verbunden bleibe. Gemeinsam haben wir noch große Ziele.Last month, Bayern Munich announced French winger Franck Ribéry signed a one-year contract extension with the club.McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won his first pole position and together with his teammate Fernando Alonso will start from the front row oftomorrow FIA Formula-1 2007 Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montréal, Canada.During the first and second qualifying session Alonso stayed in the lead of his young companion, but on the dying lap of the third he lost the pole to Lewis by nearly half of a second.The qualifying sessions on this track showed a number of driver errors, most notable of them was a collision of Heikki Kovallainen, Renault, when the Finn attacked the concrete wall too aggressively, causing severe damage to the back of his car.Race stewards voided the penultimate lap done by Nick Heidfeld, when he mistakenly cut one of the track turns. However, in the last of his hotlaps, he had an error-free lap that counted and nabbed the third starting spot, overtaking both Ferrari cars of Massa and Raikkonen.This pole became the major step to the first Formula One victory for Lewis, after he won four consecutive second places in the previous races.Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won the pole position on his home soil at FIA Formula-1 2007 Santander British Grand Prix on the Silverstone Circuit at Silverstone, Northamptonshire, England.His teammate Fernando Alonso was in the lead for the first two qualifying sessions, but lost 0.150 seconds to Lewis and only 0.048 to Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen despite Kimi's error in Woodcote, end of sector three. Another Ferrari driver Felipe Massa placed fourth.Robert Kubica and Ralf Schumacher won the third row for their teams, BMW Sauber and Toyota respectively. Both Renault drivers on the fourth row of the starting grid. Top ten was closed by another BMW and Toyota cars.McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won from pole position his first FIA Formula-1 2007 Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montréal, Canada.Fernando Alonso, his teammate, made a mistake in the first chicane right after the start and Nick Heidfeld, BMW, slipped to the second place. Alonso fought hard to stay on the third place, but the pace car, which appeared four times today, spoiled his attempts. The double World Champion was penalized by 10 seconds stop-and-go, together with Nico Rosberg from Williams-Toyota, for the pit-stop error while the safety car was on the track. Alonso still battled for points, finishing in 7th place, 21.9 seconds behind his winning teammate. While Rosberg placed tenth as a result of this penalty, his teammate Alexander Wurz closed the podium third.It seemed that some of the Formula One drivers forgot how to drive under safety car conditions, resulting in the black flag (disqualification) for Felipe Massa, Ferrari and Giancarlo Fisichella, Renault.Two Finns, teammates for Fisichella and Massa, Heikki Kovalainen and Kimi Räikkönen placed 4th and 5th. Takuma Sato, Super Aguri-Honda driver placed 6th.The race featured a catastrophic accident with Robert Kubica from Poland, who crashed his BMW on the entry to the hairpin turn. There was nothing left of his car except the driver's monocoque which flew a considerable distance, bouncing from one concrete wall to another on the other side of the track.

The Boston Celtics beat the Los Angeles Lakers 92–86 on Sunday in game five of the seven-game series. The Celtics may have underperformed over the season, but in these 2010 playoffs, they have been playing like the championship team they were two years ago. Though Kobe Bryant scored 38 points, there were no other other major point contributors from the Lakers. Pau Gasol scored twelve points, and Derek Fisher added nine points. The Celtics' Paul Pierce scored 27 points, and their other two "big three" players (Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen) scored 30 points between them, with Allen scoring 12 and Garnett adding 18. Rajon Rondo also had a good scoring game, contributing 18 points. For the final two games, if there are two games, the Lakers will have home-court advantage at Los Angeles' Staples Center. Kobe Bryant is a proven scorer, and Pau Gasol uses his size to pick out rebounds. The Celtics have the "big three" group of veteran players and also Rajon Rondo, a potential superstar. After the Celtic's win in game five, and a three-thousand mile journey back home, the Lakers find themselves needing to win tonight to tie the series and deny the Celtics the win they need to wrap up the 2010 championship.Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella announced Sunday that he will retire from Major League Baseball after almost fifty years of coaching, managing, and playing the sport. Piniella's announcement came after the Chicago Cubs lost to the Atlanta Braves 16-5 at the Cub's Wrigley Field. The 66 year-old Piniella said that he was retiring because of family issues.

The best thing to do is to step down, go home and take care of my mother," he added.During his 18 year career as a player, Piniella logged 1,705 hits. As a manager, he also won 1,800 games over the course of 23 years.

Barcelona also defeated their arch-rivals Real Madrid 4–0 in November.Barcelona technical secretary Robert Fernandez attended the ceremony and collected the award on behalf of Enrique, who did not attend the function. Fernandez said "It must have been a very difficult choice because the other candidates [are of] very, very high quality,". He also added that Enrique wanted to share the award with all those people who "who have supported him in difficult times and good times. The staff, the president, the board, the fans and our players. This is an incredible dream team that has pushed us forward." Earlier in the ceremony, Jill Ellis, who coached the United States's women's football team to win the World Cup, was announced as the FIFA Football Women's Coach of the year.A full crowd showed up at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon earlier today, only to watch their home side fall to Roma of Italy.  The previous leg in the series saw the two teams draw 0-0 which gave Roma a slight advantage from the start, as a draw would allow them to advance.  The previous match was extremely undisciplined, and Roma was given eight yellow cards.  The Italian side showed a much calmer demeanor this game, earning only two yellows in comparison to Lyon's four.Lyon produced the first chance of the game as Romas keeper Alexandre Doni was unable to cope with Juninho, but defender Philippe Mexes was able to clear the ball from nearby strikers.  Roma had their own chance soon after, as Daniele De Rossi was left open, and he headed the ball home.  The goal was disallowed by the referee after he spotted a push by De Rossi on Eric Abidal.  Juninho continued to threaten Roma, but his crosses were not able to do any damage to the Rossinari.  Lyon fell behind on 22 minutes when Max Tonetto clipped a cross into the middle, and Francesco Totti was in the right place to head the ball past Gregory Coupet.  Crosses continued to be the only attack Lyon could muster, and they produced a good chance off a Juninho corner kick.  The ball ricoched off several players before Squillaci latch on for a shot, but the ball was sent directly at Doni, and the keeper made the save.  Mancini then doubled the visitors lead just before halftime.  After some quick stepovers to fool Anthony Reveillere, he struck the ball soundly into the top corner of the net.After the break, Roma could have killed off the game indefinitely, as Tadei beat Lyon's offside trap, but was unable to regain the composure required to smash the ball home.  Doni then produced a few saves for Roma, kicking out Sylvan Wiltord's shot, and then diving to palm away a curling shot by Juninho.  Both teams then made vain attempts for a penalty, but both Fred and Perrotta diving, but the referee made the right decisions and awarded only a yellow to Perrotta.  Fred was then given a yellow for cruelly smashing Chivu in the face with his arm.  Fred was lucky to receive a red for his actions.  Roma held on for the win, and the 5 time french champions bowed out of the Champions League.Maffra defeated Drouin in the 2010 Gippsland Football League grand final.

As a result, he will be benched for 50 games.The baseball players' union stated, Ramirez said the positive test resulted from a medication prescribed by a doctor, and not from a steroid. Ramirez waived his right to challenge the suspension.Said Ramirez: "Recently I saw a physician for a personal health issue. He gave me a medication, not a steroid, which he thought was okay to give me. Unfortunately, the medication was banned under our drug policy. Under the policy that mistake is now my responsibility. I have been advised not to say anything more for now. I do want to say one other thing; I've taken and passed about 15 drug tests over the past five seasons."Ramirez is the biggest star player to test positive for drugs since Rafael Palmeiro, and the first major star to be suspended under baseball's stricter drug-testing rules.Ramirez is reported to lose at least 31% of his US$25-million salary as a result of the suspension.

The trade is yet to be finalized, pending a physical examination and agreement on a contract extension, but an agreement is expected to be made before 5:00 EST Friday.In exchange for the three-time all-star and two-time Cy Young award winner, the Twins would receive outfielder Carlos Gómez, and three right-handed pitchers, Philip Humber, Deolis Guerra, and Kevin Mulvey.Santana is reportedly looking for a 6 to 7 year deal worth around US$150 million, and has been on the trading block for some months now. This trade comes just days after the Twins signed multi-year contracts to two of their other stars, Michael Cuddyer and Justin Morneau. Cuddyer signed a three-year, $24 million deal, and Morneau was given $80 million over six years.Santana has a 93-44 in his 6 season career with the Twins, recording over 235 strikeouts per season the past 3 seasons.

Second was On A Jeune and third placegetter was Xcellent.The Melbourne Cup is the richest horse race in Australia, with prize money in 2005 of A$5,000,000, and is one of the richest horse races in the world. It is run annually on the first Tuesday of November at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, over a distance of 3,200 meters (which is slightly under 2 miles). An estimated crowd of 140,000 flocked to the Flemington Racecourse to watch the race.This is the first time in the history of the race, first held in 1861, that the same horse has won the race three times. With this being the third consecutive year that Makybe Diva has won the Melbourne Cup, comparisons are now being made to legendary Australian horse Phar Lap. Four other horses have won the race twice, of which three won it in consecutive years.Makybe Diva was ridden by Glen Boss, and was trained by Lee Freedman. Freedman said on the morning of the race that a win would be a "Herculean task" to achieve. The owners of Makybe Diva received A$3,000,000 in prize money, as well as trophies valued at A$100,000. A$750,000 was awarded to the second placegetter, and A$375,000 to third place, with the remaining prize money distributed amongst the fourth through the tenth placegetters.Lewis Gordon Pugh, 37, a man from the United Kingdom has become the first person to swim at the North pole. The water, 29 degrees F (-1.8 C), is believed to be the coldest waters any human has ever swam in on the planet."I am obviously ecstatic to have succeeded but this swim is a triumph and a tragedy. A triumph that I could swim in such ferocious conditions, but a tragedy that it's possible to swim at the North Pole," said Pugh who swam 0.6 miles in just under 19 minutes through cracks in icebergs.Pugh says he swam at the North Pole to demonstrate the effects that global warming is playing on the Earth and is hoping that his act will gain the attention of leaders from around the world."The decisions which they make over the next few years will determine the biodiversity of our world. I want my children, and their children, to know that polar bears are still living in the Arctic — these creatures are on the front line up here," added Pugh.The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which sponsored the swim, states that the only reason Pugh was able to swim in the freezing waters was due to global warming."[The swim was] a bittersweet victory, as this swim has only been possible because of climate change," said WWF U.K. spokesman, Colin Butfield. The waters were completely frozen ten years ago and the swim would have been impossible to complete.Pugh has also swum in the waters of Antarctica where he was credited to being the only person to swim so far south earning him the nickname "The Polar Bear." Pugh also swam the Indian Ocean."It was frightening. The pain was immediate and felt like my body was on fire. I was in excruciating pain from beginning to end and I nearly quit on a few occasions. It was without doubt the hardest swim of my life," added Pugh.Reading and Manchester United clashed today in a fifth round FA cup replay at the Madjeski Stadium.  Neither team fielded a full strength side, with Leroy Lita and Steven Hunt von the bench for Reading, and Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney as substitutes for United.United started the game with a blitz, scoring 3 goals in the first 6 minutes.  Gabriel Heinze started the scoring by shooting in a John O'Shea cross. Two minutes later, Louis Saha received a long ball from Rio Ferdinand and sent the ball into the back of the net, doubling the lead. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer then scored the 3rd, as he beat the offside trap and curled the ball into the net.  Reading did not give up the fight, and scored on 23 minutes, when Dave Kitson headed home an Ingimarson cross.  The game stayed at the 3-1 scoreline for much of the rest of the game, until 84 minutes, when Leroy Lita scored to force an edgy finish.  Litas powerful header off a Glen Little cross left keeper Edwin Van Der Sar helpless, leaving Reading in sight of extra time.  A shot by Brynjar Gunnarsson which rattled of the crossbar could have caused an amazing comeback, but Manchester United were able to hold on, and advance to the sixth round of the FA cup.Manchester will face Middlesbrough in the next round, who defeated West Bromwich Albion today after a penalty shootout.After six seasons, English Premier football club Liverpool F.C. and manager Rafael Benítez have parted ways. The separation was by mutual consent.The 50-year-old Spaniard joined the club in June 2004, replacing Gerard Houllie. He had early success with the club, earning the Champions League title over A.C. Milan in 2005 and the FA Cup title the next season, before returning to the Champions League final in 2007, this time losing to A.C. Milan.Under Benítez, Liverpool has a less than stellar home success for the club with the most major trophies in English football, finishing second in the league just once, while finishing third and fourth twice each.Liverpool Chairman Martin Broughton thanked Benítez for his service, saying that after a seventh-place finish in the Premier League this season, it was time to move on."Rafa will forever be part of Liverpool folklore after bringing home the Champions League following the epic final in Istanbul but after a disappointing season both parties felt a fresh start would be best for all concerned," Broughton said, in a statement released by the club today."It is very sad for me to announce that I will no longer be manager of Liverpool F.C," Benítez said, in a statement released by the club. "I would like to thank all of the staff and players for their efforts."I'll always keep in my heart the good times I've had here, the strong and loyal support of the fans in the tough times and the love from Liverpool. I have no words to thank you enough for all these years and I am very proud to say that I was your manager."Thank you so much once more and always remember: You'll never walk alone."On Wednesday, English football club Manchester City F.C. announced that they had loaned their goalkeeper Joe Hart to Italian club Torino F.C. till the season end.Hart joined City from Shrewsbury Town F.C. in 2006. Since then, he has won four Premier League Golden Gloves for keeping most clean sheets in a season, which is a League record. In a decade at the Etihad Stadium, Hart has won two Premier League trophies, two Football League Cups and one FA Cup. Hart debuted for England at the age of 21, and has represented the country at UEFA Euro 2012 and 2016 and FIFA World Cup 2014. Signing the contract, Hart said, "I am very excited to compare myself in an important and beautiful League such as Serie A." ((it))Italian language: ‍Sono molto felice di potermi confrontare in un campionato bello e difficile come la Serie A.Goalkeeper Joe Hart's move away from Manchester City came about a week after Pep Guardiola signed Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo from FC Barcelona.Manchester United made it to the FA cup final after a 4-1 thrashing of Newcastle United at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff today.Manchester United, the holders always dominated the game and it only took 19 minutes for Ruud van Nistelrooy to break the deadlock. It appeared that the referee Mike Reilly had awarded a penalty to the red devils, but it was a freekick Newcastle's way for Cristiano Ronaldo's dive. Paul Scholes added his name to the score sheet just before half-time with a header.The game was effectively over when Van Nistelrooy scored another one on 58 minutes, a side-foot past Newcastle's 'keeper Shay Given. A minute later and Newcastle scored through Shola Ameobi, but all hopes of a Newcastle come back were quashed when Cristiano Ronaldo capitalised on van Nistelrooy's generosity to shoot home to make it 4-1 to the reds.Manchester United will meet Arsenal in the FA Cup final in May.Today, association football club Manchester United F.C. announced they appointed Portuguese José Mourinho as their new manager for the next three seasons with an option to stay at the club until 2020. Mourinho's predecessor Louis van Gaal was fired on Monday after two-years of service at Old Trafford. Manchester United finished in fifth position in the Premier League this season under Dutchman Louis van Gaal and missed out on UEFA Champions League qualification, but won the FA Cup 2–1 against Crystal Palace.Mourinho previously served London-based club Chelsea in two spells and won the Premier League with them three times, lastly in the 2014–15 season. He also worked with Spain's capital club Real Madrid winning one La Liga title with Los Blancos, Champions League and domestic league titles with Portuguese club FC Porto and Italian club Internazionale.Mourinho has a 66% win record and 2.19 points-per-match ratio in the Premier League, the best in the league. In his first season (2004-05) at Chelsea, The Blues won the title with a record high 95 points. Ed Woodward, Manchester United's executive vice-chairman, praised Mourinho saying "Jose is quite simply the best manager in the game today. He has won trophies and inspired players in countries across Europe and, of course, he knows the Premier League very well, having won three titles here". Mourinho said, "It is a club known and admired throughout the world. There is a mystique and a romance about it which no other club can match".Mourinho has won trophies in four different countries. His team is to face German side Borussia Dortmund and local rivals Manchester City in club friendlies during July.On Wednesday, in the UEFA Europa League final, Manchester United defeated Dutch capital-club Ajax AFC 0–2 to win the Europa League title and qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage despite finishing sixth in the Premier League this season.  A deflected goal from Paul Pogba's left-footed shot in the first half and a flick goal by Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the second half ensured that José Mourinho's side lifts its third trophy in this season, previously winning Community Shield and the EFL Cup.Before the kick-off, a one-minute silence was observed at the Friends Arena, Stockholm, for the victims of a suicide attack in Manchester Arena on Monday. The English side had just 33% ball possession in the entire match, completing 192 passes out of 276. A comparatively young Ajax team, with the average age of the starting lineup no more than 23 years, had 88% passing accuracy, with 565 successful passes. Manchester United had better numbers for defense, recovering 64 balls – 22 more than Ajax, and had almost twice as many ball clearances as the Dutch counterpart. A total of 32 fouls were committed in the match, and the official booked six players – three players of each side received a yellow card.At the age of 17 years and 285 days, Ajax's Matthijs de Ligt became the youngest player to play in the Europa League final, while Marcus Rashford became the youngest winner of the tournament at the age of 19 years and 205 days.A deflection off Davinson Sánchez from Paul Pogba's left-footed shot gave United an early lead. Ajax's shot-stopper saved Antonio Valencia's close-range strike. Another attempt in the first half by Ajax's Bertrand Traoré was saved by Sergio Romero. The half time ended 0–1. Minutes into the second half, Armenian midfielder Mkhitaryan scored a goal just in front of Ajax's net, which doubled Manchester's lead. Five players were booked in the second half. Ajax's attempts in the final minutes of the game were stopped by Romero, not giving them a chance to reduce the difference. Last season, Premier League club Liverpool FC lost the Europa finals against Spanish side Sevilla FC. United is the first English club to win the Europa since 2013. This season's Premier League winners Chelsea won the tournament four years ago against Benfica at Ajax's ground, Amsterdam ArenA. Since then, Sevilla has added three Europa titles to their collection.After the match, Ajax's coach Peter Bosz said, "We're obviously disappointed. I didn't see the Ajax team I'm used to, pressing and competing for first balls. We weren't good enough. Often, to win finals you must first lose them. It's all new for all my team. They will learn a lot from it and if we keep the squad together they will be stronger for it." Bosz's first season as Ajax's coach ended trophy-less.Manchester United's boss José Mourinho said, "We are in the Champions League in the right way and for me the right way is winning the Premier League or winning the Europa League. We were not strong enough to win the Premier League but we were strong enough to win the Europa League and we are back in the Champions League. The club now has every trophy in world football. We fought hard for this since the beginning. We totally deserved the win. I am so happy to see all the players, including the boys with the crutches, with the trophy." The Portuguese has won two Champions League titles – one each with FC Porto and Inter, and two Europa titles – the first one with Porto.United became the fifth team after Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Juventus, and Ajax to win all three major UEFA trophies – European Cup Winners' Cup, the European Cup (rebranded as Champions League) and UEFA Cup (rebranded as Europa League). They are to face the winner of Real Madrid and Juventus in the Champions League final in the UEFA Super Cup scheduled on August 8 at the Philip II Arena in Skopje.José Mourinho, Manchester United manager‍:"We are in the Champions League in the right way and for me the right way is winning the Premier League or winning the Europa League."On Saturday, Manchester-based football club Manchester United defeated Tottenham-based football club Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 in Old Trafford stadium in Greater Manchester.Both the teams had 50% possession of the ball. The match saw only five yellow cards, two for The Red Devils and three for away players. A total of 24 fouls were committed in the match, twelve by each side. In the 22nd minute, Tottenham's Kyle Walker scored an own goal which gave Manchester United three win-points. Manchester United's defender Chris Smalling was awarded Man of The Match. Harry Kane displayed his skill during the game, but did not score.Manchester United had five players debutants: Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Romero, French defender Morgan Schneiderlin, Italian full back Matteo Darmian, 21-year-old Dutch winger Memphis Depay, and ex-Bayern Munich midfeilder Bastian Schweinsteiger who was substituted in at the 60th minute.After the match, Walker said, "I tried to stick my foot in the way so that [Rooney would] kick my foot instead of the ball, so it's a bit unlucky really as I'd made up a lot of ground to get there."Louis van Gaal, manager of Manchester United, said of Spaniard David de Gea, "I'm not the most important part. The most important part is the player and the club who wants to buy him. He's our best player for the past two or three years so we cannot let him go so easily. We want to sell at the same level as we pay. We want to keep him of course."Manchester United took on Fulham today at Craven Cottage, with the Premier League leaders hoping to open a 9 point gap above second place Chelsea, who are not playing this weekend in the league.  Fulham on the other hand needs points to stay out of the relegation zone, and wanted to pull 12 clear of 18th place Charlton Athletic.  Both teams fielded strong starting sides with Fulham playing Canadian Thomasz Radzinski and American Brian McBride.  The Red Devils starting 11 included Henrik Larsson, the on-loan striker from Helsingborgs, Wayne Rooney as his strike partner, and the Portuguese star Christiano Ronaldo in the midfield.Fulham started out the game strongly, with a Simon Davies volley which was thumped just right of Edwin Van Der Sar's post.  After 17 minutes, United defender Nemanja Vidic got tied up with his goal keeper, and Brian McBride was able to sweep in the ball off the post, giving Fulham a deserved lead.  With United in need of some inspiration, Ronaldo banged a shot just wide of the net.  On 19 minutes, Wayne Rooney made a run down the right side, and crossed the ball to skipper Ryan Giggs who clipped the ball off the outside of his boot, and into the opposite side of the goal, tying the match.  Evra should have put the leaders in front, but his wide open volley was dragged wide and the game went into halftime drawn 1 - 1.After the break, Fulham came out stronger yet again, and Van Der Sar was forced to make a great one handed save off Davies shot.  On 52 minutes, Van Der Sar could only watch as Thomas Radzinski blasted a header off his crossbar, but did not drop into the net.  Van Der Sar earned his money this day, as he was forced into another spectacular save after a Brian McBride shot was aimed for the bottom corner, but was denied by the Dutchman.  With the clock winding down, United began to pressure, and Christiano Ronaldo had an inspired run, beating out three defenders, and lashing the ball into the bottom right corner of the net, past Jan Lastuvka, giving the Red Devils a 2 - 1 lead with only 2 minutes remaining in normal time.  Fulham pressed for an equilizer, but Manchester prevailed, continuing their winning run this season.On Monday, English football club Manchester United sacked their manager Louis van Gaal just two days after his team won the 2015–16 FA Cup — the twelfth FA Cup victory for The Red Devils. Appointed as the manager of the club in July 2014, Dutchman van Gaal said "I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three-year plan." This year's FA Cup was Manchester United's first trophy under van Gaal.Under his management, Manchester United landed fourth and fifth in the Premier League table, and this season they missed UEFA Champions League qualification. They had 58.47% possession, the best average in the league, and eighteen cleansheets, but The Red Devils scored only 49 goals in the league, the worst they have done in more than last two decades. Louis van Gaal was informed by Ed Woodward, Vice-Chariman of Manchester United, that the club would sack him from the managerial position. van Gaal is reportedly to receive about £6million, his annual salary, before leaving for Portugal.In the FA Cup final versus Crystal Palace, the first half ended in a 0–0 draw. In the 78th minute Jason Puncheon scored for Crystal Palace but minutes later, Juan Mata equalised. The 90-minute mark ended with 1–1 on the score board. Chris Smalling received his second yellow card and was sent off minutes before Jesse Lingard scored the winner from a volley in the 110th minute. With the FA Cup title, according to Woodward, Louis van Gaal has won a title in four different nations.Yesterday, English football club Manchester United F.C. announced signing Frenchman Paul Pogba from Italian club Juventus F.C. Pogba rejoined The Red Devils on a five-year contract for €105 million making him the most expensive footballer of all time by breaking the previous fee record of Gareth Bale's transfer from Tottenham Hotspur to Spanish capital club Real Madrid.23-year-old midfielder Paul Pogba made his professional debut for United in 2011 after graduating from their academy. He played only seven games before leaving for Juventus the next year. Spending four years with the Old Lady, Pogba has won four Serie A titles, three Italian Super Cups, and two Coppa Italia trophies as well.Pogba has played 38 games for the French side, netting six goals. Last month he collected a silver medal with the national team finishing runners-up at the UEFA Euro 2016, losing 1–0 to Portugal. This year, Pogba was named in the FIFA FIFPro team of the year as well as the UEFA team of the year.After signing the five-year contract, Paul Pogba said, "I am delighted to rejoin United. It has always been a club with a special place in my heart and I am looking forward to working with [United manager] José Mourinho." Mourinho praised Pogba and said Pogba "will be a key part of the United team".Pogba has been allotted the number 6 jersey. Previously, Manchester United signed Zlatan Ibrahimović, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, and Eric Bailly.The former Argentine soccer player Diego Armando Maradona, aged 44,  was honored  with the keys to the Colombian city of Cartagena. Maradona is in Cartagena recovering from stomach surgery he had to reduce the size of his waist. The surgury was necessary because Maradona is suffering of severe obesity problems which may put his life at risk. He is 5 foot 6 inches (1.67 meters) tall and  weighs  267  pounds (121 kg). The Argentine was grateful for the homage and showed good humour:"I want to thank the mayor for giving me the keys to the city. Even though I do not have the keys to my own house, I have a key to the people, like those of Cartagena, and it fills me with pride." He added: "I offer my thanks in my own name, in the name of my two daughters and that of my whole family. Thank you Cartagena and thank you Colombia."Four months and 3,200 kilometres ago, Canadian runner Jonathan Howard began his run across the second-largest country in the world, to raise awareness for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).A graduate of McMaster University, Howard arrived in Toronto this week, to address the nation's largest city before continuing his westward run which will take him through all ten Canadian provinces.Howard was met Monday at a charity barbecue by Senator Art Eggleton. The fundraiser was part of Howard's strategy to raise 2.5 million dollars to assist families that support children with ASD.  "Spectrum is a very puzzling word," he told the gathering "because there are many types of autism on that spectrum". The real goal of his RunTheDream.ca charity drive though, Howard explained, was simply to "get people involved in the issue" and generate attention for the little-understood disorder.Eggleton, who welcomed Terry Fox to the city as mayor in 1980, drew comparisons to the Marathon of Hope runner who became a Canadian icon. While praising Howard's efforts to raise money and awareness, the senator said he believed that "an awful lot more needs to be done" at the political level to combat the financial and emotional difficulties that face those dealing with autism.Howard reassured supporters that he still intended to reach Victoria, B.C. before December 31. "The challenges are great," he confessed "but as long as the determination is greater, anything can be achieved".Terry Robinson, a two-time Canadian Paralympic contender born with cerebral palsy, pledged to follow Howard's journey two weeks ago on its three-month leg from Ottawa to Winnipeg.Robinson addressed the city, speaking about how his own disabilities left him with an appreciation for how important it was to ensure that people struggling with autism had access to services that could support them.On Friday, German football club Borussia Dortmund announced they are to sign Spanish defender Marc Bartra from FC Barcelona on a four-year deal. Dortmund has agreed to pay ‎€8million for the centre-back.Marc Bartra graduated from Barcelona's La Masia youth academy and made his professional debut for the Catalonians in February 2010 against Atlético Madrid, under the management of Pep Guardiola when he was 19-years old.Bartra has made over 100 appearances for the club and won five La Liga titles; two each of UEFA Champions League trophies, Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cups, and Supercopa de España titles; and one FIFA Club World Cup.Borussia Dortmund's website reported some clarifications are still required before making the move.Coach Marcello Lippi has confirmed his squad for the March 13th charity match against Manchester United at Old Trafford.  Lippi has been recruiting some of the best players from across Europe in the past weeks to participate in the match, which celebrates 50 years since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, as well as 50 years of Manchester United participating in European competitions.  Three more players have been added, one German, one Italian, and one Swede.  The players form a 22 man squad, which already includes the likes of Ronaldinho, Henrik Larsson, and Ronaldo.Yesterday, former Hull City football-club manager Marco Silva joined Watford as the head coach, penning a two-year-contract. Via their official website, Hull City announced Marco Silva had decided to leave the club on Thursday.39-year-old Portuguese Silva succeeded Walter Mazzarri by the contract with Watford. Silva enjoyed a successful spell in Portugal and Greece before he came to England. Silva led Estoril to first division promotion in the Portuguese league before joining Sporting CP.In 2014, Sporting CP won their first Portuguese Cup since 2008 under Silva's management. In 2015–16, Silva won the Greek Super League with Olympiacos FC — the club's 43rd league title. Olyampiacos defeated Arsenal in a Group Stage match at Arsenal's home ground Emirates Stadium but, finishing third in the group table, they were sent to the Europa League. Arsenal defeated Olyampiacos in the away fixture 3–0 as the Gunners booked a spot in the Last 16 round.Sliva managed Hull City for the last eighteen Premier League games last season, winning six of them, but could not save the club from relegation. Watford finished 17th in the Premier League table, one place above the relegation zone. On Thursday, Silva expressed his desire to leave Hull City. Along with the Portuguese, other Hull City staff including Assistant Head Coach Joao Pedro Sousa, First Team Coach Goncalo Pedro and Goalkeeping Coach Hugo Oliveira left the club. After Silva signed the contract with Watford, Watford's CEO Scott Duxbury said, "Marco was one of the most sought after Head Coaches in the Premier League. His pedigree and promise speaks for itself with his achievements in top divisions elsewhere across Europe, as well as his work at Hull City last season. We are delighted to have secured his services and to be welcoming a Head Coach of his profile and potential".University of Alabama running back Mark Ingram has won the 2009 Heisman Trophy, it was announced Saturday night.Ingram, the third consecutive sophomore to win the award for the top American Football player in NCAA Division I, was visibly emotional about receiving the award. The award was the first for Alabama.The margin of victory was the closest ever for the award, with just 28 points separating Ingram from the second place finisher: Stanford running back Toby Gerhart. "I'm a little overwhelmed right now," Ingram said. "I'm just so excited to bring Alabama their first Heisman winner."Ingram, who had 1542 yards rushing and 322 yards receiving this season, emerged as one of the favorites in the middle of the season, but it was the rough showings by fellow front-runners Tim Tebow and Colt McCoy in their conference title games that solidified Ingram's status and elevated Gerhart.In the SEC title game, the second-ranked Crimson Tide defeated top-ranked Gators, holding Tebow to 184 yards through the air.  In the Big 12 title game, Texas won a close game, 13–12 over Nebraska.  In the game, McCoy had 247 yards through the air and was intercepted 3 times.  A strong performance against in the same game propelled Nebraska defensive-end Ndamukong Suh to the fourth-place spot Heisman point total.Ingram — who scored 18 touchdowns so far this season — will meet McCoy in the national title game Jan. 7.Ingram also acknowledged the support of his family, his team and other students on campus."Everybody that's been in the Alabama family has been supporting me," Ingram said. "Walking to class, students flashed me the Heisman pose."Red Bull driver Mark Webber won the FIA Formula One 2009 Grande Prêmio Petrobras do Brasil Saturday at Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. Robert Kubica came in second for BMW Sauber, and Lewis Hamilton finished third for McLaren.Webber's teammate Sebastian Vettel started from 15th place on the starting grid after he couldn't come up from the first qualification session, but finished 4th in front of his championship rival.Brawn Grand Prix driver Jenson Button finished 5th to win his title. His team, representing the remnants of Honda Racing, also won the 2009 Constructors' championship after leading through the season.The team's road to victory was not smooth — a scandal broke with the "double-decker diffuser" of the BGP001 car.  After the FIA declared them legal and other teams started to borrow the idea, Brawn sped up by collecting points on the way to the title.Kimi Räikkönen (Ferrari) and Sébastien Buemi (Toro Rosso) dropped one place from the starting grid and finished behind Button.Button's teammate and possible vice-champion Rubens Barrichello, who won pole position on his home soil after nearly three hours of a long rainy qualification session, had a tire puncture on the dying laps of the race and was forced to make an unscheduled third visit to his pit. He closed in the top eight.This Brazil GP featured Japanese rookie driver, Kamui Kobayashi (Toyota), who replaced recovering Glock. In his first race this young driver qualified 11th and finished 10th in the race.Adrian Sutil qualified 3rd for Force India, but was taken out by Jarno Trulli (Toyota) on the first lap.Mark Webber gained his maiden Formula 1 win today at the German Grand Prix, after 130 races.  His Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel came in second, with Ferrari's Felipe Massa third.  Reigning champion Lewis Hamilton came last.Webber started from pole position, but touched Rubens Barrichello at the beginning after a slow start.  He received a drive through penalty for this offence, which he served at the end of his fourteenth lap.  This enabled him to join back in to the race in first place.Jenson Button remains first in the championship with 68 points, with Vettel and Webber overtaking Barrichello, taking second and third respectively.After the win, Webber said "I lost Rubens off the start, I thought he had gone to the left but he went right and I banged into him. I had a drive-through and my engineer kept me calm.  It was a difficult winter, Sebastian showed in winter testing what the car could do, so I kept my motivation high and I was hurting a lot. The team had patience with me, everyone in Australia and a few people who doubted me too so hello to them as well. So thank you to everyone who helped me here."Red Bull Racing's Mark Webber won the 2012 British Grand Prix yesterday at Silverstone, having started second on the grid behind Alonso's Ferrari.The second qualifying session of three was red-flagged due to heavy rain; but, despite this, Webber secured second on the grid behind Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, only bettered by under five hundredths of a second. Michael Schumacher, driving for Mercedes, started third with Webber's team mate Sebastian Vettel filling out the second row of the grid in fourth.The race itself started in dry weather, Alonso—running on hard tyres—took an early lead, with Webber—having opted for soft tyres—in pursuit. At the first pit stop, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton stayed out and took the lead, briefly duelling with Alonso before being passed. Shortly after the pitstop, Williams' Pastor Maldonaldo and Sauber's Sergio Perez had a collision, resulting in the Perez being knocked out of the race and Maldonaldo being fined €10,000 (£7,931, $US12,273).Also receiving a fine was Perez' team mate, Kamui Kobayashi. for a dangerous entry into his pit box that injured three of his team's mechanics. According to Kobayashi, "The front wheels locked, I couldn't control the car, and this is how I overshot the pit box."Alonso managed to hold off Webber until the final set of pit stops, but his rules-mandated switch to soft tyres left him unable to compete with the better grip of Webber's Red Bull car. Webber caught him, overtaking Alonso with comparative ease on the 48th lap and going on to cross the line some three seconds ahead of the Spaniard.With this victory, Webber is the second driver to win two races this season. After the race, he described himself as "...absolutely over the moon, absolutely rapt...".Maroochydore came from behind to defeat University 21–11 in their week five rugby union match on Australia's Sunshine Coast. Trailing 8–6 at half time, Maroochydore kicked five penalties to one in the second half to seal the win.In other matches, Caboolture defeated Nambour 65 points to 20 and Noosa defeated Fraser Coast 72 points to five. Caloundra had the bye.Sunshine Beach, Queensland — Maroochydore denied Caboolture a shot at back-to-back Sunshine Coast Rugby Union A-grade premierships today defeating them 24 points to 7 at Dolphin Oval, Sunshine Beach, Australia. Caboolture qualified for this match by beating Caloundra in the Minor Semi Final; Maroochydore lost the Major Semi Final against Noosa.Maroochydore is now set to play Noosa in the A-grade grand final while, in the lower grades, Maleny had both of its teams move through to grand final day. Their reserve grade side defeated Maroochydore 53–24 and their under 19s beating Caboolture 29–20.In the A-grade game, Maroochydore proved to dominate for Caboolture going 19–nil up at half time. They would have been a further two points up if not for a missed conversion.The second half was more of an arm wrestle with both teams scoring tries. Maroochydore would cap off the win right on full time with an unsuccessful penalty. Unlike a week earlier, those in attendance were reasonably well behaved.The Grand Final is scheduled to be held at Sunshine Coast Stadium in Bokarina, Queensland.The non-points Nextel All-Star Challenge for the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series started with controversy and ended with a popular victory for one of the sport's veterans.Mark Martin, competing in his last full Nextel Cup season, led 24 of 90 laps to win the All-Star Challenge for the second time, having done so in 1998.Martin took the lead from Elliott Sadler on the 72nd lap of the race, and never looked back, defeating Sadler by over half a second.The Nextel All-Star Challenge is an non-points race that invites Nextel Cup race winners from the previous edition of this race to the upcoming edition, as well as former Nextel Cup Series champions, and former winners of this race. There is a last-chance transfer race, the 30-lap Nextel Open, with the winner advancing to the main event, and a second driver getting in through a fan vote, though the fan vote winner must finish on the same lap as the winner. The Nextel Open is for drivers who have never won a race, or haven't won a points-paying race in a long period of time.Brian Vickers won the Open with a move that rubbed some fans-as well as the driver he beat-the wrong way.Just over 200 yards from the finish line, Vickers tapped Open pole-sitter Mike Bliss from behind, causing him to slide across the grass and end up second. Vickers got into the All-Star Challenge itself, but Bliss, who set the track record with his pole-winning lap, was none too happy with what transpired, saying afterward, "He spun me out. The only thing, I wish I would have turned right and wrecked (him)." 2004 Busch Series champion Martin Truex, Jr. finished tenth in the Open, but won the fan vote to get into the All-Star Challenge.A lap 35 crash in the All-Star Challenge itself eliminated seven drivers alone, with Truex being one of them. It started when Tony Stewart tagged Joe Nemechek, who in turn hit Kevin Harvick. Kasey Kahne, Terry Labonte, and Michael Waltrip were involved as well.Harvick was upset to be involved, but he ended up taking his frustrations out on Nemechek, not on Stewart. Nemechek fired back, saying, "Kevin thinks he owns the world, and he ain't squat....He was just being an idiot, just being Kevin." The accident brought out the red flag. Only one other caution took place, this being displayed on lap 71, when pole-sitter Ryan Newman spun and crashed in turn two, with teammate Rusty Wallace eventually becoming involved.The All-Star Challenge itself is divided into three segments. The first segment is 40 laps long, the second 30, and the third and final segment 20. Mark Martin won the first segment, with Newman winning the second. Of course, Martin won the third and final segment to claim the race.For his efforts, Martin won $1,101,325. He said over the radio that he will race in this event next year, as long as current car owner Jack Roush gives him a car.  This was marked as Martin's first Nascar Nextel Cup victory since Dover on June 6, 2004.The Marussia F1 team's test driver, Spaniard María de Villota, was taken to hospital by air ambulance today after a collision in testing at Duxford Aerodrome.At the end of her first installation run, the car she was driving had a low-speed collision with the loading ramp of the team's support truck. According to BBC Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, the car "suddenly accelerated" into the rear of the vehicle. The Marussia team released a statement an hour and a half after the accident, stating that she had been transferred to hospital, and a further statement would be issued once her condition had been assessed.A spokesman for the East of England ambulance service, Gary Sanderson, said de Villota had "[...] sustained life-threatening injuries and following treatment at the scene by paramedics, she has been taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital for further care." According to witnesses, she was motionless for about fifteen minutes as medical teams attended to her, but did move her hands before being taken away from the test track. Medical charity Magpas, whose volunteer paramedics attended the accident, reported she had sustained injuries to her head and face, and was in a 'stable condition' when she reached the hospital.Marussia reported her as conscious later in the afternoon: "Since Maria's arrival at the hospital at approximately 10.45am this morning, she has been receiving the best medical attention possible at the hospital, which is the region's major trauma centre. Maria is conscious and medical assessments are ongoing. The team will await the outcome of these assessments before providing further comment. The team's first priority at this time is Maria and her family."De Villota was announced as Marussia's test driver in March, having prior experience driving for Alan Docking Racing in Superleague Formula in Spain.The mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia were just announced. Based on mythological characters, they are Miga, Quatchi and Sumi.Miga, a sea bear who lives in the ocean with her family pod near Tofino, and Quatchi, a young sasquatch, represent the Olympics, while Sumi represents the Paralympics that follow afterward.A sea bear is a First Nations creature, part killer whale, part Kermode spirit bear. While illustrated as being taller than the other characters, the mascot costume of Quatchi is the same height as the other two characters.The third mascot, Sumi, an animal-guardian spirit, is a Thunderbird that wears the hat of an orca. Sumi will be the mascot of the Paralympics.In 2004, the Times Colonist suggested a marmot might be a good mascot, except for their winter hibernation. The organizers still chose one, named Mukmuk, as their "virtual only" counterpart.After the Olympic logo design was leaked the day before the 2005 announcement, organizers were extremely tight lipped until today's news conference at a Surrey school. They apparently didn't do any development on the characters on internet-enabled computers, to ensure the images or information wouldn't slip out.The characters were designed by the Vancouver and Los Angeles-based Meomi Design. Their characters have been used as part of iGoogle, a customizable homepage option from Google, as well as Electronic Arts, Girls Inc., Time Out Magazine, Cyworld, Nick Jr., Bang-on Clothing, and CBC4Kids.The Vancouver organizers have a CDN$46-million merchandising program; previous Olympics have made as much as $100 million from mascot-related products.René Fasel, Chairman of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Coordination Commission commented that "The IOC welcomes these imaginative new additions to the Olympic Family as they take their place on the world stage today - a symbol of the Games and of Canada. We know that when Olympians, Paralympians and visitors from around the globe arrive in British Columbia at Games time, they will fall under the spell of these captivating characters."The characters first appearance will be at a Bay store in the Lower Mainland; HBC is a major sponsor of the Games. They will then make their way to schools, take a break through the Christmas season, and fly to Ottawa for the Winterlude festival.Brazilian driver Filipe Massa, driving for Ferrari, won the Brazilian Grand Prix at Autódromo José Carlos Pace in Interlagos, São Paulo. This is his second Grand Prix victory. Massa became the first Brazilian to win on home soil since Ayrton Senna in 1993. Massa started from pole and controlled the race from start to the finish line.Fernando Alonso finished second to win the drivers' championship. He became the youngest second-time champion. Alonso, along with the second Renault driver, Giancarlo Fisichella who finished sixth, won the constructors' cup for their team with only five points ahead of Ferrari. Jenson Button, one of Honda's drivers, finished behind Alonso.Michael Schumacher had a few problems this weekend. In the beginning of the third qualification session his car slowed down and forced him to start 10th on Sunday. In the race he was almost on the back of Fisichella, but damaged his tyre in the overtaking attempt and lose all positions. But the retiring champion was right on the back of Fisico for the second time near the end of the race. Giancarlo made a crucial mistake prior to Senna's "S"-curve allowing Michael to pass him. Next aim was Kimi Räikkönen, from McLaren-Mercedes, who lost his place to Schumacher in the same turn. Must note that all Schumacher overtook most of the other drivers in the same turn. The "Red Baron" set up the fastest time and the top speed record for this track. Let's say the words Nick Heidfeld, Sauber-BMW team driver, wrote on the back of his aerodynamical spoiler - "Danke, Michael!". Danke, Michael, for the fantastic race and so many seasons together. You overcomed the difficulties as the true champion.Kimi and Giancarlo finished 5-th and 6-th respectively.Rubens Barrichello (Honda, Pedro de la Rosa (McLaren-Mercedes) and Poland Robert Kubica (Sauber-BMW)were 7-th, 8-th and 9-th respectfully. Takuma Sato closed the season with 10-th place, first who finished in one lap after the winner, the best result for Super Aguri-Honda team.With ten laps to go, the most surprising event was Kimi's resistance when his open wheels untimely overlapped with Michael's, especially when one knows Kimi will run with Ferrari next season.Italy and Inter Milan defender Marco Materazzi revealed the slur he said to Zinedine Zidane at last year's FIFA World Cup in Germany, which led to Zidane's headbutting of Materazzi and subsequent red card for Zidane.Materazzi said in an interview with the TV Sorrisi e Canzoni magazine that the insult was: "I prefer the whore that is your sister." The Interview is set to be released on Monday.Materazzi had mentioned previously that the insult involved Zidane's sister, but had never given the exact words until now.On Monday, German football club FC Bayern Munich completed the signing of Mats Hummels, who captained Bayern's rivals Borussia Dortmund this past season. 27-year-old defender Hummels, who was an academy player at Bayern before moving to play for Borussia Dortmund, agreed to a five-year deal.Hummels underwent medical tests on Monday before signing the contract. Bayern's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said "We're delighted to welcome Mats back to FC Bayern, [...] Not only are we strengthening our squad with a world-class centre-back, but also with a player who accepts responsibility and who is our own youth product.

He played only one Bundesliga match for the Reds before he was loaned to Dortmund and later signed for them. He played his last game for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday in the DFB-Pokal Cup final, which Bayern won 4–3 on penalties.After the signing was completed, he said "Saying goodbye to Dortmund was difficult for me of course. It was similar to 2008, when it was the other way around [...] Now I'm looking forward to everything that awaits me at FC Bayern. I'm very excited." ((de))German language: ‍Der Abschied aus Dortmund ist mir natürlich schwergefallen. 2008 ging es mir ähnlich, als ich den Weg in die andere Richtung gemacht habe [...] jetzt freue ich mich einfach auf alles, was mich beim FC Bayern erwartet.

If they can't we will help them.  We must drastically change the training of our athletes, judging by what has happened in Vancouver."Medvedev added that "[f]or a long time we have benefited from Soviet achievements. At some point they ran out. We have lost the Soviet sports school, it is simply gone, but we have not formed our own system, even though the amount of money put out into sports was unprecedented. That means that money doesn't decide everything. Money is an important factor, but it does not decide everything."Russia finished the Olympics in eleventh place on the medals table, with three golds; at the 2006 Turin games, the country was in the top five, with eight golds and twenty-two overall medals. In Vancouver, the figure skaters did not receive any gold medals; in hockey, Russia lost 7-3 in quarterfinals to Canada, finishing out of the medals.Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also commented on the issue on Friday, two days before the closing ceremony of the Games.

The deal, which includes stadium naming rights, is worth more than $20 million annually, according to a baseball official.This tops the approximately ten million annually the NFL's Houston Texans receive from Reliant Energy to call their home Reliant Stadium.The agreement between the Mets and the financial services company includes options for both the team and Citigroup that could extend the deal to up to 35-years. Other commercial arrangements are part of the contract, the official said.Construction on the ballpark, next to the current stadium in Queens, New York, began last summer and is scheduled to be ready for the 2009 season. The Mets have played at Shea Stadium since 1964, the team's third year in the league. The ballpark is named for William A. Shea, a lawyer who helped bring National League baseball back to New York.The announcement will be made Monday at a special ceremony that will be attended by New York Govener, George Pataki and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Citigroup is one of the world's largest full-service banks, with two hundred million customers in more than 100 countries.Following recent news that Honda had withdrawn from Formula One in 2009, initial rumours that Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim has rescued the team appear to be false. Foxsports quotes a Telmex release as saying "The Telmex Team can confirm that Carlos Slim Helu has not bought the Honda F1 team nor is holding any negotiations to do so. Therefore all information related to this subject has no basis and is completely false."  Slim is the CEO and President of Telmex, a telecommunications provider in Mexico, and claims to be the world's second richest person.The initial reports suggested that a team had already been chosen including Jenson Button and rookie Bruno Senna as its drivers for 2009. Senna, who is the nephew of triple world champion Ayrton Senna, was said to be replacing veteran Rubens Barrichello. Slim is already sponsoring Senna through Embratel, one of his group's subsidiaries. Claims that Slim paid a visit to the Honda team facility in Northamptonshire in December also seem incorrect following a comment from team principal, Ross Brawn, in London's Daily Telegraph that "We would love it if it were true but it's pure speculation from various members of the media." A further quote stated that "It's just been one of those rumours which has developed a life of its own." Honda withdrew from Formula One recently following a 40% slump in its retail car sales and an estimated budget in excess of US$350m annually. The recent season was not successful for Honda which saw them finish ninth in the constructors' championship, only beating Team India and Super Aguri, who each failed to register a single championship point in 2008. Almost a week ago reports began circulating that Slim was interested and that other suitors may include Vijay Mallya and David Richards. Mallya took an active role in Formula One in 2008 with his purchase of the Spyker F1 team for US$130m. The first year was a tough one for Mallya and the team with constant failure to finish and not a single championship point gained. Richards is reported to have already met with potential investors in the Middle East. He has the experience as former team principal for BAR and Benetton Formula One motor racing teams.The Miami Heat beat the Dallas Mavericks by a score of 98-96 in the third game of the NBA Finals.

The race dips into Spain for some 50 kilometres at the summit, the fourth country visited in this year’s Tour. From there, there was little reprieve for the riders, hitting the Alto Laza and the Col de la Pierre St Martin (14.2 km climb at 5.2%) before descending to the start of the difficult, and very steep, first-category Col de Marie-Blanque (9.3 km climb at 7.4%). The riders then climb the infamous Col d'Aubisque (16.7 km climb at 7%), which will reward out-and-out climbing ability and punish the legs of all the major contenders.The entire Astana Team withdrew from the Tour prior to this stage due to Alexander Vinokourov testing positive for blood doping. Some riders staged a protest against doping at the start.Another doping scandal hit the Tour today. Cristian Moreni of Italy tested positive for testosterone in a test conducted after Thursday's stage 11. Moreni was questioned by police. Cofidis team manager Eric Boyer told Reuters: "He accepted his wrongdoing and did not ask for a B-sample."Like Astana did, Cofidis has withdrawn its entire team from the Tour. François Migraine, the team president and CEO of the sponsoring insurance company, Cofidis, said: "It's the only thing to do in such circumstances."Michael Rasmussen has won stage 8 of the 2007 Tour de France and has captured the overall lead. He blew away David Arroyo of Spain and Stéphane Goubert on the final climb. Iban Mayo took second. In the end, Arroyo and Goubert were overtaken by the chase group. Rasmussen, the Danish mountain specialist who has won the King of the Mountain's polka dot jersey the last two years, maximized the number of points he could collect in today's mountain stage.Michael Rogers of Australia had looked to be in position to take the yellow jersey, when he hit a barrier and hurt his wrist in the crash. Stuart O'Grady also crashed and is out, leaving only two Australians in the Tour.This, the third-shortest road stage in this year's Tour, was very tough. The climbing started from the outset, with two small climbs in the first 25 km. At 75 km out, the first big test was Cormet de Roselend (a 19 km climb at 6%). This was followed by the Montée d'Hauteville - the start of the Col du Petit Saint-Bernard - and the climb up to Tignes (18 km at 5.5%) for a very difficult finish at a height of 2068 m.Mark Cavendish of United Kingdom withdrew 35 km into today's stage. The sprinter had already planned to pull out, but not this soon.Stage 8 results Michael Rasmussen (Den / RAB ) 4 hrs 49 mins 40"Iban Mayo (Spa / SDV ) +2:47"Alejandro Valverde (Spa / CDE) +3:12"Christophe Moreau (Fra / AG2R ) +3:13"Fraenk Schleck (Lux / CSC ) s.t.Cadel Evans (Aus / PDL ) s.t.Andrey Kashechkin (Kaz / AST) s.t.Alberto Contador (Spa / DSC ) +3:31"Denis Menchov (Rus / RAB) +3:35"Carlos Sastre (Spa / CSC ) s.t.Overall classification Michael Rasmussen (Den / RAB) 39:37:42"Linus Gerdemann (Ger / TMO ) +43"Iban Mayo (Spa / SDV) +2:39"Alejandro Valverde (Spa / CDE) +2:51"Andrey Kashechkin (Kaz / AST) +2:52"Cadel Evans (Aus / PDL) +2:53"Christophe Moreau (Fra / AG2R ) +3:06"Alberto Contador (Spa / DSC) +3:10"Fraenk Schleck (Lux / CSC) +3:14"Denis Menchov (Rus / RAB) +3:19"Bologna, Italia - Michael Schumacher has set the Formula One pole record. "Schumi" won the pole position at the San Marino Grand Prix. The pole position was the 66th for Schumacher. Ayrton Senna held the previous record. Senna won his F1-career 65 pole positions between years 1984-1994. Schumacher has been racing in the F1-series since 1991. Senna won 40% of his pole attempts (161 races) compared to Schumacher's 28% (235 races so far). This new pole record reawakened the affection for Senna who died in 1994 on the fifth lap at the same race, the San Marino Grand Prix, a race won by Schumacher who was also champion the same year.Retired Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher has called off his return due to a neck injury. The German Ferrari driver announced his decision not to participate on his website. He said "Unfortunately we did not manage to get a grip on the pain in the neck which occurred after the private F1-day in Mugello."Schumacher who injured his neck in a bike accident in February aggravated his injury whilst trying out a 2007 F1 car as he was preparing for his comeback. The bike accident caused fractures in the area of head and neck which eventually turned out to be too severe for Formula 1 racing according to Schumacher. Ferrari President Luca di Montezemolo said. "I'm very sorry about the problem that will stop Michael returning to racing. His return would surely have done Formula 1 good and I'm certain we'd have seen him fighting for victory again." Schumacher who retired in 2006 after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times, was due to replace the injured Felipe Massa. The Brazilian suffered a serious head injury after a crash during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Massa is due to be out for at least the rest of the 2009 season. Test driver Luca Badoer is now due to replace Massa. Badoer competed in Formula 1 between 1993 and 1999. He holds the record for the most Formula 1 starts without scoring a single point at 49 starts.Seven-time world Formula One racing champion Michael Schumacher announced his plans to replace Felipe Massa in the second Ferrari car in the FIA Formula One 2009 European Grand Prix in Valencia, Spain.Massa was recently injured after a spring got loose from Rubens Barricello's car and hit his head in the Hungarian GP. Schumacher is expected to replace Massa for at least one Formula One event until the recovery of the Brazilian driver. Schumacher will get ready for his return using a special training program, checking his recovery after he fell off a motorcycle.The last time the "Red Baron" drove the Ferrari car was more than a year ago, in April 2008. If Schumacher starts in Valencia, it would be his first GP with Kimi Räikkönen as his team mate.Massa and Schumacher were team mates during the latter's last season and the two are said to be close friends. Massa was in a medically induced coma for several days but took his first steps today and can speak coherently; it was also confirmed today that he can still see out of both eyes. Concern does still remain about potential damage to his left eye. Massa was due to leave intensive care Wednesday and may be walking fully within ten days, although doctors remain cautious in their outlook for the Brazilian, who was runner-up in last year's season.There were different speculations about Massa's replacement: most notable and curious was that the double world championship winner Fernando Alonso was to negotiate with Ferrari after the Renault team was penalized to skip the GP on Alonso's home soil. Alonso was out of the recent Hungarian GP just after the first pit-stop cause of a loose wheel nut of the right front wheel. This incident not only stripped Renault of the possible podium finish, but also caused that penalty. To note, it was also the Hungarian GP of 2006 when Alonso was in the lead for most of the race, but ended it right after his pit-stop because off a badly attached right front wheel. That race was unexpectedly won by Jenson Button, who is now the championship leader.In other news related to Formula One BMW Sauber announced plans to retire from the sport at the end of this season. FOTA says it will try to help the team to stay in Formula One, which could possibly mean moves similar to those when Honda was withdrawn from Formula One at the end of the previous season.Seven-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher has awoken from a medically induced coma and left the hospital in Grenoble, France. Schumacher was induced after suffering severe head trauma following a skiing accident in the French Alps, December last year.Schumacher's manager, Sabina Kehm, has chosen not to reveal any more information about his rehabilitation, at the University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, due to concerns for his privacy."For the future we ask for understanding that his further rehabilitation will take place away from the public eye," Kehm said.The statement, released last Monday, was the first since April when it appeared that Schumacher had occasional moments of consciousness.Rehabilitation from head trauma of this level could take months or years to complete according to Neurosurgeon Tony Belli, who spoke to the BBC. "It depends very much on the severity of the injury, how young and fit they are." he said.Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the FIA Formula-1 2006 Sinopec Chinese Grand Prix on the Shanghai International Circuit. Although the wet weekend was more suitable for the Michelin-tyred cars, Schumacher overtook both Renault drivers to win the race.Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisicella started from the first line of the grid, but were unable to hold the old champion behind. The situation became irreversible after Alonso's second pit-stop, where he was delayed for more then ten seconds longer then usual because of the problems with the right rear wheel. After that, he pushed hard on the leaders, easily overtaking his teammate and closing the gap to the "Red Baron" to about 3 seconds for the final lap. Tough luck for Fernando, pit-stop problem spoiled a fantastic battle.The other battle for the fifth place involving two Honda's, Nick Heifeld, Takuma Sato (+1 lap) and Christijan Albers (+3 laps) took place on the last lap when the slight rain touches the track. After it the Honda team driver Rubens Barichello lose the nose of his car in a hit of BMW Sauber, while his teammate, Jenson Button, has secured his fourth place (Rubens was included in the final standings on the sixth place). Incident is currently under investigation by stewards - Sato and Albers could be penalized for ignoring waving blue flags.Felipe Massa, the second Ferrari driver, penalized for engine change, was out due to a collision with David Coulthard from the Red Bull team. McLaren-Mercedes driver Kimi Raikkonen was first to park his car on the side of the track once again due to technical problems, while his teammate Pedro de la Rosa managed a good result.This victory became 91st victory in Michael Schumacher's career. He regained two points more from Alonso in the drivers' championship - now they both have 116 points, though Renault team now returned the lead in the constructors' championship for just one point.Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the FIA Formula-1 French Grand Prix on the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours. With the help of a different pit-stop strategy Renault driver Fernando Alonso took second ahead of the other Ferrari of Felipe Massa. Massa had lead Alonso during the initial part of the race. Toyota did not live up to their promise in the qualifying session on Saturday with only one car finished, that of Ralf Schumacher. McLaren-Mercedes driver Kimi Raikkonen finished fifth. Pedro de la Rosa finished seventh. This was de la Rosa's first race this season. He had replaced Juan-Pablo Montoya in the McLaren hot seat, who left the team to start a career in NASCAR in the US.This victory is the 150-th podium finish for Michael Schumacher, and cut down Alonso's lead in the championship race to 17 points. It was his eighth French Grand Prix victory - the first driver to win a Grand Prix eight times, which surpassed his own record of seven.Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher and his teammate Felipe Massa won the first and second place on the FIA Formula-1 United States Grand Prix on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Schumacher became the winner on this track for the 5-th time.Renault driver Giancarlo Fisicella pushed hard on Ferrari's, but finished third. Fernando Alonso, his teammate, was only fifth.A major incident right after the start terminated the race for a number of drivers, including the only American Formula-1 driver Scott Speed and both the McLaren-Mercedes cars of Kimi Raikkonen and Juan-Pablo Montoya.Also tough luck for both MF1-Toyota team drivers, Tiago Monteiro, who collided with Japanese driver Takuma Sato, and Christijan Albers, who ended the race due to technical problems.The race ended with only nine cars finished, much better though, than a year before, when Michelin's tyre scandal broke.Michael Schumacher won the FIA Formula One Italian Grand Prix on the Autodromo Nazionale Monza racing track. The "Red Baron" passed the checkered flag and won the race, the 90th win in his long career. Kimi Räikkönen, the McLaren Mercedes driver started from pole, but was unable to keep up with Schumacher after the first pit-stop and finished second.As expected, Ferrari's winner spoke of his future in Formula One after the race. He announced that he will retire from Formula One as the man who wins the most than the other drivers - a true champion of this sport. He will surely struggle the last three races and it will be much easier because of a good standings in drivers' and constructors' championship.His closest competitor Fernando Alonso, the first Renault pilot, held an unbelievable race, but was out due to the engine failure 9 laps to go. He was heading for the third place. This closed his gap from Schumacher to the minimum of 2 points and allowed Ferrari to take the lead from Renault. Second Renault driver Giancarlo Fisichella finished fourth.A fantastic race for the first Poland Robert Kubica - BMW Sauber driver won his first podium. In the final protocol he placed himself third though started seventh. He replaced on the podium his co-driver Nick Heidfeld who started third, but finished eighth due to the penalty for speeding on the pit-lane and a failed start.Felipe Massa, who will replace Schumacher in Ferrari next year, had an extra pit-stop due to a tire problem thus allowed Kubica to end the race alone.Honda drivers managed two good results - Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello finished 5th and 6th, accordingly..This weekend the fifth Grand Prix weekend of the Formula 1 season, the Grand Prix of Europe, took place in Germany on the Nürburgring track. Unlike the previous race, Michael Schumacher was only second on the grid after qualifying on Saturday, losing out the pole position to Fernando Alonso, the first Renault pilot. However, in the last part of the race, "Schumi" outpaced Alonso on the track and took the lead thanks to some fast laps with the track free of traffic while Alonso took his final pitstop. The German passed the checkered flag and won for the 86th time in his Formula 1 career.In spite of his second "defeat", Fernando Alonso stands in the lead of the drivers championship, 13 points ahead his closest competitor, Michael Schumacher.Felipe Massa, the second Ferrari driver, was third. This achievement is the first podium of his Formula 1 career. Kimi Räikkönen struggled with the car this weekend, but ended up finishing the weekend with a fourth place. Kimi pushed hard on the closing laps and closed the gap to Felipe Massa to +0.4 seconds upon crossing the finish line.Nico Rosberg, the "discovery of the season", had a nice race for the Williams Formula 1 team. He finished 7th.After testing positive for marijuana amid the latest drug test, former NFL star Michael Vick was placed under tighter restrictions by U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson.Vick must be home between between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and he must submit to random drug tests that will be conducted in the future.Hudson also ordered that Vick may have to attend and pay for inpatient or outpatient substance therapy and mental health counseling if a supervising officer deems so.A document filed in U.S. District Court today said Vick tested positive amid a urine sample that was submitted on September 13, 2007.Vick is scheduled for sentencing on December 10 for bankrolling a dogfighting operation on his property.The Indianapolis Formula One Grand Prix descended into farce when just six cars started the race on Sunday. The problem arose when Michelin discovered that its tires were incapable of more than ten laps at race pace.The first indication of trouble was when the rear left tire of Ralf Schumacher's  Toyota racecar exploded during practice on Friday. Schumacher's car collided with the track wall while travelling at 300 km/h (approx. 186 miles/h), leaving him shaken but generally unharmed. However, further investigations by Michelin revealed that another ten tires had suffered problems, with one also failing on track.All the problems occurred on the rear left tire during the two long 90 degree corners leading onto the main straight. The nine degree banking and grooves cut into the surface of the track compounded problems.It is believed that Michelin may not have properly accounted for the grooves cut into the Indianapolis track to improve grip for Indy cars after the track was resurfaced. Indy cars have smaller down-force generating wings so need more grip from their tires than Formula One cars.Bridgestone, the other tire manufacturer currently in Formula One, did not have similar problems. It is possible that their US subsidiary, Firestone, who supplied tires for an Indy car race after the resurfacing, may have sent information back to their Formula One tires department in Japan. The three teams running Bridgestone tires - Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi - were therefore able to compete without any safety concerns.Under FIA racing regulations, the only course of action was for the Michelin runners to withdraw from the race on safety grounds. Rules prevented alternative tires from being flown from France overnight, although Michelin were unsure whether these tires were also affected by the problem.Drivers and teams had also suggested building a chicane to slow cars down between the corners, but Ferrari opposed the idea, and ultimately the FIA rejected the idea under regulations.Actually the FIA rules states that the tyres manufacters should provide two sets of tyres for the race. One normal, optimized for performance, and one optimized for safety, to be used when the normal one set could not be used. In this case the safe set was not present.The 123,000 fans watching from the stands were unaware of the farce unfolding below them until the parade lap before the race.The fourteen Michelin runners peeled off into the pit lane rather than take up their starting positions on the grid. However, at least one driver, David Coulthard told his team that he was willing to race on the tires in question, had the decision been left up to him.Fans jeered and booed as they realised what was happening, and a small number began throwing bottles and cans onto the track.Rubens Barrichello, in a Ferrari, ran over one bottle of water at high speed which exploded in a spray of droplets.Fans started stamping in the stands on the finish line straight, causing them to shake.A British ITV filmcrew spoke to some fans. "I paid $85 for three-day ticket. I travelled nine hours from Baltimore to be here. Indy cars wouldn't do this. NASCAR wouldn't do this. I'll never attend a race again - only watch on TV."Other fans had travelled from Mexico and Panama to watch the race, and said they wanted refunds.A Police Captain also talked to ITV, saying he'd never seen fans as angry as this before. If trouble flared, they could call on 400-500 officers from local and state police, Indianapolis Police Department and the FBI under contingency plans.The race was eventually won by Michael Schumacher from his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello. Jordan's Tiago Monteiro finished third. Despite what was clearly a one-manufacturer race for the win, both Ferrari drivers did indeed race one another hard, with them almost colliding following Schumacher's exit from the pit lane after his second pitstop, with Barrichello having to take to the infield to avoid spinning off. Following the race, the two drivers did not speak.Michelle Kwan, a figure skater on the United States Olympic team, has pulled out of the Olympic Games because of a groin injury.  According to a newsbreak bulletin on NBC, she injured her right hip abductor muscle in a fall during practice on Saturday.  The muscle pain continued to worsen and at 2:45am she went to the team doctor.  The team doctor determined this was a serious injury and Michelle made the decision to pull out of the Olympics and give the alternate Emily Hughes the chance to skate.  Emily Hughes was contacted at 8:45pm Eastern time that she would be needed at the Games.  She is scheduled to fly to Italy on Sunday.  Emily Hughes is the younger sister of Olympic medalist Sarah Hughes.U.S. golfer Michelle Wie made the cut yesterday in the 2006 SK Telecom Open in Inchon, South Korea, finishing the second round with a 3-under-par 69 and 5-under-par overall, tying her for 17th overall.This was Wie's eighth attempt at making it past the halfway point in a men's professional golf tournament.  She had played in seven tournaments on the PGA, Canadian, Nationwide, and Japanese tours, failing to make the 36-hole cut in all seven attempts.The 16-year old golfer from Hawaii became the second woman to accomplish this feat in a Korean men's tournament, after Se Ri Pak made the cut in the 2003 SBS Pro-Golf Championship and went on to finish 10th.Renowned University of Michigan college football coach Bo Schembechler, died Friday at the age of 77.Schembechler collapsed at the studios of WXYZ-TV after taping a TV show on the eve of the Wolverines' No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown with perennial rival Ohio State. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he died at 11:42 a.m. "The electrical part of the heart was working fine but the mechanical part was not working," said Dr. Shukri David, the head of cardiology at Providence Hospital. "The heart was sending signals to the heart muscle to contract. The muscle was not responding."Schembechler had a heart attack on the eve of his first Rose Bowl in 1970 and another one in 1987. He had two quadruple heart-bypass operations, and doctors implanted a pacemaker to regulate his heartbeat after he became ill during a taping at WXYZ on Oct. 20."This is a tremendous shock and an irreplaceable loss," University of Michigan president Mary Sue Coleman said at a news conference at Providence Hospital in Southfield, where the coach died.The seven-time Big Ten coach of the year compiled a 194-48-5 record at Michigan from 1969-89. Schembechler's record in 26 years of coaching was 234-65-8.London, England — At the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) press conference Monday, Sir Philip Craven indicated the goal of the IPC is to grow disability sport globally. At the same time, according to Paul Bird of the Oceania Paralympic Committee, the Micronesian of Oceania has been left completely behind by the Paralympic movement.According to a member of the Oceania Paralympic Committee, the IPC recognizes fewer countries than the International Olympic Committee, with IPC rules prohibiting countries from becoming full members of the organization if their independence is not clear. This rule dates back to the organization's founding and no serious attempts have been made to change it since.  As many Micronesian countries are not viewed as independent countries, they cannot join.  This includes Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The only eligibility route for elite athletes with disabilities in these countries to the Paralympic Games is through their home country, which for most of the Micronesian region is the United States; they have to compete against better-funded and better-supported competitors to earn national team selection. No disability sport competitors from Micronesia were chosen to represent the United States at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.This problem is not unique to Micronesia, with the United States territories of Puerto Rico and United States Virgin Islands not being represented as members of the United States team in 2012.US racing driver and Carmichael, California native Bryan Clauson died Sunday night from injuries sustained after a crash during Saturday's Belleville Midget Nationals quarter midget race in Kansas. He was 27 years old.On lap 14 of the race, Clauson took the lead when he collided with a lapped car in turn four and hit the track's guardrail. The contact forced his car into a roll, landing on its side, where it was struck by Ryan Greth's car. The race was suspended under a red flag as track workers removed Clauson from his vehicle, a process that took 30 minutes to complete. He was airlifted to Bryan Medical Center West in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he was reported to be in critical condition. On Monday, Clauson's family released a statement to United States Auto Club (USAC) officials announcing Clauson had died from his injuries. USAC CEO Kevin Miller stated, "This is truly one of the darkest days in the 60-year history of the United States Auto Club. Not only have we lost one of our greatest USAC champions, we've lost a true ambassador for all of motorsports."The race was the 116th of the year for Clauson as part of a campaign known as the Circular Insanity Tour, in which he attempted to run 200 races in 2016. Entering the Belleville Nationals, he had won 27 feature races. He was a three-time USAC National Midget and two-time USAC National Sprint Car champion with over 170 wins in USAC-sanctioned events, including a Chili Bowl Nationals win in 2014. He competed in stock car racing, driving in NASCAR and the ARCA Racing Series, winning a race in the latter. He ran 26 Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) races in 2007 and 2008 for Chip Ganassi Racing, recording a best finish of fifth at Kentucky Speedway in 2008. In 2008, he attempted three Sprint Cup Series races for Ganassi, but failed to qualify for all three. Clauson also ran three Indianapolis 500 events, one of which included the 100th running in 2016, where he finished 23rd.In the previous night's race, Clauson crashed into Morgan Frewaldt's car in a similar location to his accident on Saturday. Clauson's team reported he was sore after the impact, but he tweeted his thanks to his safety equipment and chassis manufacturer for keeping him safe. He is survived by his parents, Tim and Diana, his sister, Taylor and his fiancé, Lauren Stewart.Mike Ashley, the owner of English football club Newcastle United F.C., has taken the club off the market for a second time, after failing to concluded several negotiations, including a cash offer of £80 million, according to the club.A club statement said of the move:"Mike Ashley is totally committed to the future success of Newcastle United and will be focused on gaining promotion back to the Premier League. Mike will put a further £20m into the club this week." This is the second time Ashley has taken the club off the market after putting it up for sale. This season, Newcastle are competing in the Football League Championship, the second tier of English football, after relegation from the top flight Premier League at the end of last season. Ashley had bought the Premier League club in May 2007 for £134.4m, but after a difficult period of ownership, which saw the return and departure of manager Kevin Keegan after a few months, and after fan protests, Ashley eventually put the club up for sale for the first time in September 2008. In a statement at the time he said:I am not stupid and have listened to the fans. I have really loved taking my kids to the games, being next to them and all the fans. But I am now a dad who can't take his kids to a football game on a Saturday because I am advised that we would be assaulted. Therefore, I am no longer prepared to subsidise Newcastle United. I am putting the club up for sale. I hope that the fans get what they want and that the next owner is someone who can lavish the amount of money on the club that the fans want. After failing to find a suitable buyer, Ashley took the club off the market in December 2008, stating he is "committing to the club as its owner". After a poor season, culminating in relegation from the Premier League to the Football Championship for the first time in 16 years, Ashley put the club up for sale a second time after relegation in May 2009. Ashley stated of the situation "It's been catastrophic for everybody. I've lost my money and made terrible decisions".The announcement came on the same day as it announced Chris Hughton as the club's permanent manager, and that the club would be putting the naming rights of the club stadium St James' Park up for offers next season.Mike Tyson's boxing career appears to be over after the infamous fighter became fatigued against his journeyman opponent Saturday.  Tyson later told the media he was quitting the sport to become a missionary.Despite being heavily favored, the 38-year old Tyson became desperate in the sixth round and resorted to his trademark bizarre tactics against Irishman Kevin McBride (33-4-1). When an attempt to break his opponent's arm failed to end the fight, Tyson landed a head-butt that opened a cut near McBride's left eye.   Still desperate and low on stamina, Tyson proceeded to hit below the belt before sagging to the canvas in the closing seconds of the round.  When Tyson refused to answer the bell for the seventh, veteran referee Joe Cortez "looked stunned," according to the Boston Globe's Ron Borges. Tyson led on two cards and trailed on a third when the fight was called, but he was clearly out of gas and momentum was not with him. "I do not have the stomach for this," Tyson told Showtime interviewer Jim Gray after leaving the ring. "I don't have the guts to be in this sport anymore. My heart is not into this anymore."  He also apologized to the 15,472 paid attendance at the MCI Center "whom had roared his name when he entered the ring less than an hour earlier," according to Borges.The $5 million payday will erase only a fraction of an enormous debt that caused Tyson to declare bankruptcy in 2003.  One report says he owes more than $40 million [1].The disgraced former champion also told reporters he is "going to look into my missionary work," according to Reuters.  "There is some Christian missionary work that was interested in letting me come to Bosnia, go to Rwanda, go to different countries to help with aid and food for people that are in dire need."Police Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon has warned of an increase in police and military activity in Melbourne, Australia, in preparation for the Commonwealth Games. Officials say a major security sweep of Melbourne is underway at the athletes' village.A 24-hour temporary police station inside the 20-hectare Parkville site will be staffed by 109 officers. The station will house a monitoring centre for the village's closed-circuit TV network. Melbourne's newest police station, keeping tabs on nearly 6000 athletes and officials from 71 countries will operate for seven weeks.Ms Nixon said people should not be alarmed. "They will be seeing, over the next month or two, an increase in some air activity and perhaps military on the streets coming into place for the support they'll give to the Games." Commissioner Nixon says the defence forces have an important role to play. "You won't certainly see an armed soldier walking down the streets of Melbourne, that's not the security level that we have and the presence that we need," she said. "Military will be there, they'll be checking trucks and cars going into venues, they'll be doing all of that."More than 150 Defence Force personnel and police moved on to the village site on Tuesday. Games Minister Justin Madden said the sweep would continue until athletes arrived at the village on March 5. Sweeps of all venues will take place before the Games begin.More than 1200 defence staff have been seconded to the Games security team. F/A-18 Hornets and Black Hawk helicopters will enforce a 75km no-fly zone around the MCG. Every vehicle that enters the village - and every other venue - will have to first pass through a bomb search bay that includes X-ray machines. Army security sweeps are continuing across all venues. These, combined with comprehensive bag and personal checks at Games time, are seen as the best way to guard against a terrorist strike."If people ring up and say, 'Oh look, there's a bomb in it', we'll be pretty much able to say 'no, there's not'," Commissioner Nixon said. While security is being stepped up at the village, Ms Nixon said there is no direct threat to the Games overall. "We have a medium-level of security at these Games," she said. "The risk assessment is we have no direct threat to the Games, no evidence at all."The Victorian Government has declared Birrarung Marr, Alexandra Gardens, Albert Park and the Yarra River to be official Games venues, giving police the power to enforce tough anti-protest laws. A similar ruling on Yarra Park - home to the MCG - will also come into effect.Games laws provide for fines of $2000 for offences such as blocking access, erecting signs, kicking stones or throwing missiles in "venues".An United States man from Tulsa, Oklahoma, was killed by a baseball during a game in North Little Rock, Arkansas, against the Arkansas Travelers. Tulsa Drillers coach Mike Coolbaugh, 35, was struck and killed by a line drive while coaching first base. He leaves his wife, Mandy, and two young sons, Jacob and Joseph. Mandy is expecting a daughter who is to be named "Mandy" as well. Coolbaugh spent seventeen years in professional baseball. He played Major League Baseball for two seasons and Minor League Baseball for the remainder, before becoming a coach.Coolbaugh was coaching first base in the ninth inning, when a line drive off the bat of Tino Sanchez struck Coolbaugh in the head causing him to lose consciousness. CPR was administered on the field. An ambulance transported Coolbaugh to Baptist Medical Center where he fell into respiratory arrest. He later died at the hospital at 10:47 p.m.The game was then called off in the ninth inning with the Drillers behind 7-3.

Capitalizing on its successful debut a year ago at the private residence of Playboy founder Hugh Heffner, Strikeforce at the Mansion II was an invitation-only event where elite guests were treated to a wine tasting and gourmet buffet dinner before the show, with the fight being carried live on pay-per-view. There were nine fights on the card scheduled for the evening.  The first round of the main event saw very little action as Misaki and Riggs were feeling each other out. Fans expressed their displeasure over the lack of action. A pair of low kicks by Misaki put him ahead in the scoring 10-9 after the first round. The second round saw the action open up. Misaki started to throw more punches and combinations in the first minute, with Riggs blocking most of the blows and only offering a timid response. Riggs found an opening after a straight left, and followed it up with another powerful left punch that stunned Misaki. Misaki immediately got to his feet and answered with a right cross punch that knocked Riggs staggering backwards. Misaki quickly jumped on Riggs and pummeled him with punches, with Riggs covering up to block them. The controversy came several seconds later as referee Josh Rosenthal stopped the fight, awarding the win to Kazuo Misaki at 2:29 of Round Two by technical knockout (TKO) due to unanswered repeated strikes. In an interview with MMA Weekly, Rosenthal said that he warned Riggs three times that he needed to advance his defensive position, but he failed to do so. Riggs, upset by the stoppage, said in an interview, "I'm really upset, I thought it was an early stoppage. That's twice Josh Rosenthal's fucked me over, first with Alex Stiebling, now with Misaki." Misaki said in his post-fight interview that he didn't feel qualified to comment on whether the stoppage was premature. Full results of the evening's card: Kazuo Misaki (21-8-2) def. Joe Riggs (28-11-0) by TKO (unanswered repeated strikes) at 2:29 of Round 2Josh Thomson (16-2-0) def.

The Chiefs are now in a three-way tie for the sixth AFC wildcard spot with the San Diego Chargers, who lost to the Miami Dolphins, and the Cincinnati Bengals, who won against the Cleveland Browns.The Chiefs face the New York Giants next Saturday and the Cowboys play the Washington Redskins on Sunday.In association football signings this week, on Wednesday English football club Manchester United F.C. announced the signing of Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan from German club Borussia Dortmund; and on Thursday Spanish club Málaga CF announced signing striker Sandro Ramírez from FC Barcelona.Alex Rodriguez's home run streak was extended Tuesday in the Yankee's win over the Twins in Minneapolis. A-Rod hit a two-run shot off of Twins starter Boof Bonser in the first inning, making it the fourth game in a row that he has cleared the fence. Bonser gave up six hits and seven runs in the four and one third innings he pitched, including a Johnny Damon three-run homer over the right field wall in the fifth inning. before being relieved by Jesse Crain. Dennys Reyes pitched the final inning, giving up three runs to bring the Yankee's lead to nine runs.Andy Pettitte threw six shutout innings, allowing only four hits. Minnesota's only run came from a Jason Kubel sacrifice fly in the seventh inning, scoring Justin Morneau from third base. The Twins had many opportunities to score early, but ended up leaving their runners in scoring position without any hits to bring them home.The Twins and Yankees will wrap up the series tomorrow, each hoping for a win to stay above .500. Mike Mussina will be starting for the Yanks, and Ramon Ortiz will be starting for the Twins.Yesterday San Francisco Giants LF Barry Bonds hit a 435-foot home run, his 756th, off a pitch from Mike Bacsick of the  Washington Nationals, breaking the all-time career home run record, formerly held by Hank Aaron.The pitch, the seventh of the at-bat, was a 3-2 pitch, which Bonds hit into the right-center field bleachers. Matt Murphy, a 22-year-old from Queens in New York City, got the ball and was promptly protected and escorted away from the mayhem by a group of San Francisco police officers.After Bonds finished his home-run trot, a ten-minute delay in the game marked the occasion. This included a brief video by Aaron congratulating Bonds on breaking the record which Aaron had held for 33 years. An impromptu emotional statement by Bonds on the field, with Willie Mays at his side, followed."I move over now and offer my best wishes to Barry and his family on this historic achievement," said Aaron in his video-taped statement, which was played on the scoreboard.After the game Bacsik said of Bonds, "He's the greatest of all time ... Giving it up to Barry Bonds is nothing to be ashamed of."Speculation about banned, performance-enhancing drugs have followed Bonds in recent years. But he said to his critics, "This record is not tainted at all -- at all. Period." He also said to reporters, "You guys can say whatever you want."Pitcher Josh Hancock passed away early Sunday after crashing his car into a tow truck. The accident occurred on Interstate 64 in St. Louis, Missouri at about 12:30am, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He was 29 years old.Josh Hancock was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 1998 and made his Major League debut in 2002. He was later traded to the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds before being signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006. He was part of the 2006 World Series Cardinals team, and a current member of the Cardinals roster. He had just played in Saturday afternoon's game against the Chicago Cubs, pitching three solid innings.Hancock was mourned around the league. The Cleveland Indians held a moment of silence before their game, displaying Hancock's picture on the scoreboard. Bud Selig, Commissioner of Major League Baseball, said "All of baseball today mourns the tragic and untimely death of St. Louis pitcher Josh Hancock. He was a fine young pitcher who played an important role on last year's World Series championship team."This is the second time in recent years that a Cardinals pitcher has died during the regular season. In 2002, Darryl Kile was found dead in his room at the team's hotel during a series against the Cubs in Chicago, Illinois. The final game of the Cardinals-Cubs series, scheduled for 7:00pm tonight, has been postponed because of the tragedy.The Houston Astros have fired manager Phil Garner and general manager Tim Purpura less than two years after leading the team to its first World Series appearance (2005).Bench coach Cecil Cooper was appointed interim manager and team president Tal Smith will serve as interim general manager."I felt this was the time for a change," owner Drayton McLane said. "I just think we needed a fresh start."Garner took over the Astros in the middle of the 2004 season after Jimy Williams was fired. The Astros went 48-26 in the second half and won 36 of their last 46 games to win the NL wild card, then defeated Atlanta in the first round of the playoffs before losing to St. Louis in Game 7 of the NL Championship Series.Garner managed Milwaukee from 1992-99 and Detroit from 2000-02. He has a 985-1,054 career record as a major league manager, including 277-252 with the Astros.Purpura joined the organization in 1994 and directed player development and the Astros' six minor league affiliates before taking over from Gerry Hunsicker as GM before the 2005 season.The Astros are currently in fifth place in the National League Central with a record of 58-73.American Major League Baseball relief pitcher Joba Chamberlain of the New York Yankees returned a call to his sister after an 8-5 loss to the Boston Red Sox Sunday night. After speaking with his sister who was in Lincoln, Nebraska, he was in tears and being consoled by manager Joe Girardi.Joba's father, Harlan Chamberlain, 55, collapsed at his home in Lincoln, and is currently at St. Elizabeth Regional Medical Center.  Although the exact nature of his collapse is unknown, Harlan, a full-blooded Winnebago Native American, has struggled with post-polio syndrome since childhood.  He has been known to be in declining health in recent years.Still, Harlan was in attendance at Yankee Stadium during the team's Opening Day series this year.  He also drove down to Kansas City, only three hours away from Lincoln, when the Yankees visited the Kansas City Royals.  He made the same trips last year when Joba made his much-anticipated Major League debut.When asked about the situation, Girardi only said, "Personal stuff stays in [the clubhouse]."Joba has been granted leave from the team to be with his father, and will not be with the Yankees at least during their two-game series against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.The New York Mets hosted the Chicago Cubs at Shea Stadium in Flushing, New York, and was behind by five runs going into the ninth inning, but a rally brought them ahead at the end.Cub starter Ángel Guzmán gave up six hits, but only allowed one run in his seven inning appearance, an RBI single by Endy Chávez in the fifth inning. Mets starter Jason Vargas gave up all five of the Cubs' runs: a sacrifice fly RBI in the fourth, and two two-run home runs in the sixth inning. Angel Pagán hit his second home run of the season with a two-run fly ball over the left field fence, scoring Endy Chávez. Two batters later, Aramis Ramírez picked up his tenth home run of the season with a two run line drive over the same fence, scoring Alfonso Soriano.Cub pitcher Ryan Dempster got stuck in a jam in the bottom of the ninth, filling the bases and giving up two runs. Reliever Scott Eyre came in to try and end the game, but gave up two hits, including the two-run single by Carlos Delgado that gave the Mets not only their first lead of the game, but the win.The Mets, who took the four-game series 3-1, are playing an inter-league game against the New York Yankees in a three-game "subway series" starting Friday. Meanwhile, the Cubs are preparing for their own inter-city, inter-league game at Wrigley Field against the Chicago White Sox.The Pittsburgh Pirates swept the Houston Astros in a 5-4 victory at the Minute Maid Park Wednesday. Xavier Nady did very well in the first three games of the season, going 1 for 4 with 2 runs to lift the Pirates over the Astros. Tom Gorzelanny made his debut in the last game of the series, giving up 3 runs on 7 hits, with 2 errors, with one ball batted and four strikeouts. This is the first time since May 1991 that the Pirates swept the Astros.Trailing by two runs in the fifth, Pittsburgh capitalized on three fielding errors to put them ahead by two. Craig Biggio hit a solo home run with two outs in the ninth inning, but Pittsburgh closer Salomon Torres struck out the last batter and picked up the save.The Astros are off until Friday when the St. Louis Cardinals visit for three games. Meanwhile, the Pirates are concluding their opening road trip in Cincinnati before returning home to face the Cardinals.The Texas Rangers rounded the bases at a dizzying pace and became the first team in 110 years to score 30 runs in a game, setting an American League record Wednesday in a 30-3 rout of the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards. It was the ninth time a major league team scored 30 runs, the first since the Chicago Colts set the major league mark in a 36-7 rout of Louisville in a National League game on June 28, 1897, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.Hours after announcing manager Dave Trembley would return for the 2008 season, the Orioles absorbed the most lopsided loss in franchise history and set a team record for hits allowed in a game (29). The Rangers set a team record for runs scored in a doubleheader -- before the second game even started. Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ramon Vasquez, the bottom two batters in Texas' lineup, each homered twice and finished with seven RBIs.Texas had 57 at-bats, tying the AL record for a nine-inning game set by Milwaukee in its 1992 rout of Toronto. The Rangers added five points to their team batting average, raising it to .258. They finished with more runs than outs made (27). Baltimore went from seventh in the AL with a 4.39 ERA to 11th at 4.60.Wes Littleton entered the game in relief for Texas in the last of the seventh, with his team already ahead 14-3. He earned a save by pitching for at least three innings, shutting out the Orioles in the final three innings while his teammates scored another 16 insurance runs.In game two of the doubleheader series, the Rangers again defeated the Orioles, but by a score of 9-7.Left-handed pitcher Tom Glavine of the New York Mets MLB team won his 300th career game. Glavine pitched 6 1/3 innings allowing six hits, one walk, two runs (both earned) and struck out one. He became only the 23rd pitcher in professional baseball history to win 300 games. He is now 3rd in wins among active MLB pitchers behind only Greg Maddux and Roger Clemens. He also is 5th in wins all time among left-handed pitchers. Glavine allowed one run in the 6th and left after one out in the seventh inning with a runner on base that eventually scored.The Cleveland Indians pulled off a stunning win late in the game at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Thursday, defeating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Travis Hafner, in the bottom of the eighth, hit a three run homer to erase the one score lead of the Angels. Orlando Cabrera was the only angel for the Angels as he had three hits on four at bats with two runs scored.Pitching for Cleveland was pretty solid as Jeremy Sowers pitched seven innings, with one run on six hits with 27 at bats, one error, and three strikeouts. No home runs were give up by any of the four pitchers(Jeremy Sowers, Roberto Hernandez, Aaron Fultz and Joe Borowski) for Cleveland.The same couldn't be said for the Angels pitchers squad, though. Dustin Moseley started for the LA Angels pitching six innings, allowing one run on five hits with 24 at bats, one error, three strikeouts, and one home run given up. It was not Dustin Moseley who gave up the game winning three run homer, but Scot Shields, the relief pitcher who let the game slide.Aaron Fultz was the winning pitcher for the game, his second win of the young season. Scot Shields was saddled with his first loss of the season. The save was credited to closer Joe Borowski. The game was played in Milwaukee due to the snow storm in Cleveland the previous weekend.Cleveland's next game will be a home game (this time in Cleveland) against the Chicago White Sox at 7:05 tonight, the first of a three game series. As the Angels well face the Boston Red Sox at 4:05 tonight, the first of a four game series.After two games into the season, the Minnesota Twins are the sole leader of the American League Central division, something they couldn't accomplish last year until an hour after their final game ended. The Twins, now 2-0, defeated the Baltimore Orioles Tuesday night at the Metrodome.

Chad Bradford pitched a third of an inning.Baltimore struck first, with Melvin Mora hitting a solo home run in the top of the third. Later in the third inning, Oriole Aubrey Huff hit an RBI single to score Nick Markakis from second base.Orioles shortstop Miguel Tejada made an amazing defensive play in the fourth inning, diving to grab a line drive and setting up a double play. The same play also led to the Twins' first run with Nick Punto scoring on the sacrifice. The Twins tied the game in the fifth when Luis Castillo hit to the pitcher, but the ball bounced out of Cabrera's glove, scoring Torii Hunter from third base. The tie would remain until the seventh inning when Jason Bartlett hit a single to left, scoring Jason Tyner from second base.The Minnesota Twins swept the Baltimore Orioles in a 7-2 victory at the Metrodome Wednesday. Ramón Ortiz made an impressive Twins debut, giving up only two runs in seven innings of play and picking up the win. This was the first time Minnesota has swept a series with the Orioles at home since they faced them in May 1994, and their first 3-0 start since 2003.Baltimore pitcher Jaret Wright made his debut for the Orioles Wednesday, but he gave up six runs (four earned) and five walks in less than three innings. Oriole fielders were charged with three errors. This was the first time Baltimore has started the season 0-3 since 1995.Twins got things started early, with Michael Cuddyer hitting in Nick Punto in both the first and third innings. Rondell White got his first hit of the season and picked up two RBIs. Luis Castillo, who hit in the Twins the winning run on Tuesday picked up two RBIs as well. In the fifth inning, Jason Kubel hit in Torii Hunter, making the score 7-0.Baltimore attempted a rally in the sixth inning, Melvin Mora and Miguel Tejada hitting in a run each, but the pitching by Ortiz and the Twins' defense held them to only two runs.Cuddyer left the game following the fourth inning after being hit by a bouncing foul ball in the chin. He was given five stitches and is expected to be ready to play on Friday when the team travels to Chicago to face the White Sox. Baltimore will head to New York to face the Yankees after their off day.In the course of the game, reliever Joe Nathan became a father for a second time, his wife giving birth to his son Riley. Nathan, being allowed to miss the game, left the hospital shortly after the birth to attend the final inning. He was able to congratulate his team immediately following their win, while being congratulated himself.The Minnesota Twins lit a fire in front of a sold-out Metrodome crowd during Monday's season opener against the Baltimore Orioles. The fans came to cheer on the 2006 American League Central Division champions and remember veteran radio broadcaster Herb Carneal who passed away a day ago.Orioles starter Erik Bedard pitched five innings, giving up ten hits and six runs, including back-to-back home runs in the second inning to reigning American League MVP Justin Morneau and outfielder Torii Hunter. Twins starter Johan Santana give up seven hits and four runs in six innings, including a home run to Miguel Tejada in the fifth inning. Twins closer Joe Nathan picked up his first save of 2007.The Twins players sported black armbands to honor Carneal, and a tribute was shown prior to the game to honor the legendary broadcaster. Between innings, people spoke about their memories of Carneal. This is the first time since 1978 that the Baltimore Orioles have started their season away from home.The Minnesota Twins faced the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park Friday in a AL Central Division match-up. Twins starting pitcher Ramon Ortiz gave up five hits and two runs in the six innings he pitched. Tigers starter Nate Robertson allowed one run in seven innings, but was charged with the two runners that scored for the Twins in the eighth inning.The Tigers pounced in the third inning; Carlos Guillen singled scoring the veteran Gary Sheffield. The Tigers would add one in the sixth with a Craig Monroe double, scoring Sean Casey. The Twins would get on the board in the seventh inning, with the lead off hitter Justin Morneau sending his first pitch over the left field fence.But the Twins would rally with a four-run eighth inning, which started with a Mike Redmond single, driving in two runs to tie the game at 3-3. Joe Mauer, who wasn't scheduled to play, pinch hit in the DH spot and brought in the go-ahead run, plus one, giving the Twins a two-run lead. Joe Nathan picked up the save, his seventh of the season.The middle game of this three-game series will be played tomorrow at noon in Detroit. Starting for Detroit will be Justin Verlander, and Carlos Silva will start for Minnesota.The Minnesota Twins, after suffering a cold loss at an even colder U.S. Cellular Field to the Chicago White Sox on Saturday, needed to heat up their offense for the final game of the series, and with help from Cy Young winner Johan Santana and AL MVP Justin Morneau, they did just that.Starting pitcher Santana started slow, giving up an unusual three walks in the first couple innings, but turned things around after that, giving up just one hit in seven innings pitched, and throwing nine strikeouts. White Sox starter John Danks struck out six, but gave up 4 of the Twins' six hits, plus a three-run homer off the bat of Justin Morneau in the fourth.The White Sox would respond by hitting a home run of their own, a solo shot off the bat of Juan Uribe in the eighth inning, but the Twins would hold them to just that one run, as closer Joe Nathan picked up the save.Friday's postponed game will likely be rescheduled for the weekend of July 6, the next time the Twins play the White Sox in Chicago.The White Sox, now 2-3, are hitting the road to Oakland for a three-game series against the Athletics starting tomorrow. The White Sox are 4-23 in the past six years at the McAfee Coliseum, and hope their starting pitcher Jose Contreras will bounce back after a rough opening day loss.The Twins, now 4-1, will head back to Minneapolis to face the Yankees, with Sidney Ponson making his debut for the Twins.Major League Baseball is moving the upcoming Anaheim Angels at Cleveland Indians series to Miller Park in Milwaukee after snow and cold has led to the cancellation of the Tribe's four-game home opener against the Seattle Mariners at Jacobs Field. The games, which were rescheduled to be played in double-headers on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, will need to be made-up later this season. A venue change was needed to prevent more postponed games; cold temperatures in Cleveland are forecasted throughout the week, and precipitation is expected Wednesday.The snow started falling Friday, the day of the Indians home opener against the Mariners, and never let up. After three "snow delays", the game was postponed, just one out away from being considered an "official game". The ground crew has been working nonstop, on Saturday clearing 10 inches off the field only to have it begin to snow heavily just hours before the game, leading to another postponement.Further complicating matters is the fact that Seattle is not scheduled to return to Cleveland during the regular season, so make-up games would need to be played during the teams' off-days. The Tribe, who haven't played since Wednesday's loss to the White Sox, haven't been resting either. All players reported Sunday for indoor practice. Cleveland outfielder David Dellucci said "I've been trying to get a partner to play long toss on the field, and nobody wants to throw with me. I think this is the first time in my career I've wanted to throw and no one wanted to. Usually, it's the other way around."It was an unusual ending to Thursday's game at U.S. Cellular Field between the Chicago White Sox and the Cleveland Indians. With the game tied in the bottom of the ninth inning, Cleveland pitcher Roberto Hernández hit batter A.J. Pierzynski with the bases loaded, walking in the winning run.Grady Sizemore got things started for the Indians by hitting a solo home run in the first, but the Sox would tie it up in the second on a Paul Konerko RBI groundout. Another Indian homer came from the bat of Jason Michaels, but the Sox again tie it up in the fourth with Tadahito Iguchi hitting an RBI sacrifice fly. Chicago took their first lead of the game in the seventh with a Scott Podsednik RBI, but Jason Michaels would tie it up again in the eighth. In the bottom of the ninth inning, an inside pitch hit batter A.J. Pierzynski, walking in the winning run and ending the game.Chicago starter Mark Buehrle left the game in the second inning suffering from bruising on his forearm after being hit just below the elbow of his pitching arm. He has been diagnosed with having a contusion on his left forearm, and his status will be day-to-day. Matt Thornton is credited a blown save for giving up Chicago's one run lead in the eighth. Cleveland starter Jeremy Sowers  pitched the first six innings, giving up just a hit and two runs.The White Sox, now 1-2, are staying in town to play the visiting Minnesota Twins while Cleveland, now 2-1, will go home to face off against the Seattle Mariners.In a chilly Saturday afternoon game at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, the air temperature hovering around freezing the entire game, the Minnesota bats were ice cold. White Sox pitching staff held the Minnesota Twins to only three hits. White Sox starter Javier Vázquez pitched more than six innings and gave up only a single hit in the second. Twins starter Carlos Silva gave up what would end up being the winning run in the first.Paul Konerko picked up an RBI in the first inning on a single to the outfield that scored Darin Erstad, putting Chicago ahead by one. Juan Uribe would extend the lead with a solo home run in the eighth before an attempted pickoff throw failed and the ball trickled to the outfield, allowing Scott Podsednik to score from second base.Friday evening's series opener between the AL-Central Division rivals was postponed due to the inclement cold weather, and has not yet been rescheduled. The White Sox, now 2-2, and Twins, now 3-1, will finish their series with an Easter Sunday matinée game. Highs tomorrow in Chicago are forecasted to be slightly warmer in the upper-30s.20-year-old pitching phenom Phil Hughes cruised through hitters in just his second start for the New York Yankees, but the end result created even more frustration for the organization and fans everywhere.Hughes retired 19 Texas Rangers without allowing a hit on Tuesday at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.  Established big league stars such as Kenny Lofton, Mark Teixeira and Michael Young could not solve the youngster's blazing fastball or sharply biting curve.  Hughes was on the verge of history.  Even as his pitch count rose, the Yankees allowed him to keep firing.  "He was fine," manager Joe Torre said of the 2004 first round draft pick.  "We were going to allow him to go 100 pitches last time, so I didn't think that would be a problem." Just when the Yankees thought they found an answer to their early struggles, the organization was treated to an agonizing sight.  After Teixeira fouled off an 0-2 pitch with one out in the sixth inning, Hughes grabbed his leg, having suffered a hamstring injury.  His no-hit bid ended there (Texas would break up the no-hitter in the eighth inning off reliever Mike Myers), though he did earn his first big league win in a 10-1 Yankee romp over Texas.  He walked off the mound under his own power, but will reportedly miss 4-6 weeks.  Hughes voiced his frustration afterwards: "It's tough.  It puts a damper on the whole thing."  He added, "I'm at a point now where our rotation really needs it," referring to his presence on the New York pitching staff.  Several Yankees have already voiced their excitement for the righthander's chances in the big leagues.  For his part, Yankees star Jason Giambi compared him to Roger Clemens during Spring Training: "He looks like a young Rocket."  The Yankees are currently just 10-14, thanks in large part to injuries that have befallen pitchers Chien-Ming Wang, Mike Mussina, Carl Pavano and Jeff Karstens.  In a related story from today, the Yankees fired strength and conditioning coach Marty Miller.  Reportedly, this was out of general manager Brian Cashman's concern for the alarming number of hamstring injuries so far this season.In other round one matches, Wonthaggi defeated Leongatha, Maffra played Drouin and Morwell played Warragul.The Gippsland Football League (officially the Gippsland League, GL) is the only major league in Gippsland according to the Victorian Country Football, the governing body for Australian rules football in regional Victoria, Australia.At the league's annual general meeting in December, it changed it's name from the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League.In their last encounter, the 2009 second (major) semi final, Traralgon defeated Moe by 32 points.In the photos and video below, Moe are in the maroon shorts, Traralgon in the white shorts (except as noted). Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total).Massive waves pounded the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii Tuesday, allowing for a rare surfing competition to take place.The contest is known as the Eddie Aikau competition, named after a noted Hawaiian surfer who was lost at sea during the 1970s. It has only taken place eight times in the past 25 years.Tens of thousands of spectators from across the state gathered to watch 28 expert surfers tackle the 40-foot waves. Competitor Jamie O'Brien said, "We were all stoked out there, smiling, laughing and having a good time." He added, "This is like a natural arena out here for this and it's amazing to be a part of it."The monstrous waves were caused by two cyclones to the northwest of the islands. Conditions have to be nearly perfect for the competition to commence.The winner was 24 year-old Greg Long, a first-time entrant who took home a $55,000 prize.The dangerous conditions inflicted one injury, but safety teams were on standby to deal with any accidents.Dr. Christiane Ayotte is Doping Control director at Canada's Institut National de la Recherché Scientifique, which is a World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) certified lab. Dr. Ayotte said on Tuesday (Aug. 23) that three ethically critical, and important, scientific questions were raised by a four-page doping allegation in the French cycling daily L'Équipe. L'Équipe released lab data with a medical identification allegedly finding banned EPO in five year old samples of cyclist Lance Armstrong's urine, originally taken after he won the 1999 Tour de France.  	Ayotte expressed surprise that chemical testing of 1999 urine could have been done in 2004 at the French national anti-doping laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry. She said that she routinely instructs all doping laboratory organizations that EPO deteriorates and disappears after two or three months, even if the urine is frozen. Ayotte does not question whether the new type of analysis is correct; rather she questions the ethics of long-delayed test results. The first ethical problem , in her opinion, is that an adverse finding cannot be confirmed with second samples, as required by WADA regulations. She states that there are normally two samples, "A" and "B". The Châtenay-Malabry EPO findings were based on Armstrong's "B" samples. Armstrong's "A" samples were depleted in 1999 for tests that did not include EPO, because no EPO test was available that year. French Sports Minister Jean-François Lamour said that without the "A" samples, no disciplinary action could be taken against Armstrong. The second ethical problem, in Ayotte's view, is that an athlete charged with doping long after the athletic event has no way to submit to additional testing to disprove an adverse finding. The third ethical problem for Ayotte is that L'Équipe disclosed Armstrong's medical identity. "It seems to me," Ayotte continued, "that this whole thing is breach of the WADA code. We are supposed to work confidentially until such time that we can confirm a result. By no means does this mean that we sweep a result under the carpet, but it has to meet a certain set of requirements." Ayotte continued, "I'm worried, because I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in Paris. I am concerned that they did not cover their backs before being dragged into a very public issue of this kind."Lance Armstrong has responded on his website, branding L'Équipe's reporting as being "nothing short of tabloid journalism." Armstrong says: "I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance[-]enhancing drugs."Further confusing public understanding of the EPO doping claim is  Armstrong's statement in his autobiography, It's Not About the Bike: he said he received EPO during his cancer chemotherapy treatment. "It was the only thing that kept me alive," he wrote.Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, said that Armstrong owes cycling fans an explanation. Leblanc said; "For the first time—and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts—someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body."The following is how the medal table for New Zealand looked after the third day of competition for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, in Melbourne, Australia.New Zealand won six medals yesterday.Half of them were in the Women’s and Men’s triathlons.In the Women's Individual Triathlon Sam Warriner won silver; followed closely by Andrea Hewitt who won bronze.Bevan Docherty won silver in the Men's Individual TriathlonA bronze in the Women's 50m Rifle Prone Pair is the 500th Commonwealth Games medal for New Zealand in the 76 year history of the games.Traralgon defeated Morwell last Monday in round three of the 2010 Gippsland Football League (officially Gippsland League, GL) season.

Mundine, an ex-rugby league star promoted the much-anticipated fight that attracted around 40,000 spectators and a national record for a pay-per-view television event. "Who's the man, who's the man?" Mundine asked the crowd after the fight. Western Australia's Danny Green (the "Machine") was defeated after 12 rounds at the Sydney Football Stadium by "the Man" Mundine. Mundine has improved his overall record to 26 wins and three losses. His victory sets up a world title bout against Denmark's Mikkel Kessler. After the bout Mundine praised his opponent's tenacity: "I just wanna' thank Danny for a great fight... I was starting to get loose man, Danny was starting to put a lot of pressure on me, he's got a good long jab, I had to evade that," said Mundine. "I utilized my speed to catch him and it paid dividends. I was looking for the knockout, I caught him with a few great shots, [and] he can take a great punch. He put up a good performance. He come around, he come prepared - I was the better man tonight Dan, thank you very much. We can do it again maybe, soon." Green agreed that Mundine fought the better fight. "He just beat me fair and square. I have no excuses at all, I trained unbelievable, my preparation was great... Anthony was the better man tonight," said Green.The WBA fight consolidated six years of taunts and hyperbole to settle a long-running feud between the men and their supporters. According to media reports the battle was personal from the outset with Mundine's mother Lyn yelling at her son from ringside to "Knock him out Choc, shut him up my baby". Sports media commentators reported that the pace remained hectic in the first four rounds as Mundine stood firm and used his jab as Green mixed his trademark "power punches." As the fight wore on, Mundine appeared in greater control and in better condition. However, Mundine did end up on the canvas in the seventh round, after being pushed through the ropes by Green. Throughout the fight, Green's power punches "missed, missed and missed again". In the final "ferocious" round, Mundine rocked Green with a combination to the head, taunting Green to "Come on." Green attempted plenty of combinations, but Mundine's speed caused problems. After 12 rounds, Judge Pinit Prayadsab from Thailand gave the fight to Mundine 118-11, South Korean Michael Lee scored it 116-113 and Australian Derek Milham had it 118-112.Australian newspapers report that the appreciative crowd included corporate CEOs, former world heavyweight champion Joe Frazier, bikie gangs, peroxide blondes and rugby league players. Referee Terry O'Connor described the event as a fight Australia can be proud of. "They both gave their all, it was a great fight." He described the atmosphere at Aussie Stadium as "fantastic" "It was the greatest fight I have refereed, it was brilliant," O'Connor said. The "Man v Machine" event fight, promoted by Mundine's Boxa International and the "Green Machine" promoters is believed to have beeen the "biggest boxing match in Australian history", grossing an estimated $20 million. Each boxer is reported to be earning a seven-figure sum, while spectators have paid up to A$1000 for a seat at the bout. Foxtel reported record sales for their exclusive pay-per-view event, claiming that subscriptions outsold the Lennox Lewis v Mike Tyson heavyweight bout. Heavy betting ensued with one punter laying a $500,000 bet on Mundine to take the honours.Of his upcoming bout with Denmark's Mikkel Kessler, Mundine said: "It was a close fight last time. I think he's the best fighter out there, but I've shown I can match it with him. I'm ready."Munster won the 2005-06 Heineken Cup, beating Biarritz 23 to 19 at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales.

Her travels culminated in a visit on Monday to Spring Brook Elementary School, where as a fourth-grader she set the goal of some day being an Olympian. Schaus's dream was fulfilled this year during the Vancouver Winter Olympics, when she played for the US women's ice hockey team and won a silver medal. As she addressed and answered questions from students and teachers at the grade school, Schaus explained the large amount of work she had to invest to achieve her goals. The Chicago Daily Herald reports that "she has been practicing for three to four hours a day nearly every day for the past year." She told the students to "make a dream and follow it because you never know what can happen and just have fun with it."The nostalgic visit to her elementary school followed a weekend of other appearances in Naperville, including a celebration last Saturday at Rosebud's Italian Specialties and Pizzeria.

However, he waved off suggestions from the press that Busch would leave early during the season."His goal is to finish this year with that car in first place," Hendrick said, noting that Busch is currently in the top ten in points.Earnhardt's move to Hendrick puts the son of Dale Earnhardt, Sr. at the same team as his 1990s championship rival, Jeff Gordon.

When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us."Next, third place finisher, Harvick commented, "We went down swinging and that is what we came here to do. Those guys outran us on that last restart there. All in all I’m proud of all my guys. We did everything we wanted to do today but win the race.

We did what we had to do today we just didn’t have it at the end. It’s frustrating. We had a car that could win and that is something we’ve never had here.

Following the race, Edwards was the Drivers' Championship leader with 42 points. Next, Gilliland and Labonte was tied for second, only one point behind Edwards. Kurt Busch was placed fourth with 40 points, ahead of Montoya and Smith in fifth and sixth. Kyle Busch, Menard, Martin, and A. J. Allmendinger rounded out the top-ten point positions.The 2011 season will continue on February 27, 2011 at Phoenix International Raceway for the 2011 Subway Fresh Fit 500.

Carpanedo's team finished tenth in a field of ten teams, which saw the Austria finish first, team 1 for the United States finish second, and Russia finish third.Carpanedo started the day with 232.13 International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing points, and finished her team race with a time of 26.46 seconds.  Because teammate Úrsula Pueyo had a faster time of 20.32, Carpanedo's time was not used in tabulating Spain's overall ranking as only one time by a female skier was required.Beyond Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.  Her first was the Slalom, where she earned a Did Not Finish in her first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.  Her other race, the  Giant Slalom, saw her finish in tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes  slower than first place finisher Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.  Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the race.Carpanedo is one of the founding member of the first women's disability ski team in Spain.  Created with the support of Teresa Silva,  Fundación También insisted the team be for women to encourage their participation in disability sport.  Fundación También supports a number of other sports including bicycling, sailing, table tennis, canoeing and scuba diving.  Carpanedo's Fundación También teammate Irene Villa attended the final award ceremonies in support of her teammate and winter Paralympic sport in Spain.National Football League (NFL) commissioner Roger Goodell received a  letter from sixteen female United States Senators on Thursday calling for the NFL to adopt a zero tolerance policy on domestic violence.  The senators criticized the NFL for their new domestic violence policy enacted in August. The new policy says a player will receive a six game suspension for their first offense. A video of Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice assaulting the woman who has since married him was recently released by website TMZ.  The assault took place in a elevator at an Atlantic City, New Jersey casino.  Rice was initially given a two game suspension; later, following the video release, the Ravens terminated Rice's contract and the NFL indefinitely suspended him. The bipartisan group of senators said, "If you violently assault a woman, you shouldn't get a second chance to play in the NFL." The league stated they had initiated an independent investigation by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller into the Rice incident.The cross-party signatories were, from the Democratic Party,  Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, of California,   Debbie Stabenow, Michigan;   Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota;   Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, Washington;   Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire;   Kirsten Gillibrand, New York;   Barbara Mikulski, Maryland;   Mazie Hirono, Hawaii;   Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota;   Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts;   Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin;   Kay Hagan, North Carolina;   and, from the Republican Party, Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, and Susan Collins of Maine.Quarterback Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers   broke Dan Marino's record for career touchdown passes on Sunday, throwing number 421 to receiver Greg Jennings with 4:56 left in the first quarter. The recordbreaking pass was a 16-yard slant route, and Favre had to throw a bullet to complete it. Though the game was being played at the Metrodome, even the Minnesota Vikings fans stood and applauded as Favre celebrated with his teammates.After the announcement of the record was made, a taped message from Marino played on the Jumbotron. "Hey Brett, it's Dan Marino. I'd like to take a minute to congratulate you on breaking one of the great records in sports. I loved holding the touchdown record for the past 13 years, but if someone was going to break it, I'm glad it was someone like you, who has always competed at the highest level and always played only to win," said Marino. "Over the past 17 years, you've been a credit to the Packers, and to the National Football League and to the sport that we all love so much. Brett, congratulations on touchdown 421!"This historic event came just two weeks after Favre broke John Elway's record for career wins by a quarterback, defeating the New York Giants for win number 149.  The Green Bay icon also holds the records for career completions and consecutive games started by a quarterback, which continued on Sunday at 241. Later in the second quarter of today's game, Favre threw the 8,359th pass of his career, eclipsing another of Marino's records. When asked about the record after the game, a subdued Favre said,"It's just a number. Am I proud? Absolutely. I'm more proud of the fact that we won this game...I'm pleased it's over, and I'm honored.  To play this long, I think, is a special thing and to achieve this is, uh, very special,".  He added that, in his mind, Dan Marino is still the best quarterback of all time.There were 6 games played in the National Hockey League on February 13, 2008.There were 8 games played in the National Hockey League on February 14, 2008, including the #2 Dallas Stars taking on the Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks fighting for playoff contention in the Northwest division.There were 5 games played in the National Hockey League on February 15, 2008.There were 10 games played in the National Hockey League on February 16, 2008, including the New York Rangers, who hadn't played since the afternoon of February 10, taking on the Buffalo Sabres.There were 8 games played in the National Hockey League on February 17, 2008, including the top two teams in the West, the Detroit Red Wings and the Dallas Stars, going head to head.There were 4 games played in the National Hockey League on February 18, 2008, including the struggling Detroit Red Wings, who have dropped 6 straight, taking on their rivals the Colorado Avalanche.There were 9 games played in the National Hockey League on February 20, 2008.There were 6 games played in the National Hockey League on February 20, 2008.There were 9 games played in the National Hockey League on February 21, 2008.There were 4 games played in the National Hockey League on February 22, 2008, all 8 teams being in a Western Conference race.There were 11 games played in the National Hockey League on February 23, 2008.There were 7 games played in the National Hockey League on February 24, 2008.There were 2 games played in the National Hockey League on February 25, 2008.There were 8 games played in the National Hockey League on February 26, 2008, but most of the news of the day comes from many trades happening before the trade deadline.There were 6 games played in the National Hockey League on February 27, 2008.

The suspension, for a minimum of 25 games, is a ruling for a hit Simon laid on Ryan Hollweg of the New York Rangers during a March 8 game at Nassau Veterans' Memorial Coliseum.In a press release earlier today, the NHL indicated that they considered Simon's hit on Hollweg, with a stick to the face, to be a deliberate intent to injure. "The National Hockey League will not accept the use of a stick in the manner and fashion in which Mr. Simon used his Thursday night," said Colin Campbell, NHL Senior Executive Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations.The incident occurred at 13:29 of the third period. After receiving a hard check from Hollweg, Simon swung his stick and delivered a two-handed blow to Hollweg's upper body, causing a cut on Hollweg's chin. Simon was assessed a match penalty. Based on his $1-million contract, which expires at the conclusion of the 2006-07 season, Simon forfeits a minimum of $80,213.90. The money goes to the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund.The suspension could carry over into the 2007-2008 hockey season, depending on how far the Islanders advance into the playoffs. According to the NHL press release, if the Islanders do not qualify for the 2007 playoffs, or play fewer than 10 playoff games in the 2007 playoffs, Simon would serve additional games at the start of the 2007-08 regular season to satisfy the minimum term of the suspension.Garth Snow, General Manager of the Islanders, indicated his support for Simon in a brief press release. "I spoke with Colin Campbell this morning and he informed me of his decision. Chris Simon has played a major role in our success this season and we will miss his presence in our lineup. His regret is clearly evident in the statement he released last night. Our entire organization supports Chris every step of the way."In a statement March 10, prior to the verdict, Simon expressed regret for his actions. "After watching the tape the morning after Thursday's game, I was disgusted. There is absolutely no place in hockey for what I did. I want to apologize to Ryan Hollweg. I was grateful to learn that Ryan is okay and that he returned to the game. My hope is to reach out to him in the near future."Simon explains that his behavior may have been influenced by a hit he received less than a minute before his stick swinging incident. "I do not remember much about Thursday's incident. When I saw the tape on Friday morning, it explained a lot to me when I saw the look on my face after being hit into the boards. I was completely out of it."Simon didn't appear to let it excuse his hit on Hollweg. "I need to make clear that this is not justification for the danger I put Ryan Hollweg in and the damage I have caused the game. I understand disciplinary action will be taken."The Associated Press indicated that criminal charges against Simon are being considered. According to a spokesperson for Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice, "no decision has been reached" on bringing charges, but that "prosecutors would review the tape."The National Hockey League has announced in a press conference earlier this week that it will open the 2008-09 NHL season with two series' in Europe. On October 4 and October 5, the New York Rangers and Tampa Bay Lightning will play in Prague, Czech Republic at the Sazka Arena, and the Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins will play in Stockholm, Sweden at the Stockholm Globe Arena.Each of the four teams will also play exhibition  games in Europe. The Rangers will play against Metallurg Magnitogorsk of Russia's elite league in the IIHF-sanctioned Victoria Cup. The Senators will play against Frolunda of Sweden's elite league. The Lightning and Penguins will play exhibition games in Germany and Finland respectively.This will be the second season in a row that the NHL season kicks off with regular season games being played in Europe; at the start of the current 2007-08 season, the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks played games at London's O2 September 28 and September 29.Following a three-day summit in Sydney rugby union officials reached a decision to start a National Rugby Competition in Australia in July 2007. The aim of the competition will be to bridge the gap between Super 14 and club rugby. The competition will most likely be similar to similar to New Zealand's National Provincial Championship and South Africa's Currie Cup.It was revealed that the eight-team competition will involve three teams from New South Wales, two from Queensland and one each from the ACT, Western Australia and Victoria. The QRU later revealed that one of the Queensland sides will most likely be playing out of Queensland Rugby's old home Ballymore Stadium, with the other team going to either the Gold Coast or Northern Queensland.Some Sydney clubs, in particular, Randwick and Sydney University Football Club were opposed to the competition, and want stand-alone status in the competition rather than being part of a cumulative Sydney team, also believing that the competition will see them lose funding. Businessman John Singleton came out and showed his interest in having one of the NSW sides playing at Central Coast Stadium.Super 14 players will be playing, but as there will be twice as many clubs as the Super 14, so there will be a lot of available spaces for club footballers. There is no plan for an immediate draft. Although Super 14 players will be playing, around 30 players will be unavailable due to Wallaby duties. The ABC has apparently expressed interest in broadcasting the games next year.Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) is to celebrate "Women in League" week, starting yesterday, with themes including sons, raising funds for breast cancer support, and club-related specials to encourage women to attend rugby league games.  The week-long celebration of women was started in 2006 to highlight the importance of women to the sport and make the game female-friendlier.The NRL is planning to celebrate the week in a number of ways, including having teams compete in pink uniforms, and having fans vote for the NRL player fans believe "acts as a role model for mothers and families; someone who continues to impress us on the field, however their off-field characteristics embody what it is we love about rugby league". Additionally, funds are to be raised for the McGrath Foundation, a charity dedicated to breast cancer support and education, and the Women in League Achievement Award will be given out with the winner earning a AU$5,000 gift card to Harvey Norman, an Australian electronics store.The NRL has been promoting the event on their Women in League Facebook page. In the past month, their Facebook updates have included posts featuring male players discussing support they received from women in their lives, sales of pink coloured NRL merchandise, plugs encouraging people to vote for their favourite son, pictures of men supporting Women in League, NRL club promotions for tickets and other events connected to Women in League, and information on a school visit promoting anti-bullying. The Facebook page has also promoted women's participation and profiles of women's players as recently as a month ago, when on April 9, it promoted the  Girls 'Come and Try' Day in Canberra.  Prior to that, women were last promoted as players on February 10 when pictures were shared of the Women's All Stars team match with the Indigenous All Stars team.140,000 women in Australia are involved with rugby league as players, sport administrators, coaches, employees, club members, or volunteers. Karen Hardy of The Canberra Times estimates this number could easily be quadrupled if wives, girlfriends, mothers, and other female family members who support male players were included.  Participation is also increasing, with almost a thousand new female players taking up the sport between 2011 and 2012 for 5,801 total registered female players in 2012.The National Basketball Association (NBA) has released the rosters for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game.

ESPN first reported the decision early yesterday.  The players confirmed the deal in the afternoon with a joint appearance on the network.  The Miami Heat did not comment per NBA rules which prevented teams from discussing contracts prior to Thursday at 12:01 a.m. (ET), at which point contracts may be signed.  Bosh, a power forward, comes to the Heat after playing the first seven years of his career with the Toronto Raptors.  It is still unclear whether Bosh will sign a contract outright with the Heat, or if he will sign with the Raptors then be traded to the Heat.  Raptors and Heat officials are attempting to negotiate a sign-and-trade deal which will allow the Raptors to receive players or draft picks for losing Bosh, and will allow Bosh to receive as much as $25 million more in a contract.Wade, a point guard, returns to the Heat, the team where he has played his entire NBA career.  Wade was considering a move to the Chicago Bulls, but in the end decided to stay in Miami.  He told ESPN, "It became the best decision for me, especially when Chris said he wanted to come down."Both men feel that this situation will give them the best opportunity to win NBA titles.  Said Bosh, "It's not about the money. It's not about anything else except for winning. I'm a winner. Dwyane's a winner. We're going to bring winning to Miami."As part of the NBA all-star weekend, the National Basketball Development League held its second annual all-star game featuring the stars of the league who hope to receive a break on an NBA team.The game was held in New Orleans, Louisiana and broadcast on NBA TV. The all-stars made up two teams, a blue team captioned by the winningest coach in NBA history Lenny Wilkins and a red team captioned by former Golden State Warriors great and member of the 50 greatest players of all-time, Rick Barry. The blue team won the game by a score of 117-99 over the red team.After the red team won the first quarter the blue team dominated the rest of the game, led by 22 points from the game’s Most Valuable Player Jeremy Richardson of the Fort Wayne Mad Ants and formerly of the San Antonio Spurs. The red team was led by 20 points and 10 rebounds from Elton Brown of the Colorado 14ers. The NBDL is made up of players assigned to teams based on affiliations from the NBA for further development needed to compete. Fifteen percent of all players now in the NBA came from the NBDL.Gilbert Arenas, a star player in the American National Basketball Association's Washington Wizards, now faces up to six months in prison after pleading guilty to felony gun possession charges today in a Washington, D.C. court. This plea was part of a plea bargain that he agreed to which would shorten his jail term if he cooperated with authorities. Arenas, 28, was charged with the crime after he allegedly pulled an unloaded gun on a teammate in the team's locker room on December 21, which he says was a joke on the teammate. Arenas was later found to have been keeping firearms in his locker after an investigation by police and the NBA.Meanwhile, Arenas has been suspended for an indefinite time by NBA commissioner David Stern without pay. This action has also gained support among the Washington Wizards and its players, according to the team.According to Arenas, he stored four guns in the locker room, all of them being unloaded. When asked for his reasoning, he cited that he had young children and did not want the guns in his home around them. He also said that he did not know that keeping the guns in the locker room was a violation of Washington D.C.'s gun laws, which have grown very strict recently.On December 19, two days before the incident, Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton got into a heated argument about gambling debts on the team's private jet. Crittenton, on whom Arenas pulled the gun, is not known whether to be carrying a gun at the time of the incident, or if he pulled the gun on Arenas. A police raid of his home yielded no results, and Crittenton has not been charged in the matter.Antawn Jamison, another star Wizard player and friend of Arenas, has not spoken with Arenas since he was charged. "Hopefully he's doing better than what I'd be doing in the situation or better than I expect. But one thing about Gilbert, he's a tough-minded individual," Jamison commented on the situation."I'm a goof ball and that's what I am," says Arenas about the situation, "So, even doing something like this, I'm going to make fun of it and that's how I am," he added.Arenas, 28, has been selected to three NBA-All-Star teams. He recently scored his 10,000th career point in November. Arenas also holds the NBA record for most points scored in a single overtime period, with 16.NBA Commissioner David Stern suspended Washington Wizards teammates Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton for the remainder of the 2010 NBA season on Wednesday, January 27. The suspensions came after a fallout stemming from the two bringing guns into the Wizards' locker room.The suspensions took place after a one-hour meeting between Arenas and Stern. Stern noted that his decision on the two was to be harsh, as "guns are prohibited from being in our buildings and in team business...it's very potentially dangerous to our players and to anyone else who might be involved." Arenas had earlier pleaded guilty to felony gun possession, and Crittenton pleaded guilty earlier this month to a misdemeanor gun charge.Crittenton had not played for the Wizards this season, and will not likely be back in a Wizards uniform as his contract expires at the end of the season. Arenas' suspension amounted to 48 games, making his the third longest non-drug related suspension in NBA history, behind Latrell Sprewell and Ron Artest, who missed 68 and 73 games, respectively.The Wizards backed Stern's decision, releasing a statement that the two "violated the trust of our fans and stands in contrast to everything that [owner] Abe Pollin stood for throughout his life." The team was originally named the Washington Bullets until 1997, when Pollin changed the team name to Wizards to express his abhorrence of gun violence in the Washington, D.C. community.On Friday, the Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association agreed to send forward-center Pau Gasol and their 2010 second-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for center Kwame Brown, rookie point guard Javaris Crittenton, and two first-round draft picks in 2008 and 2010.Also sent to Memphis were Pau's brother Marc Gasol, and Aaron McKie, who was signed by the Lakers the same day.Lakers General Manger Mitch Kupchak said, "Pau is a proven player of All-Star caliber in this league who can score and rebound and he's still a young player. We feel this move strengthens our team in the short term as well as the long term."The Commercial Appeal, a Memphis newspaper, also reports that Grizzlies forward Stromile Swift will be traded to the New Jersey Nets for center Jason Collins in a deal expected to be finalized on Monday.Gasol is averaging 18.9 points and 8.8 rebounds per game this season, while Brown has a season average 5.7 points and 5.7 rebounds per game.The move officially ended the former number one over all pick's dubious stay in Los Angeles.  In his two plus years with the Lakers, Brown never was able to play consistent enough to please the front office.  The ability of Los Angeles to acquire Gasol for Brown, Crittenton and two future first round draft picks has some around the league scratching their heads.  "How can the Lakers get Pau Freakin' Gasol and not give up one of their nine best players," fumed NY Post column contributor William Mcknight.Unbalanced trade or not, the Lakers now will head into the second half of the season as one of the strongest teams in the elite team heavy Western Conference.NBA small forward LeBron James announced today that he will "take his talents to South Beach and join the Miami Heat," after spending six years as the star player for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Anticipation over LeBron's future team had been simmering for weeks as NBA teams tried to lure the free agent to their rosters. LeBron had met with representatives from the Cavaliers, Heat, Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Los Angeles Clippers.In an interview televised by ESPN, James said that the Heat would give him "the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future also." However, James admitted, "I can't say it was always in my plans, because I never thought it was possible," and that he had changed his mind repeatedly in the days leading up to the announcement. He emphasized, "It's not about individuals. It's about a team." James also said in the interview that "the things that the Miami Heat franchise have done, to free up cap space and be able to put themselves in a position this summer to have all three of us, it was hard to turn down. Those are two great players (Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh), two of the greatest players that we have in this game today."Referring to his fans in Ohio, James said, "They can have mixed emotions, of course," and that his hometown of Akron in the state will "always be home for me."Though Cleveland had offered James more money, to James and new teammates Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, winning seemed to be more important. Both Wade and Bosh settled for less cash, instead fitting James into Miami's salary cap space.Wade had announced Wednesday that he would be continuing to play in Miami, while Bosh decided to move to Florida from the Toronto Raptors. The three were drafted in 2003 and were teammates in the 2008 US Olympic basketball team. Wade said that playing with James and Bosh was "going to be crazy," while Bosh tweeted, "Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Fans in Miami honked horns outside the Heat's home arena, while television images from Cleveland showed LeBron James's jerseys being burned. Prior to the announcement, amid rumors that James would sign with the Heat, Heat season tickets had sold out.Citing "league sources," both CNN/SI and the Boston Globe are reporting that Kevin Garnett is going to the Boston Celtics in a trade involving at least six players. This transaction in the United States' premier professional basketball league NBA, which is contingent on a contract negotiation, would be considered major.The forward, known as "Big Ticket", who has spent his entire twelve season career playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves, will join fellow all-stars Paul Pierce and Ray Allen to give Boston a boost in the Eastern Conference.Although the deal is yet to be announced formally by either team, many news agencies are reporting that the deal has been finalized. Kevin Garnett will go to Boston, in exchange for Celtic players Al Jefferson, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, and Theo Ratliff, along with two future NBA draft picks.In the NCAA Ice Hockey east regional finals played last night at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York the Rochester Institute of Technology Tigers beat the UNH Wildcats 6-2.

Twenty-five conferences held their championship games this past week, cementing the postseason destinies of schools headed to the national tournament.The Florida Gators became the NCAA Men's Basketball champions for the second straight year Monday night, defeating the Ohio State Buckeyes 84-75 for the title. Despite Greg Oden's 25 points and 12 rebounds, Ohio State couldn't top Joakim Noah and the Gators. Said Florida guard Corey Brewer of the victory, ""This is what we're all about at the University of Florida, winning championships." The Gators became the first back-to-back champions since the Duke Blue Devils won back-to-back in 1991 and 1992.Winning the Men's Basketball championship gives the University of Florida wins in both of the NCAA's top sporting events, basketball and football. The Gators defeated Ohio State 41-14 in the football championship in January.Ohio State's troubles many, going just 4 for 23 from three point range in the game, and 30 for 64 on field goals. Mike Conley, Jr. added 20 points to Oden's 25, but Florida's four players scoring in double-digits were too much for the Buckeyes to overcome. The Gators went 26 of 53 from field goal range and 10 of 18 on three point attempts.The field for both the 65-team NCAA national tournament and the 32-team National Invitation Tournament were set yesterday following the conclusion of the final conference tournaments.The 65-team NCAA Tournament is highlighted by top seeds Florida (Midwest regional), North Carolina (East regional), Ohio State (South regional), and Kansas (West regional). An opening round game between Niagara and Florida A&M will take place on Tuesday night, with the first round of the tournament being played out on Thursday and Friday.A number of teams widely considered to be "on the bubble" were not selected and instead will join the 32-team NIT field, which begins play on Tuesday night, March 13. The top seeds for the NIT are Mississippi State, West Virginia, Air Force, and Clemson. Of the top seeds, West Virginia and Air Force had a chance at being selected for the NCAA tournament. However, when they were not selected, they were relegated to the NIT.The championship for the NIT will take place on March 29, with the championship of the NCAA tournament and the right to be called the "National Champion" taking place on April 2.Clif Brown led the charge for Niagara, scoring 32 points and shooting 6-11 from behind the arc in helping the Purple Eagles defeat the Florida A&M Rattlers 77-69 on Tuesday night.Brown, despite playing the last four minutes in danger of fouling out, shot 10-18 from the field and picked up six rebounds to lead Niagara. Charron Fisher, leading scorer for the Eagles, contributed 13 points and 8 rebounds despite being in foul trouble for much of the second half.The Rattlers, despite outshooting the Eagles percentage-wise 46 to 40, could not catch up to the Eagles, thanks in part to a team that went 7-18 from the free throw line. Niagara, by contrast, went 21-28 from the free throw line, and also hit four more 3-pointers than the Rattlers.It was the first opening-round experience for Niagara, who advance to play the Kansas Jayhawks on Friday in Chicago. Florida A&M had been to Dayton for the "play-in" game once before, when they defeated Lehigh in 2004.The first round of the NCAA tournament begins on Thursday at eight regional sites, and continues on Friday at eight different sites. The second round of the tournament will be played out over the weekend, with the regional semifinals and finals next Thursday through Sunday.The first three games of the NCAA tournament yielded two close games and one blowout. All three games featured victories by the higher seeds.National Semi-Final Round of the 2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball TournamentThe men's basketball program of the University of Connecticut (UConn) has been cited by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for eight major violations of its recruiting policy. These allegations have resulted in the resignation of two of the team's assistant coaches, Beau Archibald and Patrick Sellers. Head coach Jim Calhoun is also accused by the NCAA of not monitoring the activities of his assistant coaches closely enough, which they said lead to the rules violations.These citations come after the NCAA's 15-monthlong investigation relating to the team's possible recruiting violations of Nate Miles, who was set to play for the team during the 2007–08 season until he was expelled from the school for a restraining order violation. Sellers and Archibald are accused of placing 160 unauthorized phone calls and sending 191 unauthorized text messages to recruits who had not yet committed to play for the team yet, which is a violation of NCAA rules because teams are only allowed to place a certain amount of phone calls to recruits."Coaching is my passion and something I have spent many years of enjoyment doing I want the record to reflect this and for the people to see the respect and integrity that I will show toward the process in the months ahead," said Sellers in a statement, promising to cooperate with any further NCAA investigation.Former coach Archibald also allegedly placed an unauthorized phone call that lasted approximately 29 minutes. However, the player's name was kept anonymous and withheld from the report. The investigation also reports that the two accused assistant coaches gave improper and false information when NCAA investigators interviewed the two about the situation. Both Sellers and Archibald have resigned within the past 2 weeks. It's not exactly, certainly anywhere near the high point of my career, as a matter of fact it's certainly one of the lowest points at any time that you are accused of doing something. It's a very serious matter," said Calhoun, who has been the coach for UConn for the past 28 years. Calhoun, 68, has already been enshrined in the College Basketball Hall of Fame and recently signed a $13 million contract extension with UConn. In the NCAA report, Calhoun, among other things, was criticised for not watching over "...the conduct and administration of the men's basketball staff in the areas of: telephone records, representatives of the institution's athletics interests; and, complimentary admissions or discretionary tickets,"UConn has been scheduled to appear in front of NCAA investigators on October 18 for sanctioning and further investigation. It is likely that the basketball program could lose scholarships and receive probation.Former Grambling State head coach Eddie Robinson died Tuesday night, after a lengthy fight with Alzheimer's disease. Robinson was diagnosed with the disease in 1997, and spent the last year in a nursing home.Robinson passed, not long after being admitted to Lincoln General Hospital in Ruston, La., as reported by former Grambling State quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, Doug Williams. Williams added, "He'd been fighting that battle for a long time, It was one of the many he fought in his lifetime. We all know it's coming. But that's Eddie Robinson. Eddie Robinson is not supposed to go. But when you look back at it, there's lot of joy in it too. I don't think none of us have to worry about where he's going to be from now on. He is a gate keeper."The following is a statement from Ms. Doris Robinson, wife of Eddie Robinson: "The many expressions of support, sympathy, and gratitude that we have received from all over the country have been overwhelming. I truly appreciate each and every person, so many of whom we have never met, who has said such kind and inspiring words about Eddie, his legacy, and our family. Our love and admiration for Eddie were unyielding, as was Eddie’s for his immediate family and his extended Grambling family. Eddie was the consummate husband, father, teacher, leader, role model, and, most of all, the greatest of Americans. Words cannot express the loneliness that I will feel without my beloved Eddie. However, I realize, and the immediate family realizes, the greatness that Eddie contributed to our society. He will forever fill our hearts, minds, and souls."Robinson's career highlights included 57 years as head coach at Grambling State University, 408 victories, 45 winning seasons, 17 Southwestern Conference Championships, and over 200 players sent into the NFL. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, April 11, beginning at 11:00 a.m. in the Assembly Center on the campus of Grambling State University (across from Robinson Stadium). Internment will be at Memorial Gardens in Grambling, La.Three players for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football team have been arrested following a rape allegation. The three players have been identified as defensive end Alex Daniels, cornerback Keith Massey, and running back E.J. Jones, all sophomores. They are in custody at the Hennepin County Jail pending charges. Bail has been set at $100,000 for each player.The three are accused of raping an 18-year old woman at the University Village Apartments, where the accused players live. "Overnight one of the University Officers was flagged down by a young woman who wanted to make a report that she'd been sexually assaulted," said University Police Chief Greg Hestness. Hestness did not disclose further details of the allegations, though he stated the players "were booked on criminal sexual conduct in the third degree. And that usually does involve penetration, non-consensual penetration." Once an investigation is complete, the case will be presented to the Hennepin County attorney for possible charges.Following Saturday's spring scrimmage at the Metrodome, new coach Tim Brewster said "Obviously it's a disappointing situation that's been presented to me. There's an investigation that's ongoing that we're going to cooperate fully with." The players have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation, and did not participate in the annual intrasquad game.Gophers athletic director Joel Maturi said "We will let the process take its course and then do the appropriate thing. But I'm not ready to abandon these kids. It's our responsibility to stand by them and their families."The University of Southern California's football team was heavily penalized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) yesterday due to several major rules violations involving former player and Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush. The team was banned from participating in all NCAA bowl games for the 2010 and 2011 seasons, as well as was vacated of all wins during the 2004 and 2005 seasons. The team will likely also be stripped of their national title from the 2004 season and will lose ten football scholarships per year for the 2010, 2011, and 2012 seasons.The NCAA also criticized the university for ineffective monitoring of its student-athletes. "The general campus environment surrounding the violations troubled the committee. At least at the time of the football violations, there was relatively little effective monitoring of, among others, football locker rooms and sidelines, and there existed a general post-game locker room environment that made compliance efforts difficult," said part of the NCAA's report.The rules violations, which were investigated by the NCAA over a four-year period, involved the team's alleged "improper benefits," given to Bush, as well as Bush's contact with an agent, which is illegal under NCAA rules until a player has left the sports program. It is also possible that this will result in the loss of Bush's Heisman Trophy. The NCAA report ordered USC to not be in contact with Bush for the current time."We acknowledge that violations occurred and we take full responsibility for them. However, we sharply disagree with many of the findings in the NCAA Committee on Infractions Report. Further, we feel the penalties imposed are too severe for the violations identified in the report," stated Todd Dickey, the senior vice president of administration at USC.Meanwhile, Reggie Bush (who now plays for the NFL's New Orleans Saints) also released a statement. "I am disappointed by the decision and disagree with the NCAA's findings. If the University decides to appeal, I will continue to cooperate with the NCAA and USC, as I did during the investigation. In the meantime, I will continue to focus on making a positive impact for the University and for the community where I live," said Bush. Bush denies all of the allegations brought against him and the university by the NCAA.The report also included punishments for the men's basketball team, which was accused of violating the NCAA's recruiting policy on former player O.J. Mayo. The women's tennis team was also fined for allowing an unidentified student to use a university-owned credit card to place $7,000 in unauthorized phone calls.The NCAA men's Division I basketball tournament has entered the quarterfinal, or "Elite Eight", round of play, in what is shaping up to be an exciting tournament with its fair share of upsets and underdogs.One example of outstanding play by a low-seeded team is #7 seed West Virginia, who beat #2 seeded Wake Forest in a double overtime game in which junior guard Mike Gansey poured in 29 points, many late in the game.West Virginia plays #4 seed Louisville at 4:40 PM EST tonight, while #3 seed Arizona plays #1 seed Illinois at 7:05 PM EST.A major change for one of the United States Division I NCAA member conferences was accidentally leaked to the news media a week early. It appears the Mid-Continent Conference has secretly been planning to change its name to the "Summit League," for some time, according to a television report by Indiana's News Center in Fort Wayne.The secret was planned by the league officials to be revealed in a May 15 news conference, when the Mid-Con was also scheduled to unveil a new conference logo, the television report said. The local television station said it noticed the change when new 2007-2008 telephone directories were released for Fort Wayne by Verizon Communications. It included an advertisement stating that IPFW, the local NCAA Division I university, would be joining the "Summit League" as a member school in 2007. Previously the university said it was joining the Mid-Continent Conference as of July 1, 2007.According to the television report, when asked to clarify the matter, IPFW confirmed that the Mid-Con will be changing its name to "Summit League," that the decision had been made some time ago. According to the report, the "Summit League" moniker will take effect in June.The Netherlands defeated Uruguay in the semifinals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup on Tuesday. Uruguay was the last South American team holdout in the tournament. This year's World Cup is is being hosted by South Africa.Giovanni van Bronckhorst scored for the Dutch with a 35-yard shot in the eighteenth minute, while Uruguay's Diego Forlan scored his fourth goal in this year's World Cup to tie in the 41st minute. However, after the Netherlands' coach Bert van Marwijk replaced Demy de Zeeuw with attacker Rafael van der Vaart at halftime, the Dutch went on a roll, with Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben both scoring in the second half. They scored in quick succession, in the 70th and 73rd minutes, respectively. Uruguay later narrowed the Dutch's lead to one point in injury time, but the orange-clad Dutch beat back late Uruguayan pressure after the injury time goal was scored.The Dutch team was jubilant after their semifinal win. "This is unforgettable," Sneijder said. "It was a tough fight and toward the end we complicated matters. Sunday we play in the World Cup final. I have to get used to that."Coach Bert van Marwijk was also happy. "This is very special. After 32 years we play the final again. Such a small country. We can be very proud of this." Van Marwijk has been coach of the Netherlands for two years.Fans of the Netherlands' soccer team were wildly celebrating too. 45 minutes after the small Western European country won, many fans returned to Cape Town's Green Point Stadium to see the players do a victory dance. Many of the fans beat drums and cheered "Holland! Holland! Holland!"The Dutch will face either Spain or Germany Sunday in the World Cup finals. This will be their first World Cup final appearance since 1978, when they lost 3-1 to Argentina, who was playing on their home turf. The Dutch also lost the championship in 1974. Uruguay hadn't appeared in the semifinals since 1970. However, they won the World Cup in 1930, and again in 1950, but they have since suffered a 60-year drought, which continues to this day.Yesterday, the Netherlands football team crashed out of the UEFA Euro Cup 2016 after a 2–3 defeat against the Czech Republic in a qualifying match.

The authors not only implicate professional baseball celebrity Barry Bonds in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, but also say Gary Sheffield received human growth hormone and testosterone from Greg Anderson, Bonds's personal trainer. The book goes on to claim that Jason Giambi also took performance-enhancing drugs from Anderson. Bonds continues to insist that he did not realize his trainer was giving him steriods. He claimed in his grand jury testimony that he thought he was receiving flaxseed oil and an arthritis salve. Sheffield's response to the claims was quite simple: when asked if the allegations made against him were true, his response was "Nope."Despite the book's accusations of Sheffield and Giambi, it centers around Bonds and the founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative or BALCO, Victor Conte Jr. Conte is currently serving four months in prison for distribution of steriods and money laundering. It appears that the steroid controversy concerning Bonds will only intensify as he continues to march on towards the career home runs record, one of baseball's most sacred records.New Caledonia is beginning to prepare for the 2011 South Pacific Games, hosting duties won after a vote in Palau.On July 31, the South Pacific Games Council met to decide on the matter, with the meeting announced to the public by Michael White, NMI chef de mission to the 2005 Palau South Pacific Mini Games. The hosting duties were also bid on by the Solomon Islands, and American Samoa, which was eliminated in the first round.The last time that the city of Noumea, New Caledonia hosted the event was 1987.Any country that sends athletes to participate in the SPG is eligible to host the competition.The New Caledonia win is the culmination of a six-year bid process that all interested countries must follow. White commented, "The charter lays out the time requirements you have to submit a bid and the charter prescribes what elements have to be covered in your bid proposals. Then at some point, six years before the Games, the SPG council reviews all the bids and hears presentations from the bidding countries and decides which country is going to be awarded the Games."The Micronesian Games Council is still deciding which city will host the 2006 Micronesian Games. Officials from Yap, the original host of the event, say that they won't be ready to host the event due to damage from a recent typhoon. The Republic of the Marshall Islands will host the 2010 Micronesian Games.The New England Patriots are 18-0.  They will be heading for Glendale, Arizona, the site of Super Bowl 42.

The New England Patriots will face the San Diego Chargers at Foxborough on January 20.With a 38-35 victory over the New York Giants at Giants Stadium Saturday night, the New England Patriots became the second team in the modern era of the National Football League to go undefeated (16-0) in the regular season. The only other team to have achieved this feat was the Miami Dolphins in 1972, who were 14-0 due to a different regular season structure at the time.Trailing by as many as 12 points in the third quarter, the Patriots soon came back with touchdowns from running back Laurence Maroney and wide receiver Randy Moss.Two other NFL records were broken in the course of one play; with 11:06 remaining in the game, quarterback Tom Brady threw a pass to Moss for a touchdown. This broke Peyton Manning's record of 49 touchdown passes and Jerry Rice's record of 22 touchdown catches. The Patriots also ended up with a record-high 589 points for the season."In this game of football, it's hard to go 16-and-0," Moss stated. "As a football player and a fan of the game, my hat's off to this organization."Don Shula, coach of the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins, commended the Patriots, saying "going undefeated during the regular season is a remarkable achievement."In an attempt to reach as many viewers as possible, the game was simulcast on three networks, with the coverage from NFL Network (only digital/satellite channel) being broadcast on NBC and CBS. This was the first NFL game to be nationally televised on more than one broadcast network since Super Bowl I in 1967.NFL opening week continued with AFC East rivals New York Jets hosting the New England Patriots at Giants Stadium.  The Patriots signed wide receiver Randy Moss during the off-season, and it didn't take him long to showcase his talents.

The Patriots struck first with a touchdown pass from Brady to Wes Walker in the first quarter and the Jets evened the score in the second quarter with a pass from Chad Pennington to Laveranues Coles.  However, aft that,  New England scored 3 consecutive touchdowns for a 28-7 lead and never looked back, eventually winning 38-14.  Chad Pennington hurt his ankle in the third quarter on a hard hit by Jarvis Green, but came back after one set of downs. He is scheduled to meet with team doctors this week to evaluate the injury. The Patriots host the San Diego Chargers, a highly anticipated AFC match-up Sunday 9/16 at 8:15pm EST while the Jets visit the Ravens in Baltimore on Sunday 9/16 at 4:15pm EST.Auckland, New Zealand has been announced as the new host of the 2007 Netball World Championships, beating Christchurch. Auckland replaces Fiji as the hosts following their coup last year. The decision was announced by the International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA) and the Netball New Zealand Board (NNZ). President of the IFNA, Molly Rhone, said: "IFNA would like to thank both Auckland and Christchurch for their offers and welcome Auckland as the new host of 12th World Netball Championships in New Zealand."Garry Moore, mayor of Christchurch, said that it is disappointing for Christchurch to not have gained the hosting rights, but is still proud of the bid they made in the very short time frame they were given. "I want to congratulate Auckland and wish them all the very best in what will be a very exciting time in the City of Sails." Mr Moore has called for support for Auckland, and has said that Christchurch will still benefit financially from Auckland having the hosting rights, as well as New Zealand as a whole. He gives his luck to Auckland for a successful Championships.The Netball World Championships, which happens every four years, will be held between 10 November and 17 November later this year, later than originally planned so the hosts and venues can be better prepared. The games will be played at Trusts Stadium, Waitakere, Auckland and the semi-finals and final may be played at Vector Arena, if it has been completed.Bob Harvey, mayor of Waitakere, said that he expects millions of dollars to be put into the local economy because of the Championships. Mr Harvey said the council put NZ$50,000 into their bid to host the Championships and has set aside $70,000 for the hosting of the games. Mr Harvey said that he is delighted that the region has managed to secure the hosting rights, and expects Vector Arena to be completed in time to host the semi-finals and final.Don Mackinnon, NNZ Board Chair, said: "We’re grateful to the Venues who worked with their City Councils and Netball communities in preparing these offers, and congratulate Auckland on their successful proposal."Dick Hubbard, mayor of Auckland City, is pleased that the hosting rights were given to Auckland, the "home to 25,630 registered netball players." "Auckland City recognises the hugely important role netball plays in our community and is excited about showing our passion for the game to the world." Mr Hubbard said that the Championships will also provide a good start for Auckland in the lead up to the 2011 Rugby World Cup.Ruth Aitken, coach of New Zealand's netball team, Silver Ferns, said that it will be good for her players that the Championships are being held in Auckland. She said that playing at home is a wonderful opportunity.Mr Mackinnon has announced that a new organisation will be formed to help with the preparation of the Championships, along with the work NNZ has already done.Ms Rhone, said that it was major benefit for the Championships that NNZ was willing to make the dates and venues final so quickly, as it means that preparation can now get started for the venues and the 16 participating netball teams. "Running a world class event in a compressed timeframe will be a challenge, but with the support of the Auckland community, we know that New Zealand will be able to host an excellent World Netball Championships," Mr Mackinnon said.Mr Mackinnon said that he and NNZ are looking forward to hosting the championship, which he described as the pinnacle event of Netball.One of the reasons that Christchurch did not gain the hosting rights this year might have been because in 1999, Christchurch hosted the event.Larry Robinson resigned as coach of the New Jersey Devils on Monday afternoon because of stress-related health issues. Devils president and general manager Lou Lamoriello will take over the coach position temporarily until the new coach would be brought "as soon as possible"."Stress is a killer," Mr. Robinson said during the announcement. "I lost a dear brother last year and that changed my thoughts about life a lot. My parents are no longer around. I want to be able to enjoy my kids. I worked and I played for 20 years so I could give everything I wasn't able to have for myself to my children, and they suffered for my absence."Robinson, who coached Devils to 2000 Stanley Cup championship and 2001 Stanley Cup Finals, returned to coach the Devils last July after Pat Burns was diagnosed with cancer."A lot of things were getting to me. I want this team to be successful, but if I can't be at my best and it's bothering me healthwise, I can't do that," Robinson said.Robinson's resignation is the second NHL coaching change this season, following Eddie Olczyk's dismissal by the Pittsburgh Penguins last week.54-year-old Robinson missed 2 games this month with flu and sinus problems, he said that he already underwent tests, including an CAT test because of continuing "horrible headaches".The New York Giants defeated the New England Patriots 17-14 to win Super Bowl XLII at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Sunday night. A touchdown by the New York Giants in the last seconds of the very tight game disrupted the New England Patriots' quest for a perfect, undefeated season.The Patriots attained the lead early in the second quarter, and regained it with 2:42 left in the 4th quarter, losing it only when the game-winning touchdown was scored by Plaxico Burress with 35 seconds left to play."The drive at the end there were so many clutch plays by so many guys. It is an unbelievable game and an unbelievable feeling," said Giants quarterback Eli Manning.The first quarter started off with a 16 play drive by the Giants which took up nearly 10 minutes and ended in a field goal. Three seconds into the second quarter, the Patriots answered back with a 1 yard run from Laurence Maroney after a pass interference call.The third quarter of the game was scoreless. With 11:05 remaining in the fourth quarter, Eli Manning threw a five yard pass to David Tyree, making the score 10-7. The Patriots then made the score 14-10 on a seven yard pass from Tom Brady to Randy Moss.The next drive for the Giants proved to be the winning one, with Tyree catching a pass that led the team to the Patriots' 24 yard line; Plaxico Burress' following touchdown reception was enough to regain the lead and win the game. Eli Manning was named the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player and was awarded the Pete Rozell Trophy."This is the greatest feeling in professional sports. For us to come out and win a world championship tonight -- nobody gave us a shot," said Plaxico Burress.George Michael Steinbrenner III, businessman, owner and former principal executive of the New York Yankees, died at 6:30 a.m. EDT (1030 UTC) Tuesday of a massive heart attack at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, Florida, at age 80.His family issued a statement saying, "It is with profound sadness that the family of George M. Steinbrenner III announces his passing. He was an incredible and charitable man....He was a visionary and a giant in the world of sports. He took a great but struggling franchise and turned it into a champion again."Born on July 4, 1930, Steinbrenner, a former shipping magnate, bought the Yankees from CBS in 1973. As owner of the Yankees, he led the team to eleven American League pennants and seven World Series titles. Nicknamed "The Boss," Steinbrenner pursued free agents with great fervor, signing Reggie Jackson to a five-year, US$3.5 million deal after the 1976 season. He also frequently changed managers, including firing and rehiring Billy Martin five times. Steinbrenner was banned from baseball in 1990 for paying US$400,000 to get information to discredit former Yankees outfielder David Winfield, but was reinstated in 1993. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered flags at City Hall Plaza to be lowered to half mast, saying, "Our hearts and prayers go out to the entire Steinbrenner family. This is a sad day not only for Yankee fans, but for our entire city, as few people have had a bigger impact on New York over the past four decades than George Steinbrenner."Fred Wilpon, Jeff Wilpon, and Saul Katz, owners of the Yankees' crosstown rival Mets, said, "The passing of George Steinbrenner marks the end of an era in New York City baseball history."Yankees legend Yogi Berra said, "George was The Boss, make no mistake. He built the Yankees into champions and that's something nobody can ever deny. He was a very generous, caring, passionate man. George and I had our differences, but who didn't? We became great friends over the last decade and I will miss him very much."Current Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig said that he is "very saddened" to hear of the loss and added, "George was a giant of the game and his devotion to baseball was surpassed only by his devotion to his family and his beloved New York Yankees....We will miss him, especially Tuesday night when the baseball family will be gathered at Angel Stadium for the All-Star Game."Steinbrenner is survived by his wife Joan, two sisters, four children, including Hank and Hal, who took over Yankees operations in 2007, and his grandchildren. The Steinbrenner family said that he will have a private funeral and a public service would be held at a later date. His death comes at a time of great sadness for the Yankees, as two days earlier longtime Yankees public announcer Bob Sheppard died at 99.New Zealand Cricket is coming under increasing domestic pressure to reject a touring trip to Zimbabwe. The International Cricket Council (ICC), however, has demanded of the New Zealand Cricket team, called the 'Black Caps', to keep the scheduled play in Zimbabwe where there is to be five-week tour later this year.New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has condemned the tour stating, "Zimbabwe has just had a rigged election, which has produced a result which is simply unbelievable. I ... wouldn't go near it."  But she refused to ban the tour, placing the onus instead on New Zealand Cricket.The ICC may fine New Zealand up to US$2 million dollars for not attending the tour. England cricket, though, just bought its way out of playing two test matches at a cost of $400,000.In 1981 there were nationwide protests during the South African Springbok rugby tour. Several games were cancelled due to the protests.The New Zealand national rugby team has defeated the Irish equivalent 21-11 in a home rugby test match at Wellington's Westpac Stadium. New Zealand has not lost to Ireland for 103 years, with one draw being the closest Ireland have come to a victory.The score was tied at 11-11 with 20 minutes remaining in what was New Zealand's first match since exiting the World Cup. However, New Zealand's All Blacks were able to break through Ireland's defences to score a victory.Conditions at Westpac were unusually bitter for the match. "I don't know if I've played in much colder than that," said Irish captain Brian O'Driscoll, and similar thoughts were echoed from All Black counterpart Richie McCaw. "It's probably the coldest game I've ever played in. I've never got cold out on the field but after half-time I was shivering. It was nasty."New Zealand centre Conrad Smith commented that "There was one point there are the end when one of the Irishmen went down that both teams were running around in circles doing their own thing (to keep warm). I just looked around and thought 'this is stupid'."Graham Henry, All Black coach, said that he felt the match had been "a lottery."South Africa crashed out of the 2011 Cricket World Cup after being beaten by New Zealand in the quarterfinals, played at Mirpur, in Bangladesh. Chasing a victory target of 222, South Africa were all out for 172 after some inspired bowling performance by Jacob Oram and Nathan McCullum.Earlier South Africa restricted the kiwis for 221 for the loss of 8 wickets. Afterward, Jesse Ryder top scored for NZ with 83 runs while Ross Taylor scored 43. Morne Morkel took three wickets while fast bowler Steyn and Spinner Imran Tahir took two wickets each.South Africa collapsed from 121 for three wickets and lost the final seven wickets for 51 runs. McCullum, who opened the bowling for NZ, took three wickets while Oram took another four wickets and triggered a collapse.NZ will now play either Srilanka or England in the semi-finals. India will take on Pakistan in the other semi-final.The International Federation of Netball Associations announced the decision today that New Zealand has secured the rights to host the World Netball Championships in 2007 after Fiji were stripped of the rights following their military coup this year.Kareyn Smith, vice president of the IFNA, said: "New Zealand was really the only viable option, and participating nations will just have to accept it. One big issue which will have to be looked at is the number of people who had already booked to travel to Fiji for the tournament in July, including more than 1,000 New Zealanders."New Zealand has been given extra time to prepare for the two week event, with the postponement of the championship's start from July to November. Ruth Aitken, coach of New Zealand's netball team, the Silver Ferns, said that the time they have to prepare is usually when the team has its rest period. However she is delighted that New Zealand is the host.Netball New Zealand has not yet announced the venue where the championships will be played but have announced that it will be either Auckland or Christchurch. Don Mackinnon, chair of the Netball New Zealand board, said that other venues are not being considered because it would become too difficult because of the time constraints. The decision will be announced within the next couple weeks.New Zealand are the current world champions since winning the last championships held in Jamaica. New Zealand also held the championship in 1999.Australia was unable to host the championships as they could not prepare in the allocated time. Jamaica and England both showed interest in hosting the championships.The New Zealand A1GP team, with racer Jonny Reid, placed seventh in A1GP feature race and picked up four championship points in the second round at Brno track, Czech Republic.New Zealand managed to secure themselves first place in the qualifying race by being fastest in all four qualifying segments with a time of 3:30.053, Germany second with 3:30.524. This put New Zealand in the pole position to start the sprint race. When racing for the 20 minute sprint race started Germany and New Zealand 'locked horns' before the very first corner. It ended with both cars crashing out of the race. This crash made both New Zealand and Germany start from the end of the track for the feature race.New Zealand managed to crawl their way back to get seventh place, but dropped to fourteenth place from twelfth, out of 23 competing nations, on the leader board with only five points.David Sears, Engineering Team Director for both Germany and New Zealand, said: "Reid and his German counterpart Nico Hülkenberg were warned about keeping apart...but still ended up making life difficult for themselves."Sears added: "To finish first you must first finish and the track is incredibly wide here at Brno, so why New Zealand and Germany should be rubbing wheels on the very first corner is anyone's guess. To recover and finish strongly was encouraging for Jonny and the car certainly has the raw speed and looks to be one of the quickest going around. That's the pleasing part amid the disappointment and we now need to refocus and prepare for the next month's round in China.""We were so much quicker than the other teams in qualifying that it would be criminal to be banging wheels when a great result is there for the taking."The next A1GP race takes place on November 12 in Beijing.With the IPC Alpine World Championships officially ending Wednesday with the conclusion of the national team non-medal friendly competition a day after the competition's official closing ceremony, New Zealand's Adam Hall and Corey Peters have completed their run.  Their country did not compete in the team competition as they did not have enough skiers to form a team.With their first event the second race of the competition, Hall finished ninth in the men's standing Super-G with a time of 1:16.65, 4.16 seconds off the winning time set by Austrian Markus Salcher.  Peters finished the Super-G with a time of 1:18.95 in the men's sitting group for a 22 place finish in a field of 25 skiers.Hall had his best finish at the Championships on the third day of competition when he earned a bronze medal in the Slalom.  Peters did not fair as well, earning a Did Not Finish (DNF) during his second run in the Slalom and consequently not ranking.In the Super Combined, Hall finished ninth with a combined run time of 1:49.87, 7.43 seconds slower than first place finisher Austrian Matthias Lanzinger. Peters's problems continued, as he earned a DNF during his first run.Peters finished tenth in the Giant Slalom, with a combined run time of 2:37.73, 21.93 seconds slower than Japanese gold medalist Taiki Morri. Hall skipped the event.Despite New Zealand's small size, the country has a history of doing well at the Winter Paralympics.  Most recently, the country saw success when Hall won a gold medal in the men's standing event at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver.29-year-old William Trubridge from New Zealand set a new freediving record on Sunday, reaching a depth of 116 metres (380 feet) in the Atlantic Ocean, holding his breath for four minutes nine seconds — breaking the world record for the deepest free immersion dive.Wearing a silicon-coated wetsuit, Trubridge plunged into world's deepest blue hole in a bay west of Clarence Town on Long Island, Bahamas. Dean's Blue Hole is 202 metres (663 ft) deep. Using breaststroke and fins to decend, he said “It was hard to get the tag from the bottom as I struggled with some narcosis". "[I] wasted some time fumbling for the tag, then set off for the surface. I had to use my arms a little from 20m".Trubridge already held nine world records, and the dive put him into first place in the "Vertical Blue Suunto Dive-Off" competition.  Earlier in the tournament he broke the record for a "constant weight, no fins" unassisted dive to 92m (301ft) — the first person to reach the 300ft unaided.There are many different classes of freediving. For breath-hold diving, there is with- and without-fins, and with/without 'assistance', such as a weighted sled.This record was for "Constant Weight Apnea with fins", where the diver cannot drop any weights during the dive, and follows a guide line, but cannot touch it. They may use fins to descend, but on the ascent they pull themselves up with the rope. Divers retrieve a velcro tag from a metal plate placed at a certain depth. The record was previously held by Austrian Herbert Nitsch, who reached a depth of  92m (301ft) on 19 April 2010. The 'no limits' record, in which competitors can use a weighted sled, is 214m (702 ft).Newcastle United appointed Sam Allardyce as manager on May 15, following the resignation of Glenn Roeder on May 6.Allardyce had turned the opportunity to manage Newcastle down when offered it in the past as he chose to stay on as manager of Bolton Wanderers. However, Allardyce's eight year stint as Bolton manager came to an end following his resignation on April 29, 2007. Allardyce cited that his need for a rest as well as his desire to win silverware was behind his decision.When asked what made Newcastle a more likely destination for trophies than Bolton, he replied: "Everything about it. The resources, the facilities, the fans, the amount of revenue that can be generated by a club of this size. No disrespect to Bolton, it is a club I love, but this club is massive in terms of what it can achieve."The naming rights for St James' Park, the home ground of English football club Newcastle United F.C., are to be put up for sale.  The club stated that the club would be "welcoming offers for the stadium naming rights next season".  The move was part of a new drive to "maximise its commercial revenues", after the announcement that owner Mike Ashley was not selling the club, which had been up for sale since May 2009.St James' Park is the largest and oldest football stadium in North East England. Football had been played at St James' Park since 1880, with Newcastle United using it as their home ground since their inception, in 1892. Despite Newcastle being in the second tier of football, St James Park is the third largest club football stadium in England, behind Old Trafford and the Emirates Stadium.Naming rights is not unprecedented in English football, including the Premier League grounds the Britannia Stadium, DW Stadium, Emirates Stadium, KC Stadium and Reebok Stadium. Bookmakers Ladbrokes named sportswear company and current club sponsor Addidas favourites to secure the rights. In order to stop the move, BBC Radio Newcastle football commentator Mick Lowes suggested that the Newcastle United Supporters Trust's used part of its reported £25m funds to pay Ashley not to sell the rights.Ex-Newcastle striker and local sports pundit Malcolm Macdonald said of the decision:they thought they had got on the wrong side of the people of Tyneside then just wait and see what happens if they go through with their plans to re-name St James’ Park because there will be an almighty uproar and outcry. It would upset people so much because it everyone’s second home. That is how people feel about it. It has been St James’ Park forever and a day and it should remain that way.Lee Ryder, the Evening Chronicle's chief sportswrite blogged:We need to make Coors Light Park a fortress" - to even imagine a future Toon player uttering such words will make many physically sick...Renaming St James's Park is simply bad taste in the eyes of most Geordie fans - and many will feel that even the injection of silly money to do it will do nothing to make up for another piece of heritage being ripped away from the Tyneside streets....Renaming St James's Park to Coors Light Park, Bwin Park or even the McDonalds Arena shows that Newcastle's top brass have again got it so seriously wrongGeorge Caulkin of The Times wrote of the decision:Renaming St James’ Park is a muddle-headed, flawed and divisive notion which must not and cannot stand. In an era of recession, there may be a need for Newcastle, in their own words, to “maximise their commercial revenues,” but if it comes at the expense of goodwill (what little there is left of it), hope and a sense of community, it would also come at a bitter, prohibitive, self-defeating cost. There has been debate over the correct spelling and pronunciation of the stadium name, with differing accounts based on its meaning and origin. In 2008, the club insisted to the BBC programme Look North that the the correct spelling of the Stadium is St James' Park, with no following 's' after James', because the stadium is not named as "the park of St James", rather, it is named after the nearby St James Street, which predates the ground.The announcement came on the same day as it announced Chris Hughton as the club's permanent manager, and that owner Mike Ashley was taking the club off the market for a second time.The only real animal out of the bunch, Mukmuk, shouldn't be stuck with second billing among 2010 Winter Olympic mascots, says the Vancouver Sun newspaper.Mukmuk was introduced on November 27, 2007, along with Miga, Quatchi, and Sumi, the Olympic and Paralympic mascots. However, he only appeared in the introductory video and on the website, while the three others appear in costumed character form around the country, and as merchandise "created in effigy by the thousands".Only 205 Vancouver Island marmots are known to exist, due to predators (mostly wolves and eagles), and loggers.Writer Jeff Lee is asking readers to join their "campaign to make him a real, live mascot instead of a virtual sidekick". He's asking for public opinion to send to The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (or simply, "Vanoc") on why Mukmuk would make a good mascot, or even why he wouldn't.Lee will be regularly writing articles for the paper, as well as blogging, publishing reader thoughts, drawings, and ideas of "who Mukmuk really is"; all the other characters have detailed back stories.According to press materials, "Mukmuk is a small and friendly Vancouver Island marmot who always supports and cheers loudly for his friends during games and races. When he is not hibernating or sunbathing on rocks and logs, he enjoys getting out to meet other types of marmots and animals. In fact, this is how he became friends with the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic mascots."The Vancouver Sun first received reader feedback sympathetic to Mukmuk, as a Nanaimo resident wrote in, noting their paper was the only one to even picture the character. The other three appeared on newspaper covers through BC and nationwide, once launched.An online petition launched at an unknown date before December 4 has only gathered 18 signatures.On Friday, Catalonian football club FC Barcelona announced Brazilian forward Neymar signed a five-year contract extension, which runs through June 2021.Barcelona announced Neymar would be signing a contract extension in July, but Neymar was not physically present at their offices to sign at the time.Neymar joined the Blaugrana in summer 2013 from Santos FC and since then has featured in 151 games for the Catalonian club. Neymar has won nine trophies with Barça — two La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys and Supercopa de España, and one each of UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup scoring over 90 goals.Per the contract extension, Neymar's buyout clause is €200 million at the end of the current season which would rise to €250million by the third season.After signing the contract extension, Neymar said, "I feel at home [...] I am very happy with colleagues on the field" ((ca))Catalonia language: ‍Em sento a casa [...] Em sento molt feliç a dins del camp amb els companys.The NFL has announced that its "farmer-league" NFL Europa has been discontinued after 15 seasons. Instead, the NFL will change "the focus of its international business strategy to presenting the NFL to the widest possible global audience, including broader media visibility and the staging of international regular-season games." "The time is right to re-focus the NFL's strategy on initiatives with global impact, including worldwide media coverage of our sport and the staging of live regular-season NFL games,'" said Mark Waller, senior vice president of NFL International, to NFL.comThe NFL is focusing on the international market now. In October, the owners passed a resolution to set up to two regular-season games in international stadiums per year. The first of these games will be played at Wembley Stadium in London on October 28 when the Miami Dolphins and New York Giants meet.In 2006, NFL Europa changed its name from NFL Europe to NFL Europa to focus more on the German and Dutch markets. When NFL Europa shut down, it had six teams based in Holland and Germany. The Hamburg Sea Devils won the last World Bowl (number 15) last Saturday. Two of the players that were developed in NFL Europa were Arizona Cardinals QB Kurt Warner and Indianapolis Colts K Adam Vinatieri.The owners of the teams of the National Football League agreed Wednesday night at 7:35 p.m. EDT--25 minutes before a final deadline of 8:00 p.m. EDT--to a collective bargaining agreement extension proposal put together by the NFL Players Association.  The final vote was 30-2, with Ralph Wilson of the Buffalo Bills and Mike Brown of the Cincinnati Bengals voting no.Faced with a severely limiting salary cap of US$94.5 million in 2006 and the total loss of the salary cap in 2007, potentially ending the era of parity in the NFL, the owners' final caveat was not with the NFLPA, but with themselves.  They were arguing over the continuation of revenue sharing, and how it should proceed through the CBA extension.  In the end, owners agreed to a three-tiered revenue sharing system:  The top five revenue teams would each pay the highest share into the revenue sharing pool, teams 6-10 would each pay the middle share, and teams 11-15 would each pay the lowest share.  The lower 17 teams would then split the revenue sharing pool.The CBA extension permits the salary cap to rise to $102 million for the 2006 season, and $109 million for 2007.  It also extends the maximum proration period for signing bonuses to five years in 2006, then six years in 2007, before returning to five years in 2008.The owners and the NFLPA have been working on a CBA extension for nearly two years.  If the deadline had passed Wednesday night, then the current CBA would have ended after the 2007 season, with the owners fearing a strike and a possible challenge from another professional football league, like the USFL in the mid-1980s.  This fear is substantiated by the 2004-05 strike in the NHL, during which an unsuccessful challenge was made by a re-formed World Hockey Association.After a very close offensive battle throughout the game, the Arizona Cardinals defeated the Green Bay Packers 51-45 in an overtime thriller today in the wild card round of the NFL Playoffs. The game was won after Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers fumbled the ball during overtime, resulting in Arizona's Karlos Dansby recovering the ball and returning it for a touchdown, giving the Cardinals the sudden death victory. Arizona coach Ken Whisenhunt called the contest "...Probably one of the best games ever played in the playoffs", while Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said that it was "The toughest loss I've ever been a part of." Both team's strong offenses were evident throughout the entire game. The two team's offensive totals combined to reach a massive 1,024 yards, with the Cardinals gaining 531 and the Packers 493. In the first quarter, the Cardinals got out to a quick start, when cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie intercepted an errant Rodgers throw and returned it for a touchdown. On Green Bay's very next possession, wide receiver Donald Driver fumbled, setting up another quick Arizona touchdown and making the score 14-0 in favor of the Cardinals. An Arizona field goal by Neil Rackers made it a 17-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.The Packers began to show some of their offensive firepower in the second quarter. To start the quarter, Rodgers led the team down the field in a 52-yard drive that lead to a Rodgers sneak at the goal line to give the Packers their first points of the game. However, the Cardinals quickly countered with a scoring drive of their own, capped off by a 15-yard passing touchdown from quarterback Kurt Warner to receiver Early Doucet. At the end of the half, Green Bay kicked a field goal to cut into the deficit which was still quite large, a 24-10 halftime edge for Arizona. Warner and Rodgers both showed explosive passing throughout the next half. In the third, both quarterbacks threw two touchdown passes to make the score 38-24, the Cardinals still holding the edge. Green Bay began to mount their comeback in the fourth quarter. They began with two touchdowns, tying the game at 38. Warner again countered with another passing score for Arizona, giving them a one touchdown edge with under 3 minutes to play. Then, Rodgers led the Packers in a quick drive, scoring and tying the game at 45 all. The match now had to be decided in overtime.Green Bay won the overtime coin toss, giving them the advantage of having the ball first in the sudden death period. However, the key mistake of the game came here. On the Packers' third play, Aaron Rodgers fumbled, creating a Karlos Dansby recovery which he returned for a touchdown, ending the offensive shootout with a final score of 51-45.After the win, Arizona is now focused on advancing further in the playoffs, as well as rumors on Warner's possible retirement. "I don't think you every want to stay too long, but you never want to go out before it's time," said Warner. "The hard part is trying to figure that out, but right now it's about another playoff game. It's about New Orleans and then we'll go from there."The Cardinals play the New Orleans Saints in next week's divisional round.Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick and three other men were indicted on Tuesday by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy related to a dog fighting operation. The charges included buying, breeding and training pit bull dogs, transporting the dogs across state lines to illegally participate in fights, and gambling on the fights.The indictments stemmed from a search of Vick's Smithfield, Virginia home in April, in which 54 pit bulls were removed, along with equipment used in dog fighting.The indictment said that Vick had bought the property in Smithfield for US$34,000 to run the dog fighting under the name "Bad Newz Kennels" with two other people named in the indictment. Purnell Peace, Quanis Phillips, and Tony Taylor were all named in the indictment along with Vick.The indictment stated that Vick took part in the killing of eight dogs that didn't pass test fights, called "rolling". The pit bulls were allegedly killed by hanging, drowning and slamming at least one dog onto the ground. If convicted of both portions of the conspiracy charge, Vick could face six years in prison and a $350,000 fine. His property, located in Surry County, would be subject to forfeiture under U.S. laws dealing with illegal activities that are carried out at an interstate level. The indictment alleges that the dog fighting operation, involving American Pit Bull Terriers, spilled over into Alabama, North Carolina and New York.Vick has a court date on July 26 for a bond hearing and to hear the charges. Vick has said that he had a kennel operation on the property, but had no involvement or knowledge of a dog fighting ring.Instead of returning to practise from a fractured finger today as scheduled, flamboyant Dallas Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens is instead recovering at Baylor Medical Center this morning from an apparent suicide attempt last night. A female friend who was with Owens last night observed him taking several prescription pain killers and behaving erratically. She called 911 and Owens was rushed to the hospital.Original reports stated that Owens was suffering from an adverse reaction to the pain medication, which he was taking for a fractured hand. But this morning, Dallas police have reported that Owens took an unknown large amount of the pills, and when asked by police this morning if he had been attempting to hurt himself, Owens replied, "Yes." Paramedics have only confirmed that they called police to report that they were bringing Owens to hospital.Owens has since said that he was not attempting suicide.Atlanta Flacons quarterback Michael Vick plead guilty to federal charges surrounding illegal dogfighting yesterday.Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, told the NFL Network he is, "not really surprised" by the news of his quarterback's plea. "From a personal standpoint, he's doing the right thing...That's been my counsel to him some while ago, and publicly as well, to get this behind him as quickly as he can," Blank said. However, Blank could not talk about Vick's future as a Falcon player. Sources reported that Vick's attorneys had hoped to receive notification from that National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell's office concerning Vick's NFL future before he plead guilty. However, that reportedly never happened.Defense attorney Billy Martin said, "After consulting with his family this weekend Michael Vick asked that I announce today that he has reached an agreement with federal prosecutors regarding the charges pending against him...Mr. Vick has agreed to enter a plea of guilty to the charges and accept full responsibility for his actions and the mistakes he has made. Michael wishes to apologize everyone who has been hurt by this matter."Vick is scheduled to appear in a federal courtroom on August 27 in Richmond, Virginia.The maximum term for the charges Vick plead guilty to is believed to be five years in jailtime and a $250,000 citation. However, sentencing guidelines likely would dictate less. Vick's defense attorneys did not release specific details concerning the plea agreement.Quarterback Brett Favre has been traded to the New York Jets for a conditional fourth-round draft selection in the 2009 NFL Draft. The trade was later confirmed by ESPN and the Jets themselves. The multiple National Football League record-holder was the starting quarterback of the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to the end of the 2007 NFL season. Favre, 38, announced his retirement on March 6, 2008 after much speculation over his future.After a long dispute with the Packers' management, Favre was reinstated by the NFL and was pursued in trade discussions with the Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Jets were much more aggressive than the Buccaneers in their pursuit of Favre all along, offering a conditional fourth-round draft choice in the 2009 NFL Draft which could be promoted to a first-round selection based on performance criteria."Brett has had a long and storied career in Green Bay, and the Packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished," the Packers said in a press release. Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum said of the trade, "We just felt like this was an opportunity to go get somebody of Brett's stature and what he's accomplished."The trade caps a roller-coaster off-season ride for Favre and the franchise that became synonymous with his legendary No. 4 jersey, which was planned to be retired in the Packers' home opening game. Favre's on-again, off-again retirement has monopolized headlines for the past two months as news began trickling to the media that the legendary passer was second-guessing both his retirement decision and his status in Green Bay. Favre was offered a $20 million dollar marketing contract from the Packers to remain retired. Now, the Jets may have to clear cap space in order to have Favre on their roster — who is due to make $12 million this season — which may call for the release of Chad Pennington. A comment from Jets GM Tannenbaum all but confirmed the release of Pennington. "It's a bittersweet moment for us. I have all the respect in the world for Chad as a person, as a player," Tannenbaum said, adding that an announcement on a transaction involving Pennington will come later Thursday.The Packer's official website states that they will be holding press conferences at noon and 2:00 p.m. CDT and more information will be released then.The Chicago Bears confirmed Tuesday that they had traded running back Thomas Jones along with one of their second round picks (which was 63rd overall) in the 2007 draft to the New York Jets. In exchange they will receive the Jet's second round pick, which is 37th overall in the upcoming NFL Draft and originally belonged to the Washington Redskins.Jones rushed for 1,210 yards last season with the Bears and 301 yards in the playoffs including 112 yards on 15 carries in Super Bowl XLI against the Colts. Jones (who will be 29 next season) who originally signed with the Bears for a four year $10 million deal as a free agent prior to 2004. His contract was set to expire after 2007. After his 1,335 yard 2005 season (which included nine touchdowns) Jones expressed his unhappiness with his contract by boycotting the Bears' offseason voluntary workouts. Shortly after the Super Bowl, Jones expressed his desire for a change to Bears general manager Jerry Angelo. At a scouting combine two weeks ago he hinted a trade might be in the works, saying of Jones "He’s expressed some things to me personally. We’ll work on some things. I told him I would listen, and I did." Had Jones stayed with the Bears in 2007 he would have made $2.75 million. The contract with the Jets (arranged by his agent Drew Rosenhaus) is for four years and is worth $20 million with a $12 million guaranteed signing bonus. Having passed his physical for the Jets, Jones is set to receive $13.1 million in the deal's first two years. Reflecting on the trade Jones said "It wasn't really a situation where I wanted to be traded. It was a situation where I wanted to have an opportunity to do what I am capable of doing and that's going somewhere and providing leadership like I did in Chicago." He looked forward to playing with the Jets "I had a great time in Chicago, and it was a great experience playing there and making it to the Super Bowl last year with those guys. But I'm very, very excited to be here in New York. It's a great city. We had a chance to play the Jets this year, and the energy and the excitement that we felt up here at the Meadowlands and just being in New York in general was something that was special." Jones also addressed concerns about his age, saying "I'll be 29 years old this year, but I haven't had a lot of carries for a 29-year-old back and I'm a workout warrior. I love working out, I love taking care of my body and I'm very in tune with my body and how I feel. The way I feel right now, I could play for a long, long time."Last season the Jets ranked 30th in rushing in the NFL, and the trade gives the Jets the starting running back they have lacked since Curtis Martin's knee injury over a year ago (Martin did not play last season and is expected to retire). Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum was happy about the trade, stating “We did a lot of research on Thomas as a person, and we think he's a good fit on and off the field. He's a tough, outdoor, northeast runner, and he provides leadership.” Jones will be sharing running duties with Leon Washington, and Cedric Houston (the Jets released their two other running backs Derrick Blaylock and Kevan Barlow). Last year Houston totaled up 374 rushing yards while Washington led the team with 650. Jones spoke of his admiration of his new teammate, saying "Leon Washington is a great back. I watched him last year, and he made some great plays for the Jets, helped them get to the playoffs. I have a lot of respect for him and all the other running backs out there. I'm one of the guys on the team that just wants to provide leadership and make plays and help us win." When asked if he expected to get most of the rushing duty Jones said "The best players play, and that's a great situation to be in. It gives you an opportunity to go out there and compete. Competition makes everybody better." The addition of Jones will give the Jets the option of using Washington and Houston as situational runners, which many believe will be increase their effectiveness. The Jets' general manager Tannenbaum stressed that the coaching staff would determine such questions, but said of Brown "I think he's a complete back, in terms of, he can be on the field for all three downs. How he's used and in what role will ultimately be determined by [Head Coach] Eric [Mangini] and Coach Schottenheimer, but he's a guy who can come in here and add to the productivity of the team."In place of Jones, the Bears are expected to start Cedric Benson. Benson was the fourth overall pick in the first round of the 2005 draft and is playing for the Bears under a $35 million contract. Benson rushed for 647 yards last season, averaging 4.1 yards per carry. Benson was injured in the Super Bowl after 2 carries for a 1 yard loss. Both Jones and Benson served the Bears as tailbacks, and (baring injury) were substituted for one another every couple of series. Bears general manager Angelo said of Benson "It's his time. It's that simple. It's his time. We feel strongly that he is ready." Angelo dismissed questions surrounding Benson's hardiness (a sprained knee in 2005 kept him out of six games, and last season he suffered a shoulder injury at training camp and a sprained knee in the Super Bowl). Angelo pointed out "He’s been hurt, [but] he never was hurt in college. He had a lot of carries and four 1,000-yard seasons."While many in Chicago view Jones' relationship with his teammates, and Benson in particular as icy, he had only complimentary things to say when discussing the trade and its effects. He told reporters "Cedric Benson has a lot of talent. He's a talented guy. When you move into the featured role, there are a lot more responsibilities. Coach Tim Spencer is a great running backs coach and I had a great relationship with him, not only as a coach but as a friend. He has so much advice for me to make me a better football player and I'm sure he'll pass that same advice to Cedric."The Bears have declared their intent to have special-teams standout Adrian Peterson serve as a complementary player to Benson. While Peterson only had 10 carries last season, in 2005 he led the Bears with 76 carries at an average of 5.1 yards. General manager Angelo stated “We feel good about Cedric and Adrian. We still feel we have two quality running backs. That was a part of why we did what we did. We'll continue to look for a running back because we want to carry three running backs on the roster.”The Bears top draft positions are now 31st overall in the first round, and their new acquisition of 37th overall in the second round. The Jets top draft positions are both in the second round, the 59th overall and the newly acquired 63rd overall.The Jets also announced they signed 13-year veteran Bobby Hamilton to defensive back and Kenyon Coleman (six year veteran from Dallas) to defensive end. The Bears announced the 49ers’ offensive assistant Pep Hamilton would succeed Wade Wilson (who went to Dallas) as quarterback coach, and Charles London (formerly Duke’s assistant running back coach) would take over Mike Bajakian’s offensive quality-control coach position since he left to become offensive coordinator at Central Michigan.The NFL Season has kicked off as the Indianapolis Colts hosted the New Orleans Saints Thursday night. Peyton Manning and the Colts took their first step to defending their Super Bowl Championship by beating the New Orleans Saints by a score of 41-10.  At the half the scored was knotted at 10-10, but Indianapolis showed off their offensive weapons in the second half. Peyton Manning threw for three touchdowns, passed for 288 yards and had zero interceptions. Reggie Wayne caught seven passes, two for touchdowns, for 115 yards, while Marvin Harrison had four receptions, one for a touchdown, for 83 yards.

Officials are calling the incident private and said charges are not likely to be filed. As of Thursday, the Cowboys have not disciplined Jones.Police were notified by hotel staff after workers heard a disturbance in the hotel lobby men's bathroom where Jones and his bodyguard arguing. Jones and his bodyguard told police everything was fine and were driven away by a friend. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones spoke with members of the media on Thursday, saying that he was "very disappointed in that we're having to deal with this," saying that the altercation was not a big deal."They were literally kidding each other," Jerry Jones told the Associated Press on Thursday. "They were jiving around ... and all of a sudden one of them starting saying some things, and here you go."Cowboys nose tackle Tank Johnson said everything was overblown and shouldn't distract the team."This is not that big of a deal," Johnson told the Associated Press. "Nobody's in jail, nobody's in trouble, nobody's hurt. We're all here ready to practice, ready to work."National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell told ESPN radio that he was frustrated that the league was even discussing the incident involving Jones and his bodyguard. Goodell also said the NFL league is investigating the matter. Jones has already been in police trouble in connection with a shooting at a Las Vegas strip club and other incidents which have led to his arrest six times since he was drafted in 2005 by the Tennessee Titans. Jones was suspended in April 2007 by Goodell and allowed to return to play in August.Jones said this after his reinstatement: "I know my responsibilities to the NFL and I'm going to hold my own and do what I need to do to make sure I stay where I am right now, which is reinstated. I work hard every day to make sure I don't make the same mistakes. Can I say I would never ever make the same mistakes? No, I can't say that. I'll make sure I put myself in way better situations than I have put myself in the past."The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team in the Eastern Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the  NFL. They are based in the Dallas suburb of Irving.Takeo Spikes is no longer a member of the  Buffalo Bills. Spikes was involved in a trade Monday that sent the 2-time Pro-Bowl linebacker, as well as backup quarterback Kelly Holcomb to the  Philadelphia Eagles for defensive tackle  Darwin Walker and an undisclosed draft pick, probably in a later round of the  draft. Of Spikes, Eagles general manager  Tom Heckert said: "Takeo Spikes is a proven playmaker in the  National Football League." Heckert added, "He has the ability to play all three  linebacking positions and were happy to add him to our defense."Spikes has dealt with injuries throughout his career, missing 13 games in 2005 with an Achillies tendon injury. He also missed four games this past season with problems in his hamstring. Despite his injuries, Spikes has been a playmaker for Buffalo, and previously for Cincinnati, rolling up 878 tackles, 21.5 sacks, 12 interceptions, 12 forced fumbles, and 14 fumble recoveries.Kelly Holcomb, also involved in the deal, is 33 years old, with 11 years experience as the backup quarterback in  Indianapolis,  Cleveland, and most recently Buffalo. Holcomb spent the 2006 season behind  J.P. Losman.Darwin Walker is a 7-year veteran of the league. In that time span, Walker has accumulated 170 tackles, 27.5 sacks, and 5 fourced fumbles, as well as 5 recoveries.David Carr, the first pick in Houston Texans history, and the first overall pick of the 2002 NFL Draft was signed Friday by the Carolina Panthers. Carr will serve as backup to current starter Jake Delhomme.Carr, a five-year starting quarterback for the Texans, completed 60 percent of his passes, but threw 65 interceptions and was sacked 249 times. He completed 68.3 percent of his passes last season, a career high. Carr was sacked 249 times in the past five seasons with the Texans, and was released by the organization after they made a trade with the Atlanta Falcons to acquire Matt Schaub, who had served as the backup quarterback to Michael Vick.The Panthers were in need of a quality backup quarterback after releasing seven-year veteran Chris Weinke in March. Weinke had struggled last season, leading the team to a 1-2 record during an injury to Delhomme. The move means the Panthers now have the top two picks from the 2002 draft. Carolina selected defensive end Julius Peppers with No. 2 pick. The Panthers have not done much outside of the Carr deal this off-season, with 21 of last season's 22 starting players returning to the team.The  Houston Texans released quarterback  David Carr, Friday, ending a turbulent start to his five year old career. Carr was the first overall draft pick of the  2002 NFL Draft, the first pick in Texans history. Carr had struggled in Houston, being sacked 249 times during his tenure as quarterback. Despite throwing 59 touchdowns with the Texans, Carr threw 65 interceptions in the same time, compiling a 75.5 QB rating. Carr had high numbers at  Fresno State when the Texans selected him with the first overall pick in 2002. Houston's all time record under David Carr is 8-24.It became evident that Houston no longer required Carr's services after the organization made a trade with the  Atlanta Falcons to acquire QB  Matt Schaub earlier this week. The deal included swapping first round picks in the upcoming draft, with the Falcons moving up from 10th to 8th overall pick. After acquiring Schaub, it was announced that he would become the new starting quarterback for the Texans, and that the organization would attempt to trade Carr.The Texans also released runningback  Domanick Williams. Williams, formerly known as Domanick Davis, leaves as the Texans all-time rushing leader with 3,195 rushing yards. Davis spent the entire  2006 NFL season on the injured reserve with a knee injury.Marshall Faulk, the National Football League's 9th all time rushing yards leader is expected to announce his retirement from professional football March 26th at the NFL's annual owners meeting in Phoenix, Arizona.The St. Louis Rams runningback released this statement, "It has been an honor and pleasure to play in the National Football League. I'd like to thank all my teammates and coaches with whom I've been associated over the past 13 seasons as well as the fans who supported me throughout the years. I gave the game my passion, and it gave me a wonderful career and memories that I will always be thankful for."Faulk played for San Diego State University before being drafted by Indianapolis in 1994. After five seasons with the Colts, Faulk was traded to the St. Louis Rams, where he would lead the team to a Super Bowl championship. Faulk spent the entire 2006 NFL season on the injured reserve after having major reconstructive knee surgery.Besides ranking 9th in career rushing yards with 12,279, Faulk ends his 13 year pro career with 100 career touchdowns, tied for sixth all-time. Faulk was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 2000, after setting an NFL single-season record for rushing touchdowns in a single season with 26. He was also named the Offensive Player of the Year three times in his career.The Green Bay Packers defeated the Detroit Lions on Sunday evening by a final score of 31–21, effectively ending the Lions' season with an 0-16 record. The game was played at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin and was televised by Fox in the United States. Kickoff was at 1:00 p.m. EDT. The Lions became the first National Football League franchise to complete an "imperfect season" (without a victory) since the introduction of the 16-game schedule in the 1978 NFL season. The winless season comes just a year after the New England Patriots did the reverse, accomplishing the NFL's first "perfect" 16-0 regular season.After trailing the game 14–0 entering the second quarter, Detroit rallied back to tie the game at 14 by the end of the third quarter. The Packers took a 10-point lead halfway through the fourth quarter with a field goal by kicker Mason Crosby (Green Bay 17 - Detroit 14) and then a touchdown pass from quarterback Aaron Rodgers to fullback John Kuhn (Green Bay 24 - Detroit 14). The Lions fought back with a rushing touchdown by Kevin Smith which left Detroit within three points of tying the game. However, just 11 seconds later, the Packers took possession and Aaron Rodgers completed a 71-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver (Green Bay 31 - Detroit 21). The Packers held on to the lead for the remainder of the game to seal their sixth victory on the season.Lions quarterback Dan Orlovsky was 22-of-42 for 225 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. Calvin Johnson led the Lions in receiving with 102 yards and touchdowns. Kevin Smith led the Lions in rushing with 92 yards and one touchdown.For the Packers, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was 21-of-31 for 308 yards and three touchdowns, and running backs Ryan Grant and DeShawn Wynn rushed for 106 yards each. Wide receivers Donald Driver and Greg Jennings led the Packers in receiving, both tallying over 100 yards.Prior to the Lions' loss on Sunday, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were the only franchise since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger to finish a season without a victory or a tie. The 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers finished their season with a 0-14 record. It was the Buccaneers franchise's first season in the NFL. Tampa Bay also lost the first 12 games of the 1977 season, and the team's 26-game losing streak is still the longest in NFL history. The 1982 Baltimore Colts were the most recent NFL team to not win a game in their respective season, failing to win in the strike-shortened 1982 season, posting an 0-8-1 record.The Lions' loss was closely watched by some members of the 1976 Buccaneers team, including defensive end Pat Toomay. Toomay told reporters, "I would like the torch to be passed...At the same time, you don't want to wish that on anybody." Toomay also pointed out that although the Buccaneers lost every game in their inaugural season, the team reached the NFC Championship Game in their fourth season (1979).Steve Spurrier, the quarterback for the Buccaneers in the 1976 season, voiced his support for the Lions in their quest to win their first game of the season, hoping that only the Buccaneers would hold the distinction of finishing an "imperfect season.""I want that record," Spurrier said. "I'm pulling for them, sure," Spurrier added. "That's the American thing to do, isn't it?"Entering the game, the Lions were 10½-point underdogs against the Packers in spread betting. Lions tackle Gosder Cherilus likened the team's chance to avoid the 0-16 finish as a championship game. "It's our Super Bowl," Cherilus told reporters on Friday, December 27.The Lions surpassed the 1980 New Orleans Saints with their 15th consecutive loss on December 21 to become the first team in NFL history to lose the first 15 games of the season. The 1980 Saints lost their first 14 games, but won their 15th game against the New York Jets.The closest margin that the Lions came to within victory was two points, which came against the Minnesota Vikings on October 12. Minnesota won the game by a score of 12–10. The 1976 Buccaneers suffered five shutout losses (in which they did not score a single point) in their winless season. The closest that the Buccaneers came within victory was a 23–20 loss to the Miami Dolphins on October 24, 1976.Prior to the regular season, the Lions won all four of their games in the exhibition season, which do not count in regular season standings or totals.While the loss didn't come without a fight from the Lions, players from the team knew that they would be forever remembered as possibly the worst team in NFL history. "I've got to live with this," Lions center Dominic Raiola said. "I've been here eight years. This is on my résumé.""I don't ever want to be a part of this again," Lions quarterback Dan Orlovsky said. "We haven't won since, November of '07, maybe? I don't even know the last time we won a game." The franchise's last victory in the regular season was on December 23, 2007 against the Kansas City Chiefs.Packers players were just as eager for a victory. Green Bay's quarterback Aaron Rodgers said while their own season was disappointing, they didn't want to be forever remembered as the team that lost to the 0-15 Lions in the final game of the season. "We didn't want to lose, no, we didn't," Rodgers said. "But really it's not on your mind once the game starts. I didn't even think about it until the fans started chanting in the fourth quarter. They played hard, they really did." Packers fans in attendance at Lambeau Field began to chant "0-16" late in the game.With their victory, the Packers finished their 2008 season with a 6-10 record. With the loss, the Lions finished their 79th season since their inception as the Portsmouth Spartans in 1929. It was the Lions' 75th season in Detroit, Michigan. The franchise also secured the first-overall selection in the upcoming 2009 NFL Draft, a spot reserved for the NFL team with the worst record from the previous season entering the upcoming season.After the game, Lions head coach Rod Marinelli declined to comment on his future with the team. Since being hired in 2006, the Lions have had a 10-38 record under Marinelli. The Lions have averaged 11 losses per season since 2001 and now have lost 23 of their last 24 games. The 0-16 record could be a lasting testimony to the Matt Millen era. With Millen as president of the team from 2001 until he was fired on September 24, Detroit won only 31 games. Millen was widely criticized for his handling of the Lions organization, and Lions fans rallied to have him relieved of duties for years.Sean Taylor, starting safety for the Washington Redskins, died this morning from injuries sustained in a shooting Monday in his Miami, Florida home. The hard-hitting safety was a Pro Bowl selection last season, and was second in the National Football League (NFL) this season in interceptions, with five.Police responded to a 911 emergency call by Taylor's girlfriend at 1:45 a.m. EST (UTC-5) Monday morning. "According to a preliminary investigation, it appears that the victim was shot inside the home by an intruder," said Miami-Dade police in a statement. "We do not have a subject description at this time."Taylor's father, Pedro Taylor released a statement on behalf of the family, stating "It is with deep regret that a young man had to come to his end so soon."NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said "We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Sean's family, friends, teammates, and the Redskins' organization. This is a terrible tragedy involving the loss of a young man who leaves behind many people struggling to understand it. Our office is staying in close contact with the Redskins to provide all appropriate support to the club and Sean's family. We also are working to determine the facts surrounding this tragic event."Goodell added that all 32 NFL teams would honor the memory of the late Redskins' star.Redskins' owner Daniel Snyder said, "This is the worst imaginable tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with Sean's family."Miami Dolphins running back Ricky Williams, who has applied for reinstatement to the NFL, told ESPN Radio's Dan Patrick on Friday that he hasn't gotten high on drugs "in maybe three years." Williams credited yoga with replacing drugs to ease stress.Williams was suspended in April 2006 for violating the NFL's Substance Abuse Policy. Reinstatement to the league requires clinical evaluation and sending a hand-written letter to Roger Goodell, commissioner of the NFL. Williams stated: For the most part, as long as you follow the rules, you have a pretty good shot to be reinstated. Half of it is testing and the other half is you have to talk to someone on a weekly basis.During the radio broadcast, Patrick asked Williams when the last time he had been drug tested. Williams' anwser was Two minutes ago. and that he had passed.Williams blamed the high levels of stress involved in playing football with his use of Marijuana. He said the only way to deal with it was "to go home, relax on the couch, roll up a joint and take a couple of puffs."Williams told Patrick during the interview that he hadn't spoken with new Dolphins head coach Cam Cameron yet. Addressing what the Dolphins may or may not choose to do with him, Williams said that he would be "fine with whatever happens."Williams said, when asked why he wants to return to the NFL: "For me, it's a test to see if all this work I've done is really worth something. If I can go to the NFL and have success, that would speak a lot for yoga and what I've learned and offer a lot of people who have dealt with the same issues I have a way out."In the NFL today, the New Orleans Saints traded a sixth-round draft pick to the Miami Dolphins for kicker Olindo Mare. Mare will compete with John Carney, the Saints 44 year old kicker who has had a hard time hitting field goals over 35 yards. The Saints visited with former Dallas Cowboy and Indianapolis Colts kicker Mike Vanderjagt, but never offered anything. The Saints also used kicker Billy Cundiff last year.Over the past ten seasons with the Dolphins, Mare amassed 1,048 points, while converting 245 of 303 field goals and 313 of 318 extra points.Dolphins General Manager Randy Mueller indicated that Miami pursued the trade in hopes of improving future prospects. "Adding another draft pick is another chip that hopefully we can turn into a player for the Dolphins down the road," said Mueller. "We need to build this team a nucleus of young talent that has kind of been void for the last few years," he continued.It had been speculated that Mare might be traded from the Dolphins, since they inked an off-season deal with New York Giants kicker Jay Feely.On New Year's Day, the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League played in the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic, an outdoor game held at Orchard Park, New York's Ralph Wilson Stadium. This was the second outdoor game in league history and the first outdoor game held in the United States.The Penguins won the game 2 to 1 after a shootout in which Sidney Crosby made a goal between the legs of goalie Ryan Miller to win it. Colby Armstrong of the Penguins scored 21 seconds into the game, and Brian Campbell scored the lone goal for the Sabres in the 2nd period.A temporary ice rink was built on the field at Ralph Wilson Stadium, which normally hosts games played by the National Football League's Buffalo Bills. Snow and heavy winds were prevalent throughout the game, and Zambonis were brought out to clear the ice in the middle of each period. The temperature was around the freezing point when the game began at 1:20 p.m. ET.Several rule changes were in effect in order to lessen the impact of the weather on gameplay. These changes included stopping play in the middle of the 3rd period to allow teams to switch sides and dividing the overtime period into two 2:30 segments. In the shootout, the goalies were allowed to choose which side to defend, with both choosing the same side.The attendance for the game was 71,217, beating the record of 57,167 at the Heritage Classic, another outdoor game which was held in 2003 between the Montreal Canadiens and Edmonton Oilers. Two of the Edmonton players in the Heritage Classic, Georges Laraque and Ty Conklin, played for Pittsburgh in the Winter Classic.Tickets to the game were made available to the general public on September 18, 2007; all 41,000 were sold out within 30 minutes.Retired NHL referee Bruce Hood says his high profile may be the reason why he isn’t in the Hockey Hall of Fame.Speaking Wednesday in an exclusive with HockeyRefs.com, he said: "I was honoured to just be nominated. I have been put on the outside of things because of my speaking out on things I believed in."Hood officiated in the NHL for 21 seasons before retiring in 1984. His career included 1,033 regular season and 157 Stanley Cup playoff games, three All-Star Games, and three Canada Cups. A group of Hall of Fame members headlined by former players Bobby Hall and the late Maurice Richard nominated Hood in 1994, but the effort was unsuccessful. Despite that, the former NHLer says he isn’t upset about not being part of the club. Hood also discussed the four-official system, the sport’s evolution over the years, and recent controversies involving the NHL Officiating Department. "I never liked the two-referee system," he added. "It is absolutely ridiculous for referees to be skating backwards into the zone all the time."The National Hockey League and its players union, the NHL Players Association, came to a long sought-after agreement Wednesday over a new NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement, ending a bitter and damaging 301-day lockout of the players. The agreement came after a all-night negotiation session with the union. However, the deal must still be ratified by owners and players. A vote for ratification will be held on Thursday, July 21, 2005.The deal includes a salary cap for players. The combined salary of all players in the league cannot exceed 54% of league-wide revenue. Players who are still under contract will have a 24% rollback.Also in the proposed deal are some rule changes. Smaller goaltending equipment, making two-line passes across the neutral zone (fom blue-line to blue-line) legal, and shootouts at the end of an overtime period in the case of tie games are all rules that will probably be enacted when the new season begins.The lockout was very damaging to the NHL. The league became the first United States sport organization to cancel an entire season. It is the second time the Stanley Cup has not been awarded: the first time was in 1919 during an influenza outbreak.Thursday night's NHL game between the Buffalo Sabres and the Ottawa Senators was a heated game with a fight that involved nearly all players from both teams including the coaches, Lindy Ruff of the Sabres and Bryan Murray of the Senators.The reason for the fight was because Senators player Chris Neil, #25, caught the co-captain of the Sabres, Chris Drury, #23 with an elbow while he wasn't looking. The hit caused the co-captain to fall to the ice, stunned, with a possible concussion. Drury is said to be out for an undetermined amount of time.Shortly after Drury was escorted off the ice, Adam Mair of the Sabres hit Jason Spezza of the Senators just before the face-off following the incident with Drury which sparked the fight between all of the 12 players on both teams, including both goalies, Martin Biron of the Sabres and Ray Emery of the Senators, who were both thrown out of the game. Emery had just returned to the ice rink after he was suspended for three games when he slashed Maxim Lapierre of the Montreal Canadians.During the physical brawl with the players, both coaches Ruff and Murray were yelling at each other and at one point Ruff began to jump over walls separating the two teams from the penalty boxes however neither of the coaches ended up in a physical brawl."When something like that happens to one of your star players, you have to respond. The players did the right thing. You can't respond any other way," said Ruff in regards to the brawl between the players.Murray accuses Ruff of sending several players to the ice in what he says was the initiation of the fight."I put out skill players and he sends out the five guys on his team that are going to start a fight," said Murray.Ruff first denied that he sent players to the ice to start the fight saying "I'm not going to comment on what I had on my mind" in a press conference after the game, but then said he said "go out and run 'em."As a result of the brawl, these penalties were handed out:Ottawa fighting - 5 min   5:13, A. VolchenkovOttawa fighting - 5 min 5:13, R. EmeryOttawa fighting - 5 min 5:13, R. EmeryOttawa goalie leaving crease - 2 min 5:13, R. EmeryOttawa game misconduct - 10 min 5:13, R.

KaletaThe Sabres ended up winning the game 6-5 in a shootout when the only goal of the shootout was scored by Drew Stafford of the Sabres.The Sabres and Senators will play their final game of the season between each other on Saturday February 24 at 7:00 p.m. [EST].The National Hockey League (NHL) handed down a one-game suspension to Anaheim Ducks defenceman Chris Pronger on Sunday for a hit he laid on Dean McAmmond of the Ottawa Senators during Game 3 of the playoff finals Saturday night.Although there was no penalty call on the play, replays showed Pronger's forearm hitting the head of McAmmond, who had to be helped from the ice. McAmmond didn't return for the remainder of the game. The hit occurred at 2:01 of the third period.The league was swift in rendering judgment on Pronger. “A variety of factors were considered in reaching this decision," said Colin Campbell, NHL Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations. "Mr. Pronger used his forearm to deliver a forceful hit to the head of his opponent. Also, his actions caused injury to his opponent."Ottawa's coach Bryan Murray was not surprised at the suspension. "I think the history of Chris Pronger comes into play a little bit," commented Murray. "There was a very obvious elbow to the head."Pronger had been suspended for one game previously in the 2007 playoffs for a similar hit on Tomas Holmstrom of the Detroit Red Wings, which may have influenced the league's decision on the latest hit.McAmmond agreed with the suspension verdict. "I think it should have been a suspension because it was a blow to the head," said McAmmond. "It wasn't incidental. It's not like that couldn't have been avoided."Whether McAmmond will be fit enough to return for Monday's game is not clear. "I'm feeling pretty much the same as I was yesterday, a little bit headachy, not feeling quite right," explained McAmmond. "I'm going to do everything I can, or as little as I can, to feel good tomorrow. I want to play, but at this point in time, I'm not sure."Despite the injury to McAmmond, Ottawa went on to win Game 3 with a score of 5 to 3. The next game is scheduled for Monday night in Ottawa.The Colorado Avalanche beat the Minnesota Wild 2-1 with goalie Peter Budaj's 10th win in March, keeping their playoff hopes alive.Marian Gaborik scored the opener for the Wild only 1:21 into the first period, but answered goals from Justin Lilles and Peter Stastny in the second period lifted the Avalanche to victory.With the win, the Avalanche tied a team record with 11 wins in a month.  Budaj had a 10-0-2 record this March, tying the franchise record for wins in any month. It was set by the Quebec Nordiques's Daniel Bouchard in February 1981.Colorado is five games behind the Calgary Flames in the race for the 8th spot the Western Conference, the last spot for the playoffs. The Flames play the Vancouver Canucks Saturday night and play Colorado Tuesday night.Minnesota lost its third straight game, jeapordizing their chances in their close race with Vancouver for the Northwest Division title.The Boston Bruins won against the Philadelphia Flyers at Boston's historic Fenway Park becoming the first home team to win the NHL Winter Classic in front of a crowd of 38,112 Friday.Before the game began, a ceremonial face-off took place between Bruins' legend Bobby Orr and Flyers' legend Bobby Clarke who represented their respective teams as honorary captains. The first period went by with both teams tied scoreless at 0-0. However, fists went flying, in the first ever Winter Classic fight, between the Bruins' Shawn Thornton and the Flyers' Daniel Carcillo, who was looking to fight. Thornton said of the fight, "It wasn’t about that. He was out there and asked a couple guys. I don’t think it’s anybody else’s job to do that. There’s nobody on the team that has the same role as me. So I went and obliged." Thornton added, "Yeah, first one ever, I guess. You’ve been reminding me about it for the last six months. It happened. Now it’s over and we can stop talking about it."Then at 4:42 in the second period, Danny Syvret, gave the Flyers their first point in what was Syvret's first goal of his NHL career. The game went in the third period with the Flyers leading, 1-0.However, the Bruins made a comeback in the third period on a power play, when former Flyer Mark Reechi tied the game 1-1 with 2:18 left in the period. The game went into "extra innings" at Fenway with both teams battling back forth until the very end with the Bruins' Marco Sturm gained control of the puck from the Flyers' Matt Carle hitting the puck to fellow teammate Patrice Bergeron. Bergeron gained control of the puck and turned it to pass to Sturm who read Bergeron's movement. Sturm tipped the puck into net, winning the game for the Bruins at 3:03 in overtime driving the crowd in Fenway wild as the team swarmed Sturm to congratulate him.Bruins' goalie Tim Thomas also achieved a dream of his as after the game concluded the United States men's national ice hockey team announced it's roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics which included the goalie. The team will play at 2010 Winter Olympics next month in Vancouver, British Columbia. However, the rink in Fenway won't come down just yet, Yesterday at 2PM EDT, the Bruins held the AT&T Legends Classic where former Bruins legends such as Cam Neely and Terry O'Reilly and current Bruins' coach Claude Julien were joined by celebrities such as Worcester, Massachusetts native actor and comedian Denis Leary, along with Kiefer Sutherland and film director Bobby Farrelly with groups facing off in two teams. The game was held despite the snow which has been forecast for the Boston area.Then, on January 8th, a double NCAA college hockey doubleheader will take place at Fenway Park as the women's ice hockey teams of the University of New Hampshire Wildcats and Northeastern University Huskies in the first ever outdoor women's ice hockey game.

Unfortunately for Fleury, Martin Brodeur was one goal better. Brodeur was spectacular in net once again, earning his NHL leading 12th shutout of the season. The Devils only goal of the night was scored by Jamie Langenbrunner on the Power Play, 3:00 into the second period, assisted by Scott Gomez and Patrick Elias.Sabres lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)Brian Campbell and Chris Drury scored two goals each, and the top-seeded Sabres opened the playoffs with an solid 4-1 victory over the New York Islanders before 18,690 at HSBC Arena, in Buffalo, New York. Buffalo goaltender Ryan Miller was very efficient, allowing only one goal in 21 shots. The Islanders backup netminder Wade Dubielewicz filled in for starter Rick DiPietro, who has been bothered by injuries throughout the season.The game was very defensive for the first half of the game, as both teams were only able to notch a goal a piece. Buffalo scored its first goal 9:30 into regulation, and the Islanders had to wait until 6:58 of the second period, when they evened it up. But the game was pretty much a full onslaught of domination by Buffalo as it dominated the shots category.The Sabres scored the game-winner shortly after the midway point of the second period, and dealt another quick blow immediately after they returned to the ice for the third period. The Islanders, no doubt, have their problems to work with in terms of injuries, and the frustration could be felt as they drew a penalty late, which would ultimately seal the deal as Brian Campbell would score his second goal with only 3:25 remaining in regulation.The Eastern Conference series continues at HSBC Arena in Buffalo on Saturday at 7:30 pm EDT, when the Sabres will try to take a 2-0 series lead on the Islanders.The Buffalo Sabres have beat the Ottawa Senators in a score of 3 to 2 in game four of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Ryan Miller, the goalie for the Sabres stopped 31 of the 33 Senators shots on goals."When things weren't going our way at the end of the second period, we could've packed it in there. You know it's too tough. But we battled through some tough situations," said Miller to reporters after the game."They were trying their hardest to give it to us, but their goalie decided that he didn't want to let anything by him," said defense man Joe Corvo of the Senators.The Sabres are hoping that this begins the comeback after their 3-0 deficit, a feat only achieved by three North American sports teams, the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, the 1975 New York Islanders, and the 2004 Boston Red Sox.Game 5 of the playoffs will be held at HSBC Arena in Buffalo on Saturday, returning Home Ice advantage to the Sabres.The Detroit Red Wings hockey club announced Friday that they had signed a multi-year contract with centre Pavel Datsyuk.

With the 1-0 lead and a power play oppertunity, Nicklas Lindstrom, arguably the NHL's best defenseman scored to give the Wings a 2-0 lead. Calgary's Dion Phaneuf scored early in the second, but the Flames could never generate enough offense to make up for their early mistakes.This Eastern Conference series continues in Calgary on Tuesday, April 17th, at 10:00 pm EDT, when the Flames will be looking to get back into the series with a win on home ice.The Detroit Red Wings won their 11th Stanley Cup in National Hockey League (NHL) history on Wednesday.

It was a frustrating game for the Penguins, as they were unable to convert 0 of 6 power play attempts. Colby Armstrong scored the game's first goal, assisted by  Gary Roberts and  Sergei Gonchar, to give the Penguins the early lead. After Armstrong scored, the Islanders' defense tightened, and would not give up another goal.  Trent Hunter scored a goal on an Islanders power play 2:37 into the 2nd period, assisted by  Miroslav Satan and  Chris Campoli. Less than three minutes later,  Jason Blake would notch his 36th of the year, beating Penguins goalie  Marc-Andre Fleury. Blake's goal was assisted by  Ryan Smith and  Tom Poti.

(Best of Seven)François Beauchemin scored on a pair of power plays and Ilya Bryzgalov made 30 saves to help the Ducks to a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference series. Games 3 and 4 are in St. Paul on Sunday and Tuesday.The Wild struggled again on the power play, going 0-for-6 after failing to convert on four power plays in the 2-1 opening loss. Then there was the Ducks' short-handed goal. Ryan Getzlaf took a pass from Travis Moen along the left boards, feinted inside against Minnesota defenseman Martin Skoula, cut outside and zipped around him. The Ducks' center then flipped the puck over Nicklas Backstrom's stick.Minnesota coach Jacques Lemaire said: "I thought we played a great game. It was just getting the power play to go a little better and staying out of the box. The rest of the game was fine."Mikko Koivu scored from the top of the crease, managing to get off the shot as he was falling down, and the puck got past Bryzgalov on the glove side. Marian Gaborik scored at 3:33 of the second period to draw the Wild even 1-1.Ducks lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)Dustin Penner scored the game winning goal with 5:20 remaining in regulation, and the Anaheim Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild 2-1, Wednesday night. The Ducks took a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven game series, thanks in part to Penner's goal. After a scoreless first period highlighted by good defensive play from both teams, Pavol Demitra scored the game's first goal in the second, beating Anaheim goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov to give Minnesota a 1-0 lead. 3:51 later, Teemu Selanne scored on a breakaway, knotting the score up at 1-1. With the score tied in the third, the Ducks picked up a rebound off a shot by the Wild. Quickly, the Ducks mounted a counter-attack, passing the puck up to Penner. Penner shot from the left side of the net, but the puck was stopped by Minnesota goaltender Nicklas Backstrom. However, the puck would richochet off of the pad of Backstrom, allowing Penner to shove the puck into the net, sealing the Ducks win. Commenting on his score after the game in the post game press conference, Penner said: "If the puck didn't go in after the initial shot I wanted to be able to pick up any loose change." And that was exactly what he did.Ducks lead series 3-0. (Best of Seven)The Minnesota Wild fell to the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday, putting their season in jeopardy. Anaheim needs only one win in any of the final four games to win the series and the right to move on to the Western Conference Semifinals. The Wild have been close in every game of the series, but have fell short each time.Minnesota coach Jacques Lemaire said: "Everyone was saying, 'Shoot the puck! Shoot the puck!' on the bench and then they went back on the ice and they didn't shoot it," coach Jacques Lemaire said. "The guys recognized the mistakes we were making and couldn't adjust." Andy McDonald gave the Ducks the lead in the first, scoring on the power play to give the Ducks the early advantage. Ilya Bryzgalov would help the Ducks' cause, stopping 19 of 20 shots faced. Rob Niedermayer got his first goal of the postseason in the third period to double the Ducks' lead. Petteri Nummelin scored the only goal for the Wild with :39 remaining in regulation, which wouldn't be enough time to mount a comeback.Sunday's loss beckoned in do or die time for the Wild, who must win Tuesday, when Minnesota will host the Anaheim Ducks. If the Wild cannot pick up a win in Tuesday's game, the series will be lost, as well as Minnesota's season.Detroit leads series 2-1. (Best of Seven)Two power play goals helped lead the Calgary Flames to a 3-2 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on Tuesday.

Kris Draper then evened the scoring only two minutes later, with the only assist being credited to Daniel Cleary.Draper was again on the scoresheet at the beginning of the third, with Cleary again assisting, as he put the Red Wings into the lead.  An interference penalty to Matthew Schneider of the Red Wings then gave the Flames a power play, and Mark Giordano capitalized as his unassisted marker tied the game at two a piece. Jarome Iginla then scored the winning goal for the Flames at 9:21 of the third, with assists going to Wayne Primeau and Tony Amonte.Ottawa Senators winger Dany Heatley notched his 50th goal of the season in the Senators 6-3 win over the Boston Bruins Saturday night.It was the second consecutive 50-goal season for the talented winger.

The Bruins ended the season losing 11 of their last 12 games.The Devils came into Wednesday night's game trailing the Buffalo Sabres by five points in the Eastern Conference, and with the Pittsburgh Penguins hot on their trail.

Neither happened, however, as the Sabres defeated the Devils before 18,690 at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York.Just 1:55 into the first period, Jochen Hecht scored his first of two goals, his 18th of the season, assisted by Jason Pominville and Dmitri Kalinin, who would pick up two assists in the game.

In the second period, Buffalo would make it 2-1 at 7:25, when Daniel Paille, assisted by Adam Mair and Teppo Numminen scored. The Sabres scored again at 11:47, when Jochen Hecht would tally his second goal of the game from a pass by Daniel Briere. Dmitri Kalinin was also credited with an assist on the goal. Trailing 3-1, New Jersey came back with their own goal at 13:49, when Paul Martin picked up his third goal of the season, narrowing the deficit to one goal.

Dainius Zubrus, along with Chris Drury, would be given credit for assisting the play. With two seconds remaining in the game, the Devils Zach Parise scored, but it was too late, as the Sabres would hold on for the win.Martin Brodeur saved 19 of 23 shots faced. Ryan Miller, the 3rd star of the game, stopped 28 of 31 shots faced, accumulating a .903 save percentage in the game.Philadelphia at New JerseyFri Mar 30, 2007, 7:30 pm EDTNY Islanders at BuffaloFri Mar 30, 2007, 8:00 pm EDTSeries tied at 1-1. (Best of Seven)After trashing the New York Islanders just two days before, the Buffalo Sabres may have thought this series was in the bag. Maybe they were already looking ahead to the Conference Semifinals. Whatever the case, Buffalo wasn't entirely in the game tonight, and the Islanders capitalized on it. Rick DiPietro, out last night from injury, returned to play a spectacular game against the Sabres. DiPietro stopped 32 of 34 shots faced, compiling a .941 save percentage. In the post-game press conference, DiPietro stated that he "could've used a little WD-40 on the joints here and there". DiPietro was just fine without any WD-40, picking up his first win in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs.New York took a 2-0 lead and never looked back, even though Buffalo would manage to tie the game for around 6:00 toward the end of the game. The tie was broken midway through the third period, when Marc-Andre Bergeron buried the puck behind Sabres goaltender Ryan Miller.The Eastern Conference series between the Islanders and Sabres, which is currently tied up at 1-1, will continue on Monday, Apr 16, at 7:30 pm EDT in New York.Devils lead series 1-0.

Martin Brodeur was solid as always in net for the Devils, notching 23 saves to pick up the win.Tampa and Jersey will face each other at least three more times in the Opening Round of the NHL Playoffs. The next meeting between the two clubs will be Saturday at 7:00 pm EDT, when the teams will meet again at Continental Airlines Arena.Tampa Bay leads series 2-1. (Best of Seven)After losing the playoff opener, the Tampa Bay Lightning have won two straight, to take the series lead, two games to one. Both teams did very well both on the attack and in their own zone at the  St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida Monday night. Vincent Lecavalier would be the first to score midway through the first period, on a sharp angle to put the Lightning up 1-0. Johan Holmqvist would shutout the Devils though the entire first period but Martin Brodeur would return the favor as he would shutout the Lightning throughout the second period. The Devils did rebound from the 1-0 score as John Madden would score in the dying seconds of the second period to make the game 1-1. In the third period, as it was tied 1-1, Brad Richards would score very early on and put the Lightning up, yet again, at 2-1. Shortly after the Brad Richards goal, the Devils would counter with a goal of their own as Zach Parise scored to tie the game once more at 2-2. In the end Tampa Bay would be victorious as Vaclav Prospal scored the game winner late in the third. Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur needs to play better if he wants his team to advance, as he has given up a unusually high three goals in all three games of the series. The next game in the series is scheduled for Wednesday, April 18th, at 7:00 PM EST in Tampa Bay.The Montreal Canadiens, the oldest and most successful National Hockey League team, played their 100th home opener against Original Six rivals the Boston Bruins on the night of October 15, 2008.  The Canadiens won the game in a shootout, 4-3.Senators lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)The young Pittsburgh Penguins were given their first taste of the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs, Wednesday night. Needless to say, they didn't enjoy it. The Ottawa Senators defeated the Penguins 6-3 to take a one game advantage in the best of seven series. The game went from bad to downright nasty, with 20 penalties between the two clubs throughout the game, keeping the officiating crew busy throughout the game.The experienced Senators exploded out of the gates, taking an early lead just 1:37 into regulation, when Andrej Meszaros scored the first goal of the series. Chris Kelly would score 5:01 later to double the Sens' lead to two goals. In the second period, Tom Preissing would give Ottawa a 3-0 advantage at 14:38. The Penguins would finally get on the scoresheet 2:20 later, when rookie Jordan Staal scored his first career playoff goal, to make it a two goal game. Dany Heatley scored the Senators' second power play goal of the night, just 0:09 into the final period, beating Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, who was under siege for most of the night. Ottawa wouldn't let up, scoring two more goals before Sergei Gonchar found the back of the net. Sidney Crosby would tally his first career playoff goal with :49 left in the game, burying the puck behind Ottawa goaltender Ray Emery.Crosby appeared to have scored earlier in the third period to narrow the score to two goals, when both Crosby and the puck plowed into the net, but the ruling was overturned, leaving Crosby and the Penguins bench shaking their heads in disgust. In the post game press conference, Crosby said that he would have to see the replay before ruling for himself if he had scored or not.Fights erupted several times throughout the game, and the penalties mounted for each team as the tension grew. The teams entered the game with a mutual dislike for each other, and no doubt left loathing each other. Perhaps the most exciting outcome of the game is the anticipation for the next game of the series. The Penguins and Senators face each other again, Saturday afternoon, in the best of seven series.After scoring to tie the game on home ice in the third period, the Buffalo Sabres were defeated, Saturday afternoon, at the 9:32 mark in overtime on a goal by Ottawa Senators Captain Daniel Alfredsson.The win by the Senators knocked the Sabres out of the Stanley Cup race and sent the Senators to the finals for the first time in modern franchise history. The Senators are now a total of 12 and 3 in the three series so far, with only one loss per series. They now await the outcome of the Anaheim Ducks and Detroit Red Wings series to see who they will play in the finals. On Sunday, the Ducks pulled ahead 3 games to 2 on the Red Wings with their overtime win on an unassisted Teemu Selanne goal at 11:57 into the first overtime period.Alfredsson now has ten goals in the playoffs, and is in good standing for consideration as playoff MVP. The Senators first line dominated the game after being shut out in the previous game. Dany Heatley and Jason Spezza both scored on Saturday. Spezza also had one assist, while Heatley managed two assists, one of which came on the game-winning goal. Ray Emery made 27 saves in the win for Ottawa. "What else can you say about Alfie?" said Spezza. "He's been our leader the whole time. It's only fitting he scores that winner."Jochen Hecht and Maxim Afinogenov scored for the Sabres, while Ryan Miller made 22 saves. It was the third loss in the series for the Sabres at HSBC Arena, who were unable to capitalize on their home-ice advantage."We had a lot to be proud of," said Lindy Ruff, the Sabres head coach. "It's disappointing. It's painful. You've got to grow, you've got to stick with the program. It was a fun year. It was hard to lose those two overtime games here in our building."The Pittsburgh Penguins future in Pittsburgh is skating on thin ice after owners Ron Burke and Mario Lemieux sent a letter Wednesday addressed to Pennsylvania Governer Ed Rendell, Alleghney County Executive Officer Dan Onorato, and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, stating that the organization was prepared to "aggressively explore relocation", after reaching what the organization called an "impasse." This threat came just three days after Rendell expressed his belief that a new arena deal was close. Lemieux and Burke visited Kansas City on January 4, 2007 to explore possibly moving the team if a new arena deal in Pittsburgh could not be reached. The offer from Kansas City includes free rent of the $276 million Sprint Center, which is still under construction. The Penguins would be asked to pay $2.86 million per year to rent a proposed arena in Pittsburgh, better than the orignial offer of $4 million a year, including $1.16 million each year in naming rights, along with an upfront contribution of $8.5 million.The  Pittsburgh Penguins beat the Boston Bruins 5-0 on Sunday at  Mellon Arena.  Sidney Crosby led the Penguins with 2 goals and an assist, pushing his point total to 111 on the season.  Evgeni Malkin,  Gary Roberts, and  Ryan Malone also scored for the Penguins. The Penguins were strong on special teams, scoring 3 power play goals and 1 shorthanded goal, while also killing five Bruins penalties.  Marc-Andre Fleury saved all 29 shots he faced.  It was his 5th shutout this season and 7th of his career.The Penguins moved into a tie with the  New Jersey Devils with the win. The Penguins had tied them yesterday afternoon, but New Jersey's win that night put them ahead by 2 points once more. New Jersey holds the tiebreaker, with 44 wins against the Penguins' 43.  They also sit 2 points behind the  Ottawa Senators for 4th place in the East.Meanwhile, Boston has lost the last 4 games and 7 of the past 9. They are virtually eliminated from the playoffs, sitting 13th in the Eastern Conference with 74 points. With 8 games remaining, they sit 10 points out of the playoffs.The Penguins return to the ice Tuesday when they will travel to Washington to face the  Capitals. The Bruins also play Tuesday, when they visit  Ottawa.The  Pittsburgh Penguins secured a spot in the  2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs when they defeated the  Washington Capitals Thursday night, before 18,227 at the Verizon Center.The Capitals got off to a fast start, after Washington's  Alexander Semin took a pass from  Alexander Ovechkin, and backhanded it past Pittsburgh goalie  Marc-Andre Fleury at 5:59 in the first period. Less than five minutes later,  Boyd Gordon would double the Capitals lead, scoring his 6th goal of the season.  Michel Ouellet took advantage of a Penguins power play at 12:08, sending an  Erik Christinsen pass past  Olaf Kolzig to narrow the Capitals lead to one goal. Pittsburgh dominated the second period, with  Sidney Crosby picking up his 35th goal in between two goals by  Ryan Whitney. In a last minute desprate attempt at a comeback,  Milan Jurcina scored to make it 4-3. Unfortunatley for the Capitals, Jurcina's goal came with only 32 seconds remaining in regulation. Washington was unable to score again, lifting the Penguins to victory, and securing their berth into the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs.Washington has dropped 13 of their last 15 games while the Penguins have won 3 strait. The Caps return to the ice Friday, when they will travel to Miami to battle the  Panthers. The Pens will travel to Boston to take on the  Bruins, Thursday. The Penguins defeated Boston 5-0 Sunday afternoon in Pittsburgh.The Pittsburgh Penguins won an exciting game Friday in Miami, as they defeated the Florida Panthers.The Penguins, just off of a 16 game winning streak after dropping one to the New York Islanders on Monday, had some goalie controversy as to who will start the game. Penguins coach Michel Therrien had said that he was unhappy with the play of goalie Marc-Andre Fleury against the Islanders. As a result of this, goalie Jocelyn Thibault got the nod to start for the Pens on Thursday. There was also a goalie problem for the Panthers, as Alex Auld (Panthers starting goalie) had suffered an injury in a previous game and was out for the night. Instead, they started the old veteran Ed Belfour, who did a good job, stoping the puck 39 of the 41 shots he faced, which is a solid outing for any goalie. But it would be Jocelyn Thibault who outdid him, stopping 32 of 33 shots on goal.Goal scoring was rather low, though, with Jordan Staal (Powerplay) and Colby Armstrong (Game winner, Overtime) scoring for the Penguins and Juraj Kolník scoring for the Panthers. Assists were credited to Evgeni Malkin, Sidney Crosby, Maxime Talbot, and Ryan Whitney for the Pens and Chris Gratton and Bryan Allen for the Panthers. The Three Stars of the game were given to Colby Armstrong (First Star), Jocelyn Thibault (Second Star),and Ed Belfour (Third Star).All in all, this game was well played and was a solid win for the streaking Penguins. Pittsburgh will travel across the state to face the surging Tampa Bay Lightning this Sunday.The Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Ottawa Senators in the closing seconds of Thursday night's game, pulling the Penguins into a tie with the Senators for points, with 103 each. With New Jersey clinching the Atlantic Division title after defeating Philadelphia, Pittsburgh locks into a first round matchup with Ottawa in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, though who will claim home ice advantage is still unknown. Pittsburgh can still claim home ice advantage if Ottawa loses their season finale Saturday in Boston.Jason Spezza struck first in the game, scoring a power play goal at 7:59. Ray Emery would hold the Penguins scoreless until 14:05 in the first, when Michel Ouellet scored a power play goal to even the score at 1-1. Gary Roberts gave the Penguins the lead 55 seconds later, scoring the third power play goal of the game, and Roberts' 19th of the season to give the Pens the edge, 2-1 heading into the second period. Dany Heatley would make it four power play goals in the game, when he scored his NHL best 49th goal of the season, assisted by Jason Spezza and Mike Comrie, to tie the game at two goals apiece. Both teams would tighten up on defense, holding each other scoreless until the final period, when Maxime Talbot would give the Penguins the 3-2 lead and the victory, with 9.8 seconds remaining in the game, stunning the 24,064 in attendance at Scotiabank Place in Ottawa.Marc-Andre Fleury picked up the win, stopping 35 of the 37 shots he faced. Ray Emery was saddled with the loss, stopping 24 of 27 shots faced.The Senators will try to claim home ice advantage Saturday, when the Boston Bruins host Ottawa. Game time is scheduled for 7:00.

Sidney Crosby scored the game-winning goal midway through the third period, when he redirected a pass from teammate Mark Recchi into the net behind Ottawa goaltender Ray Emery. The Senators weren't pleased with the goaltending of Ray Emery, who despite only facing 21 shots, allowed four goals. Penguins netminder Marc-Andre Fleury, however, was spectacular at times, denying 34 of 37 Senators' shots, including a game-saving stop of Mike Fisher from the slot with 13.3 seconds remaining in regulation.  The Penguins acquired Gary Roberts from the Florida Panthers for playoff experience, and that is what he gave the team today, scoring the game-tying goal in the third, and adding an assist. The Penguins and Senators are now tied in the best-of-seven series, with one game apiece.Ryan Whitney gave the Pens the early lead when he scored his first goal of the postseason at 3:01, during a power play opportunity. Ottawa would rally to take a 2-1 lead in the second, with Jason Spezza and captain Daniel Alfredsson each receiving credit for goals. Pittsburgh would storm back to tie the game in the third, when Gary Roberts picked up his first postseason goal with the Penguins at 2:04. Ottawa would answer with a goal to retain the lead one last time. The Penguins rookie phenom Jordan Staal scored his second goal in as many games at 9:34. With the game tied at three goals apiece, Sidney Crosby, the youngest Art Ross trophy winner in NHL history would step up. Evgeni Malkin passed the puck to Mark Recchi, who would in turn move the puck up to Crosby where he would bury it behind the Senators' Ray Emery.After chasing the New Jersey Devils the entire season, the Pittsburgh Penguins have finally caught up. With only 15 games remaining between the two clubs, the Penguins have arrived at 94 points, to pull into a virtual tie with New Jersey. New Jersey holds the tiebreaker, with 43 wins against the Penguins' 42. The two points that the Penguins received today wouldn't prove to be easy, though, as they would have to defeat the Southeast division leading Atlanta Thrashers.Michel Ouellet, assisted by Gary Roberts and Evgeni Malkin, gave the Penguins a 1-0 lead at 7:55 when he beat Thrashers goalie Kari Lehtonen to score his 17th goal of the season. Jocelyn Thibault would hold Atlanta scoreless through the first two periods until Scott Mellanby finally broke through to score at 6:18 into the final period. With the score tied 1-1, Jordan Staal would score what would prove to be the game winner on a fluke shot from behind the goal line at 10:19. Assists were credited to Ryan Malone and Josef Melichar. Despite desperate play and a pulled goalie in the final minutes, Atlanta couldn't find the net, and the Penguins would hold on for the win. Thibault was spectacular for the Penguins, stopping 25 of 26 shots. Thrashers goaltender Kari Lethonen was almost as good as Thibault, stopping 26 of 28 shots faced.The Penguins return to the ice tommrow when they will host the Boston Bruins at Mellon Arena. Atlanta does not play again until Wednesday, when they will travel to Florida to take on the Panthers.The Pittsburgh Penguins, after three shootout victories from Sidney Crosby, were finally dealt a loss, Thursday night. The Penguins had a hard time against the Devils as, once again, the Devils brought their best and the Penguins simply fell short. In the first period, the Penguins took a 1-0 lead off an Evgeni Malkin Power Play goal, with Mark Recchi and Sidney Crosby assisting. It wasn't until the second period that the Devils really turned up the heat, scoring two unanswered goals by Andy Greene on the power play, his first in the NHL, and Sergei Brylin's goal, with Patrik Elias, Brian Rafalski, John Oduya and Scott Gomez assisting. In the final period, the Penguins rallied back to tie the game after Sergei Gonchar scored a goal on the power play, with Jordan Staal picking up the assist. But Marc-Andre Fleury let another puck past, and the Devils took the lead. Late in the third, on a great individual play, Evgeni Malkin picked off the puck in the Devils zone and set up Michel Ouellet for a beautiful goal to tie the game once again and send it in to overtime. After a stalemate in the overtime period, Patrik Elias (the only shooter to score) would win the game for Devils in a hard fought game. The Penguins managed to pick up a point against the Atlantic Division leading Devils. Both teams will have Friday off before the Penguins battle the Rangers and the Devils face the Sabres on Saturday.The Ottawa Senators thought that the game was over. Coming into the third period, the Senators led the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-1, dominating every aspect of the game. After only one goal by Colby Armstrong, Ray Emery would blank the Penguins for the next 45 minutes the game. Things spiraled out of control when Marc-Andre Fleury allowed Mike Fischer, Christoph Schubert, and Chris Kelly to score in under  10 minutes, stopping only 4 out of the 7 shots he faced, and was pulled before the end of the first in favor of backup goaltender Jocelyn Thibault. Thibault's only mistake of the game came at 4:32 in the second period, when the Senators' Dany Heatley scored a power play goal to make it a 3 score game. After Heatley's goal, the offensive show the Senators had been putting on suddenly vanished. Backed by Thibault's strong play in net, Penguins rookie Jordan Staal scored his NHL best 7th shorthanded goal to make it 4-2. Still down by multiple goals, recent acquisition Gary Roberts scored at 11:02, to narrow the margin to 1 goal. 1 minute and 8 seconds later, Ryan Malone tied it up for his 14th goal of the season.After a scoreless overtime period, Pittsburgh's Eric Christinsen and Ottawa's Dean McAmmond both scored to even the shootout at one goal apiece. Sidney Crosby, who won Sunday's game in Philadelphia in a shootout, would get the chance to win it for the Penguins. Crosby took the puck and beat Emery on the right side to lift the Penguins to the overtime victory, 5-4.The Pittsburgh Penguins need points, but not as bad as the Toronto Maple Leafs. It was evident, Saturday, as the Maple Leafs held on to defeat the Penguins 5-4 in overtime. Toronto threw away a four goal advantage, as the Penguins managed to pick up a precious point in the quest for home-ice advantage in the playoffs. Every game is crucial for Toronto, as they currently sit in ninth spot in the east, one point back of Montreal for the final playoff spot.It didn't take long for Toronto to take over the game, scoring 4:28 into the first period. Chad Kilger beat starting goaltender Jocelyn Thibault for his 14th goal of the season. Kyle Wellwood and Darcy Tucker assisted Kilger on the goal. Gary Roberts, the product of one of Pittsburgh's deadline trades anwsered just over two minutes later to tie the match. Sergei Gonchar, one of the NHL's highest scoring defenders picked up an assist along with Rookie of the Year contender Evgeni Malkin. Toronto would strike back at 18:30, when Alexei Ponikarovsky scored his 20th goal of the season, assisted by Nik Antropov and Mats Sundin. The Maple Leafs kept piling on goals, with Tomas Kaberle and Bryan McCabe each scoring to make it 4-1. The goals caused Pens coach Michael Therrien to pull goaltender Jocelyn Thibault in favor of Mark Andre Fleury. Pittsburgh's Max Talbot scored at 16:31 to end the second period at 4-2. Pittsburgh climbed back into the game with less than five minutes remaining, when Sidney Crosby, assisted by Ryan Whitney and Evgeni Malkin, scored his team-high 36th goal of the season. Trailing by one goal, Ryan Whitney stepped up for the Penguins, firing a pass from Sergei Gonchar beyond Leafs goalie Andrew Raycroft with four seconds remaining in regulation. The stunned fans inside the AirCanada Center got their money's worth, however, as Toronto's Tomas Kaberle, the eventual 1st star of the game would score in overtime to give the Maple Leafs the win and the critical extra point.Pennsylvania governor  Ed Rendell announced Tuesday morning that a deal had been struck between state and local officials and the  Pittsburgh Penguins hockey franchise. The Penguins organization will formally announce the deal tonight, prior to the Penguins game against the  Buffalo Sabres at the  Mellon Arena. The deal will ensure that the Penguins will remain in the city with a 30 year lease on a new arena to be built in downtown  Pittsburgh. The framework of the deal was constructed in an emergency meeting last Thursday in  Philadelphia, when both government and franchise officials indicated that progress had been made, with the details laid out over the weekend. With the new deal, the Penguins organization would be expected to pay $3.8 million per year, as well as $7.5 million per year from both  Don Barden, owner of  Majestic Star Casino, and the state economic development fund. The Penguins organization has also been given the option of building a parking garage on property of the  Pittsburgh Sports Authority between Centre and Fifth avenues, by contributing $500,000 per year.The new arena is expected to cost approximately $290 million, and should be completed and ready to host hockey games by 2009. The Penguins will sign a temporary lease to keep the team at Mellon Arena until the new building is finished.Pittsburgh denied the Detroit Red Wings a Stanley Cup on Monday as it won 4-3 in overtime on Monday's Game 5 of North America's premiere ice hockey championship.NY Rangers lead series 3-0. (Best of Seven)The  New York Rangers annihilated the  Atlanta Thrashers Monday night, burying pucks in the back of the goal the entire game with  Michael Nylander leading the way. Nylander scored the first  hat trick of the postseason, scoring the opening goal, as well as the final, as the  Rangers to a dominated the  Atlanta Thrashers, 7-0. Nylander scored his first of what would be three goals 0:32 into regulation, beating  Kari Lehtonen, who was just barraged with pucks the entire night. Nylander's first goal would prove to be the game winner, but the  Rangers were determined to pad their lead.  Nylander scored his second of the game 9:13 later to double the  Rangers lead. After four more scores,  Nylander would cap the game off at 15:54 to complete the  Thrashers' embarrassing loss.The  Atlanta Thrashers, down three games, will try to stop their skid, and the sweep of the opening round series Wednesday night, when they will travel to  Madison Square Garden in  New York City to battle the  Rangers, perhaps for the last time.Rangers lead series 2-0. (Best of Seven)The Thrashers' Johan Hedberg and the Rangers' Henrik Lundqvist put on goaltending clinics Saturday night, but it would be Lundqvist that had the last laugh as the Atlanta Thrashers fell to the New York Rangers 2-1 before 18,803 at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. Hedberg would win the first star of the game, earning a .949 save percentage, but Lundqvist would win the game, holding Atlanta to just one goal, while stopping 27 of 28 shots. The Thrashers, playing in just their second postseason contest in club history, dating back to 1997, are under pressure to win after going down in the series by two games.New York's Sean Avery scored the only goal of the first two periods at 8:08 in the first. The scoresheet would remain blank until the third period, when at 5:35, Illya Kovalchuk scored Atlanta's only goal of the contest to tie the score, 1-1. The score would remain tied until 15:59, when New York's Brendan Shanahan beat Hedberg for the game winning goal.Sidney Crosby became the youngest player in NHL history to score 100 points in two consecutive seasons, and the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in front of 17,132 at Mellon Arena in Pittsburgh, Saturday. The Rangers did manage, however, to pick up a precious point, as they managed to send the game into overtime.The only goal of the first period was scored by the Rangers' Karel Rachunek, his 6th of the season at 19:14. The goal was assisted by Michael Nylander and Petr Prucha. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist stopped all 7 shots faced in the first.In the second period, Lundqvist continued where he had left off in the first, stopping another 7 shots, and blanking the Penguins for a second consecutive period. Just 1:11 into the period,  Matt Cullen scored his 13th of the season to increase the Rangers' lead to 2-0. Cullen's goal was assisted by Jed Ortmeyer.The third period over the past several games had been where the Penguins had amassed most of their offence. This game would prove no different, as rookie Evgeni Malkin scored a power play goal at 3:32, his team leading 31st of the season. Malkin was assisted by  Ryan Whitney and Sergei Gonchar. Gonchar would pick up his second assist of the game less than 4:00 later, when on another Penguins power play, he and Malkin would set up Sidney Crosby for his record-setting goal to tie the game at 2-2. With the score locked up at the end of regulation, the game would go into overtime.The Penguins, quite familiar with overtime, would end the game just 1:19 into overtime. With Sidney Crosby in the locker room due to an equipment problem,  Colby Armstrong scored against Lundqvist to lift the Penguins to victory. It was not a total loss for the Rangers, however, as they managed to pick up a point in the contest.  The Penguins don't play again until Tuesday night, when the Buffalo Sabres travel to Mellon Arena. The Rangers return to the ice tomorrow at home against the Carolina Hurricanes.Rangers lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)The New York Rangers scored the first two goals and never looked back, defeating the Thrashers before 18,857 at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. The game was the first in the best-of-seven series. Never since their inception into the NHL in 1997, have the Thrashers advanced to the playoffs until this season, and will have to wait for their first ever playoff victory. Despite a desperate last minute power play, Atlanta couldn't manage to beat Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, who has shined this season. Lundqvist was solid again tonight, stopping 21 of 24 shots faced. Pascal Dupuis of the Atlanta Thrashers was sent into the boards in the first period, and had to come off the ice for some time before returning to score the game's final goal. Kari Lehtonen, goaltender for the Thrashers entered the game with a 2.79 goals-against average. Lehtonen allowed four goals, while stopping 34 shots.The Red Wings beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-1 today withTomas Holmstroms scoring twice to move into first place in the NHL.Brett Lebda had a goal and an assist while Pavel Datsyuk also scored on the slapshot for Detroit. There were a game-breaking 3 goals in the second period.The Red Wings have a 3-0-3 record for the last three games, for a total of 108 points, surpassing The Buffalo Sabres in the race to be the team with the most regular season points to win the President's Trophy.The Red Wings have won five straight Central Division titles, and increased their division lead to three points over Nashville for this season. There are three games remaining for both teams.Rick Nash with a wraparound for the Blue Jackets with just 59 seconds left, Nash's 25th goal this season. This ended goaltender Dominik Hasek's bid for his 76th career shutout. The Blue Jackets had 32 shots.Columbus has lost three games straight. This is just after a 4-game winning streak.Buffalo leads series 2-1. (Best of Seven)The Buffalo Sabres defeated the New York Islanders Monday night to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series in the opening round of the NHL Playoffs. Despite being rattled by a puck to the face mask in the first, Buffalo goaltender Ryan Miller put up respectable numbers, saving 20 of 22 shots faced. After a scoreless first period, Adam Mair, at 5:17, scored the first goal for the Sabres, taking a cross-ice pass from Chris Drury, beating Islanders goaltender Rick DiPietro on the stick side. Thomas Vanek would double the Sabres' lead, pushing the puck past DiPietro's glove side that was initially ruled no good, before being reviewed Trent Hunter would answer for the Islanders less than a minute and a half later, picking up a rebound off of Ryan Smyth's shot. Just over three minutes later, at 12:56 in the second period, with the Sabres on the power play, Daniel Briere would lead the shot barrage, finally beating DiPietro to score his first goal of the postseason. With eight seconds remaining in the second, Randy Robitaille would fake a shot from the left side before moving behind the cage, passing the puck to Ryan Smyth, who was parked in front of Buffalo netminder Ryan Miller. Smyth would score to narrow the Sabres' lead to one. However, the Sabres seized and kept control of the third period, outshooting the Islanders 17-2 over the final 20 minutes while protecting their one-goal lead. Despite losing the game, the Islanders are still very much alive in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. They will try to knot the series up at two games apiece on Wednesday, when New York will host the Buffalo Sabres once again.Joe Thornton had a goal and an assist, Evgeni Nabokov made 15 saves and the Sharks beat Vancouver 5-2 for their sixth victory in seven games, using their speed on two early goals and capitalizing on the Canucks' mistakes for the final two tallies.Milan Michalek, Patrick Marleau and Joe Pavelski scored for the Sharks, who won consecutive home games for just the second time all season to stay in a first-place tie with Dallas in the Pacific Division, passing Vancouver for second place in the conference standings.Despite a strong road record, San Jose won just five of its first 13 games at home, among the league's worst marks. Those woes appear to be fading, with the Sharks getting at least one point from six of their last eight games at the Shark Tank.The Anaheim Ducks closed out their series with a win over the Detroit Red Wings Tuesday night, taking the Western Conference finals in six games. The Ducks will meet the Ottawa Senators in the Stanley Cup finals. The schedule for the series was released by the league on Wednesday.The Senators will visit the Ducks at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California for Game 1 on Monday, May 28 with an 8:00 p.m. EDST (00:00 UTC) start time.The upcoming series between the Ducks and Senators cannot be compared to any recent history between the two teams. They didn't meet at all during this year's regular season and met only once since the 2004-2005 lock-out and twice since 2002-2003.When asked for his thoughts on the Ducks, Senators Captain Daniel Alfredsson didn't have much experience to go on. "I haven't seen them much," said Alfredsson. "I've seen them here and there in the playoffs. I think it will be the most physical series we've played in the playoffs so far. They're a bigger team and they've got some skill guys as well."When asked for an opinion on the Senators, two of the Ducks players weren't much more expressive. "I haven't thought a second about them," said Ryan Getzlaf of the Ducks. "I haven't been watching their games," suggested Teemu Selanne, right-winger for the Ducks.The Ducks win over the Red Wings indirectly provided some good fortune to the Edmonton Oilers hockey club. Due to a clause in the trade contract that saw the Oilers send Chris Pronger to the Ducks last year, the Oilers were to receive the Ducks first-round draft pick in 2008, if the Ducks made it into the finals.All games in the finals will have a 8:00 p.m. start time.Senators lead series 2-1. (Best of Seven)The Ottawa Senators defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, Sunday evening, to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Easter Conference Series. The Senators kept finding holes around Pittsburgh goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, scoring four times on 25 shots. Sidney Crosby became the first player to score in their first three NHL postseason games since 2001, but it wasn't enough to lift the Penguins to victory.Gary Roberts, who scored in Saturday afternoon's game, got the Penguins off to an early lead, scoring just 52 seconds into regulation. That lead wouldn't hold up, however, as Dean McAmmond would knot it up at 18:04, when he would bury the puck behind Fleury. The Penguins struggled in the second period, as they have often as of late, allowing three more goals in the period. The Penguins offense kicked in in the third period, as Sidney Crosby would add a spectacular diving goal late in the game, but the Senators managed to weather the storm to emerge victorious.The Penguins, despite being down in the series, will try to tie the series Tuesday night, when Mellon Arena will play host to the Ottawa Senators for game four of the best-of-seven series.Ottawa leads series 3-1. (Best of Seven)The Pittsburgh Penguins fell to the Ottawa Senators in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs at Mellon Arena, Tuesday night. This was not an elimination game, but surely a must win game for the Pens and they simply fell short. In the first period the Penguins were down early as an odd hanging puck found its way down into the net to put the Pens down 1-0. Jordan Staal, sacrificing his body in a block, knocked the puck through the air and into the net above Fleury's helmet. Though it looked like Chris Neil had slapped it down and in, the goal was credited to Jason Spezza, who had shot the puck into Staal. After review, it was clear that Neil had not touched the puck on it's way down. In the second period, the Pens rebounded with a goal of their own as Jordan Staal scored while tied up in a pile around the goal to tie the game 1-1. Midway through the third Anton Volchenkov scored the game winner to put the Sens up 2-1 in the game and 3-1 in the series. Both clubs played a strong game, making for an exciting atmosphere for the 17,132 in the arena. However, the problem for the Pens, as it has been through the playoffs, is the lack of shots on goal. Ray Emery faced only 11 shots in both the first and third period combined, yet in just the second period he faced 13 shots and the Penguins scored. Pittsburgh's only chance to come back in the series is to increase the number of shots on goal. All the Senators need do is win one more game and the series is theirs. The next game for these two clubs will be Thursday, April 19 at seven p.m. in Ottawa. The Penguinss must win this game in order to evade elimination.Sharks lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)Detroit leads series 3-2. (Best of Seven)Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg each scored a goal and set up two others Saturday, leading the Detroit Red Wings past the San Jose Sharks 4-1 and within one victory of reaching the Western Conference finals.Detroit is ahead 3-2 and can close this conference semifinal Monday night in San Jose.The Red Wings outhit and outshot the Sharks in Game 5, but they also had some luck.Datsyuk turned San Jose goalie Evgeni Nabokov's misplay into the winning goal late in the second period, and Nabokov didn't seem the same after that, surrendering a pair of third-period power-play goals.With the Sharks circling in the Red Wings zone, Detroit cleared the puck into San Jose territory. Nabokov left the goal to play the puck, but sent it straight into a charging Datsyuk. He scooped it up and sent it into an open net with 3:47 to play in the second.Detroit, the top seed in the West, twice has come back from two-goal deficits to win games in this series, but needed only to erase a one-goal San Jose lead Saturday.Unfortunately for the Sharks, blowing leads is becoming something of a habit. A year ago, they lost a 2-0 series lead over Edmonton in the conference semifinals.San Jose leads series 1-0 (Best of Seven)The San Jose Sharks silenced the fans at Joe Louis Arena while stunning the Detroit Red Wings with goals 24 seconds apart.Matt Carle and Mike Grier scored midway through the first period and Evgeni Nabokov made 34 saves to lead San Jose to a 2-0 victory Thursday night in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals."We got the crowd right out of the game," said Joe Thornton, who had an assist on the first goal. "That was huge."Nabokov's shutout was his first this postseason and the fifth of his career in the playoffs. He was tied for second in the NHL with seven during the regular season.The stellar goaltender said it was important that the Sharks maintained their two-goal lead for the final 2 1/2 periods."I guarantee if we would've given up one goal, they would come hard and get the momentum," Nabokov said.Dominik Hasek had to make just 17 saves because the Sharks played very conservatively after taking the lead, possessing the puck on offense and blocking shots on defense."We probably could've pushed a little bit more, but we feel comfortable with 2-0 leads," Thornton said.Game 2 is Saturday in Detroit."You know they're going to certainly bounce back and throw some new wrinkles at us and have a lot more energy in the next game," San Jose coach Ron Wilson said.Entering the series, home ice was regarded as perhaps the only advantage the top-seeded Red Wings had against the fifth-seeded Sharks.San Jose quickly took that edge away.Carle's goal at 9:45 of the first period was set up by a fantastic series of passes around the perimeter, ending with Thornton's cross-crease pass from the corner."It was just bing, bang, boom and it was in the back of the net," Thornton said.The Red Wings put San Jose's powerful power play on the ice for the first goal and lost the puck in their zone to set up the second.Grier was in the right place when the puck trickled into the slot and he wheeled around and beat Hasek with a slap shot."I don't think he knew what he was doing," Hasek said. "He just shot the puck and hit the post and it went in. It was maybe a lucky goal, but if you make a turnover, bad things can happen."It was a much different start for Detroit after taking 2-0 leads midway through the first period in each of its first two games in the first round against Calgary. The Red Wings won the series in Game 6 after winning all three games at home."We would've liked to have a better start, but we made a couple of mistakes and the puck was in the net," Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said.The Sharks seemed right at home in Detroit, perhaps because they won a league-high and franchise-record 26 games on the road this season and won twice more in Nashville, including the series-winning victory in Game 5 last week.The Red Wings had three power plays in the second period -- while San Jose didn't have one -- but they took just four shots.San Jose's swarming defense had a lot to do with that, though Detroit did seem to miss Tomas Holmstrom standing in front of the crease to redirect and shield shots."We thought they had four blocked shots on our first power play when we had people in front of the net and the puck never got through," Babcock said.San Jose blocked 13 shots and took 13 shots through two periods, and finished with 18 blocked shots.Holmstrom missed the game with an eye injury and the Red Wings were also without defenseman Brett Lebda because of an ankle injury and concussion. With stitches around his left eye, Holmstrom said he hoped to play in the series, but didn't know if he would be ready for Game 2.Even at full strength, however, Detroit doesn't seem to match up well with the Sharks' combination of depth, size, speed and skill. That appeared to be the case Thursday night and during the regular season, when San Jose won three of four meetings.Today, the Pittsburgh Penguins took on the New York Rangers in Madison Square Garden, New York.Jaromir Jagr struck first for New York, with Michael Nylander following suit in the final 2:30 to give the Rangers a comfortable 2-0 lead at the end of the second period. Staal's shorthanded goal came 76 seconds into the final period, with Staal beating Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist with a soft forehand shot. Penguins winger Colby Armstrong continued the shorthanded show, scoring less than 2:00 later with a bad angle shot, which would ricochet off of Lundqvist's pad. When all momentum had seemingly crossed to the Penguins, Blair Betts fired a goal to restore New York's lead at 3-2. Sergei Gonchar tied it up again late in the 3rd, with a blistering shot on a Penguins power play to level the score at 3-3. In the shootout, not a single score occurred until NHL scoring leader Sidney Crosby took the ice. With the shootout tied 0-0, and a point on the line, Crosby beat Lundqvist, lifting Pittsburgh to victory. The game was not a total loss for the Rangers, though, as they picked up a precious point by forcing overtime.Penguins rookie Jordan Staal wasn't supposed to make the team, and once he did make it, he wasn't expected to contribute more than assisting on the penalty kill and filling in on the fourth line. Not much could be expected of an 18 year old rookie not named Sidney Crosby. That was the premise before the season started, at least. Now, heading into the stretch run toward the NHL Playoffs, Staal leads not just rookies, but the entire National Hockey League in shorthanded goals, after notching his 6th of the season, his 26th total goal.Brenden Morrow scored the game-winning goal, 9:03 into the fourth overtime, as the Dallas Stars defeated the San Jose Sharks 2-1.  The goal gave the Stars a 4-games-to-2 series win, and they advance to the Western Conference Finals, where they'll face the Detroit Red Wings.The game, which took 5 hours and 17 minutes to complete, was marked by the play of goalies Marty Turco and Evgeni Nabokov, who combined for 114 saves.In the second period, the Stars took a 1-0 lead with an Antti Miettinen goal.  However, early in the third period, Ryane Clowe tied the game at 1, with a wrist shot that soared past the outstretched glove of Stars goalie Marty Turco.As the game went into overtime, both teams fought hard for early chances.  Both Turco and Nabokov turned away great chances, including a glove save by Nabokov that appeared to pull his glove above — but not over — the goal line; while the goal light briefly went off, referee Tim Peel waved off the goal immediately.  A video review confirmed that the shot was not a goal.  The Stars outshot the Sharks 18-11 in the first OT.In the second overtime period, the Sharks outshot Dallas a staggering 11-2, but Turco continued to keep the puck out of the net.  A third OT hooking penalty against Nicklas Grossman gave the Sharks the first power play since the second period of regulation, but they were unable to even get a shot on goal, and did not capitalize on the man advantage8:14 into the fourth overtime, a tripping penalty to Brian Campbell gave the Stars a power play.  49 seconds into the power play, forward Brenden Morrow redirected a Stephane Robidas shot to the right of Nabokov, his seventh goal of the playoffs.Turco made 61 saves on 62 shots for the win.  Nabokov made 53 saves in the loss.The game is the eighth-longest playoff game in NHL history, and the third-longest in Stars history.  In 2003, the Stars were defeated by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in a five-overtime thriller.  A 2007 game saw the Stars defeated in four overtimes by the Vancouver Canucks.Dallas avoided a deciding Game 7, which would have been held in San Jose.  The Stars won the first three games of the series, but strong performances by San Jose, including a Game 5 overtime win, narrowed the series to 3-2.The Pittsburgh Penguins played at Florida for the second time in two games. The Pens did not have the same luck as they did against the Panthers as they lost 5-1. Tampa Bay played as if they were in the playoffs finishing there checks, getting to the puck and skating well all in this great win to make them a likely candidate for the Playoffs, they are ranked third in Conference and first in division. The Pens, despite losing, are still in a good position to be in the Playoffs, they are fifth in Conference and second in division. The Goal Scoring was credited to, for the Pens: Sergei Gonchar, on a Evgeni Malkin, Sidney Crosby assist. For the Lightning: Martin St. Louis, Paul Ranger, Filip Kuba, Brad Richards, and Vincent Lecavalier, all scoring for Tampa Bay. Assists going to: Brad Richards(3), Dan Boyle, Eric Perrin(2),Ruslan Fedotenko(2), and Martin St. Louis. All in All, the Tampa Bay Lightning should try to stay consistent and play like they did in this game. For the Pens, try to rebound from this loss and try to win against the New Jersey Devils Tuesday.Series equal at 1-1. (Best of Seven)The Vancouver Canucks came out flat just one game after the sixth longest game in NHL Playoff history. Marty Turco shut down the Canucks offense, stopping all 35 shots he faced, as the Dallas Stars tied the best-of-seven series. Turco picked up right where he had left off in the previous game, when he held the Canucks scoreless through four overtime periods, keeping the net empty for over 90 minutes. The Stars scored in the first 24 seconds in the game, even though they couldn't score in 78:06 of overtime in Game 1. Jeff Halpern scored his 1st goal of the postseason, beating Vancouver goaltender Roberto Luongo, who hadn't allowed a goal in nearly five periods of play. The only other goal of the game would also belong to Joel Lundqvist, who scored 45 seconds into the final period.Dallas will looks to take the series lead when they do battle again with Vancouver on Sunday, this time on the Stars' home ice. Opening face off is scheduled for 9:30 pm EDT.The Vancouver Canucks, hockey team to Vancouver, British Columbia, unveiled it's new home and away uniforms today. Keeping the trade-mark Orca, the jersey has remixed the colors as well as adding a green stripe for both the home and away uniforms. This is the 5th jersey the team has gone through since 1970 when the team was founded.The redesign has been met with some criticisms. John Carter a graphics arts instructor at a local college was quoted as calling the redesign an "utter disappointment." The design uses the same core colors in the original design, and on the back it also has their original jersey's hockey stick symbol.  The president and CEO of the Canucks, Chris Zimmerman, recognizes this saying, "Our goal when we set out was to celebrate our heritage and to design a sweater that reflects our extraordinary city and province. "We wanted to unveil a sweater that reflects our past and our future."  Zimmerman also went on to say the design represents, "who we are and the connection to the community."Canucks lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)The Vancouver Canucks came out on top after the sixth longest game in NHL Playoff history. The final goal came after a scoring opportunity that was able to find the back of the net, finally, after Dallas Stars goaltender Marty Turco kept the net empty for over 90 minutes. Henrik Sedin connected on a pass from brother, Daniel Sedin, which unleashed a celebration from the remaining crowd at General Motors Place in Vancouver.Vancouver's goalie, Roberto Luongo had a very successful performance as he stopped a total of 72 shots to keep the Canucks in the game for as long as it lasted. On the other hand, the Stars' Turco performed fairly well, fending off 48 shots, but will likely fall to criticism as he has been unable, at least in previous seasons, to continue his all star season performances with playoff success.The game was the longest ever in Vancouver Canucks' history.Vancouver looks to extend its 1-0 series lead over the Dallas Stars after the first game as they continue the series in Vancouver on Friday at 6:00pm (PDT).

There were no apparent surprises for the sports sector in Australia in this budget. The budget, available online, claims A$380 million has been spent preparing for the 2012 Olympic Games. According to Keith Lyons, the University of Canberra Director of the National Institute of Sport Studies, sport is an important part of Australian culture and the development of sport enjoys bipartisan support. The sport "budget supports infrastructure developments and reflects a renewal of Australian sport venues post Sydney [Olympics] 2000. The Active After School investment reflects a commitment to support participation and engagement in physical activity and sport."  When Tony Naar of the Australian Paralympic Committee was asked about the impact of the budget on his organisation's efforts, he said there was little to report as there were "very few previously unannounced initiatives... the overall level of program funding was in line with the final year of the current funding cycle".The budget promises to support cricket, specifically the 2015 Cricket World Cup, and soccer (football) with the 2015 Asian Cup by allocating funding for facility improvement. A$50 million will be spent on redeveloping the Sydney Cricket Ground, A$30 million on redeveloping the Adelaide Oval, and A$15 million on redeveloping the Bellerive Oval in Hobart. A partnership between the government, New South Wales Government and the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust will cover additional costs associated with the Sydney Cricket Ground with work completed by 2014.   Local sporting infrastructure will be supported in the budget with A$30 million earmarked for this, A$10 million specifically to improve Melbourne's Olympic Park Precinct, A$5 million to support football in western Sydney, and A$3 million for Football New South Wales to build a new headquarters.  The budget promises assistance to parents to defray the cost of their children's extracurricular activities including sport as part of the SchoolKid Bonus, which will replace the Education Tax Refund.  Support for school based youth sport with A$39.2 million allocated to Active After-School Communities, a program that reaches 190,000 children, which encourages them to participate in school sports. In an attempt to curb drowning deaths of young children, an initiative has been launched to improve water safety that will be run through early childhood centres.  A$19.2 million was extended to the Australian Sport Commission to run its Active After-School Communities program in 2012/2013 with similar funding for 2013/2014. 2,000 schools and 1,300 after/out of school programs will benefit from the funding.Community Street Soccer was allocated A$1.0 million for 2012/2013 and A$1.6 million for 2013/2014.  Aimed at bringing the homeless and unemployed into the community through participation in soccer, Reclink Australia will be given the funding to implement the program.A$4.8 million was allocated to the Clontarf Foundation in New South Wales to support local sport and utilised elsewhere encourage Indigenous girls to participate in sport in Western Australia, Northern Territory, Victoria and Queensland through the Sporting Chance Program.Canberra's Centenary celebrations are addressed in the Federal budget, with A$2.6 million allocated for 2011/2012, A$2.0 million allocated for 2012/2013 and A$1.0 million allocated for 2013/2014.  Some money will go towards sport as a part of these celebrations. The Federal government is investing in Glenorchy, Tasmania, budgeting A$8.7 million in the redevelopment of the King George V sports and community precinct, with the money given to the local government.  Not all of the money is earmarked for sport, with some money paying for a dedicated office for the Migrant Resource Centre.A$1,870,000 less was budgeted for the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority from what was actually spent in 2011/2012's budget.  The government expects A$5.8 million in savings in the next four years because of changes in athlete doping testing. In the 2011/2012 budget year, A$2,729,510 was spent on Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport in special appropriations.  The 2012/2013 budget earmarks A$1,117,783 for this category.  All money in the category is allocated in line with the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995.  In the Sport and Recreation Special Account out of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet appropriation budget, the cash flow and balance opened the budget year with A$920,000 and receipts totaled A$317,000. In the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport appropriation budget, the Sport and Recreation Special Account had has an opening balance of A$949,000. Estimates for receipts for 2012/2013 are A$537,000, up from A$220,000 in actual receipts in 2011/2012's budget.

He is leading a charge to encourage runners to cover the logos on shoes they wear to training and in competition because he believes that many people who see him in pictures when he wins world records think his shoes are paid for by sponsors; they are not. Paralympic athletic competitors must buy their own shoes; while Australian Paralympic competitors receive support from the government, they still must pay for things their abled-bodied counterparts would not. O'Hanlon and Reardon believe unless competitors organise as a group and act together, they will not change the sponsorship landscape for Paralympic athletes.Teammate Michelle Errichiello didn't tape over the logos on her shoes, while O'Hanlon told Wikinews that he had taped over the logos on a pair of practice sprint shoes which he wouldn't normally cover due to photographers being present at the athletics track. They intentionally choose the flesh colour of the tape to make it more noticed by spectators, highlighting their cause and raising its profile.O'Hanlon told Wikinews reporters that additional information about these sponsorship issues could be found on his website.Dolphin Oval, Sunshine Beach, Queensland — Noosa defeated Caloundra by 20 points in their A-Grade rugby union match on Australia's Sunshine Coast.

The decision reflects our concerns that the safety of North Korean players will not be guaranteed under these circumstances."Yesterday, North Korea announced head of state Kim Yong Nam is to attend ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea, for the upcoming Winter Olympics. The proposed visit would make Kim the highest-ranking North Korean official to go to the South in several years.The move comes after the two Koreas announced a unified team to play women's ice hockey in the games and the North canceled a scheduled joint ceremonial display, opting instead for a military parade on their side of the Korean Demilitarized Zone.Kim holds the title of President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, a purely ceremonial role in the legislative body of North Korea. He is to head a 22-member delegation supplementing artists, athletes, coaches, and a cheer squad of over 200. The last time a high-ranking official visited the South was the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon when army leader and Workers' Party's Central Committee member Hwang Pyong So came to the closing ceremony. Hwang was purportedly the second most powerful man in North Korea behind supreme leader Kim Jong-un until he disappeared in late 2017.South Korea's Ministry of Unification announced the delegation after the unified Korean women's ice hockey team lost to Sweden 3–1. The two nations plan to march together on February 9's opening ceremony but the North canceled a joint cultural event, instead announcing a military parade for the day before.  The allies are to hold annual joint military exercises after the Paralypmics which follow the Olympic Games.Australian A-League football (soccer) club North Queensland Fury announced the signing of former Liverpool FC striker Robbie Fowler for their debut season. Fowler will be their marquee player—meaning his wages fall outside the salary cap—as announced at a press conference held by their owner and chairman, Don Matheson. Fowler signed with the club on a two-season deal, for undisclosed terms, which will see him at the Fury until at least the end of the 2010-2011 season.North Queensland, who will start their competitive history in the 2009-10 A-League season beginning later this year, have had trouble securing a marquee player, after Brazilian Cássio withdrew from negotiations at the last minute to re-sign with Adelaide United. Jade North asked for a release from his freshly-signed North Queensland contract to pursue a future with Incheon United after only five weeks.Fowler, who was nicknamed "God" by Liverpool fans following his amazing feats for the Merseyside club—128 goals in 266 matches across two periods with the club—left English Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in December and was a free agent. He has been capped 26 times for England at senior level, most recently at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and is the fourth-highest goal-scorer in the 17-season history of the Premier League.The 33-year-old was announced as in talks with the club in mid-January, and met with Matheson and inaugural Fury manager Ian Ferguson in Townsville for an inspection before flying back to England on January 22 to discuss the move with his family. "I had nothing but good things to tell my family about the football side of things and the lifestyle opportunities North Queensland can offer us," Fowler was quoted as saying.The signing is a huge boost for the club, who will enter the A-League later this calendar year along with fellow expansion club Gold Coast United, also based in Queensland. Gold Coast, who have secured current Socceroos midfielder Jason Čulina as their marquee player, are largely viewed as the more glamorous of the two, however owner Matheson said this signing went a long way to redressing that."Robbie is a legitimate international super star of the game and there’s no doubt he will give us every chance of winning," Matheson said.North and South Korea say they are ready to unify on the athletic field. For the first time, senior sports officials say the two countries will compete as a combined team in the next Olympics.North and South Korea's top athletes will go for the gold as part of the same team during the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, and in the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar.Senior athletic officials from both countries confirmed the news on the sidelines of the ongoing East Asian games in Macau, China.North Korean team representative Kim Yeong Min says the united team will be a powerful display for the world. Mr. Kim says the unified team will show the world that North and South Korea are one nation.North and South Korean athletic teams have marched together in several past athletic opening ceremonies, but never competed as a unified team.The Korean peninsula has been divided by the world's most heavily fortified border since the communist North fought the capitalist South in a 1950–53 war. But contacts between the two Koreas have increased in a gradual warming of relations since an historic 2000 summit in Pyongyang.Sports-related cooperation is part of a broader strategy of North-South engagement supported by the South Korean government.The two Koreas are expected to work out details of the combined team in a meeting next month in the North Korean border city of Kaesong.The location has come to symbolize South Korean economic engagement with the North, because it is the home of a South Korean industrial joint venture with Pyongyang. It is also where Seoul opened its first government liaison office in North Korea last week.In the first sledge hockey game of the 2014 Winter Paralympics held earlier today at Shayba Arena at Sochi's Coastal Village Olympic Park, Norway defeated the Czech Republic 2–1 in a shootout win. Norway's Audun Bakke scored the team's only goal in regulation time during the second period.  The Czech Republic's Michal Geier scored the equalizer in the third period.

They are the only country to have this accomplishment.Norway is next scheduled to play Canada tomorrow, and then Sweden on March 11 to complete their games in group play.  The Czech Republic is scheduled to play Sweden tomorrow and conclude group play against Canada on March 11.Yesterday, Karsten Warholm of Norway won the 400 metres hurdles final at the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. This was a successful defense of his 2017 title won in London, United Kingdom. The World Athletics Championships are held every other year.Warholm, who is 23 years old, won the gold medal with a time of 47.42 seconds. The silver medal was won by Rai Benjamin from the United States, who finished the race in 47.66 seconds. Third place and the bronze medal went to Abderrahman Samba of Qatar with a time of 48.03 seconds.Speaking to BBC Sport, Warholm said, "This was a very tough race. I actually felt my heart was going to stop [...] I thought 'I'm going to die but it's going to be worth it'." He also commented on the future, "This is only the beginning and I am very lucky to win [...] It's deserved but in the future these guys will be tougher to beat. Tomorrow I have to get up and work again. That is what I love."Earlier this year, Warholm set a personal best time of 46.92 seconds in the 400 m hurdles, the second-fastest time recorded in the history of the event. The world record stands at 46.78 seconds and belongs to Kevin Young. This record has stood since 1992.When the curtains were drawn and the anthem began, confusion flickered over the faces in the large hall which welcomed the NRA (National Rifle Association) to Houston. It was the sounds of rocker Ted Nugent’s rendition of the Star Spangled Banner. People didn’t know whether to put their hands over their heart, as was customary, or start clapping. According to reports, it was hard to determine what the "Motor City Madman" was doing.That was the rowdy kick off Friday night of the convention expected to draw up to 60,000 people to the George R. Brown convention center for a weekend of guns, gun-politics, gun peripherals like scopes and carry bags, and stuffed trophy heads.NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told about 2000 listeners to "Let the enemies of freedom take notice, we in this room have beaten you…" He repeated it three times for effect.Another opening act was country singer Charlie Daniels whose rant against those on the left of the political spectrum included a characterization of them as "save the whales and kill the babies pantywaists." He then pursed his lips and did his interpretation of a pantywaist, according to the Houston Chronicle: "’If we just leave the terrorists alone, they’d leave us alone.’"Hawker, Canberra — The visiting New Zealand Junior Black Sox beat the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) boys U15 team 10-1 and 12-5 in two games last night played at the Hawker International Softball Centre.  The match was part of a training camp in advance of a tournament. New Zealand dominated the game. Auckland's Marshall Layt-Maynarf pitched for New Zealand in the second game.New Zealand has long been a power in men's softball.  When the New Zealand's junior players were asked how they won so easily when Australia has been so dominant in the past few years, they replied Australia's open men's team has been able to win based on the strength of one pitcher.  When a representative of Softball ACT was asked about this, they confirmed this but said Australia dominated because of not one pitcher, but two.  One of those pitchers, Adam Folkard, has the best pitching speed in the world in the men's game and plays for the ACT.After their games wound up, the New Zealand players watched the second match of the Australia versus New Zealand test series.  They socialized with the Australian locals but most left before the second match concluded at 22:45 AEST (11:45 UTC).  New Zealand will go to Sydney to compete in junior international challenge in Sydney this Saturday.Reports say that O.J. Simpson, a former American football player is a suspect in a robbery that took place on Thursday night at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Simpson was not immediately arrested and was later released. He was not a guest at the hotel.Las Vegas Metropolitan Police (LVMPD) began to question Simpson and at least five other people, after they were accused of breaking into a room in the hotel, with at least one of the individuals holding a gun, but its not known if the room was a guest room. Several sports memorabilia items, all previously belonging to Simpson, were reported to be stolen from the room, which was registered to sports memorabilia collector Alfred Beardsley, and reports say that when police found the items, Simpson claimed that they belonged to him. Among the items stolen is believed to be a suit that Simpson wore during his 1995 murder trial, an autographed item that had been signed by Joe Montana, and "never before released" version of Simpson's book If I Did It. Simpson was found not guilty of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman."When they talked to him, Simpson made the comment that he believed the memorabilia was his. We're getting conflicting stories from the two sides," said Jose Montoya, a spokesman for the LVMPD.Reports say that Beardsley was going to sell the items and made plans to meet with someone on Thursday night who was interested in purchasing them. The unnamed individual, along with OJ claimed to be police officers and ordered Beardsley to turn over his cellular phone, which he refused. He then claims one of the men "roughed him up" before stealing every collectible in the room.Police are expected to release a statement to the media later today.Former United States National Football League (NFL) star and Heisman Trophy winner O.J. Simpson has been allowed to post bail after being charged with ten felonies and one gross misdemeanor, in an alleged robbery that occurred in Las Vegas, Nevada on Friday September 14, 2007. Altogether, Simpson is facing 11 charges.The judge presiding over the case, Justice of the Peace Joe Bonaventure Jr. has granted the prosecutions request that the bail for his release be set at US$125,000, but the bail comes with other conditions as well. According to one of Simpson's lawyers Yale Galanter, the bail agreement was reached with the prosecution days before today's hearing, and Simpson only had to pay $19,000 of the $125,000 to get out of jail.Simpson must also surrender his passport in 24 hours and is only allowed to travel within the mainland United States. Simpson is also "not allowed to have any contact whatsoever with any witness" or individual on the side of the prosecution which includes "no third-party contacting" and "no carrier pigeons." Simpson was later released a few hours after the hearing.After the hearing, during a press conference outside the courtroom Galanter stated that he would "be taking action" against an attorney who appeared on the FOX News Channel on Tuesday night who falsely identified himself as Simpson's attorney."We are his only attorneys," said Galanter during the press conference.Simpson's lawyers had to speak over the large number of bystanders and media, some whom were cheering when Galanter said he would be released shortly. One man standing next to Galanter suddenly yelled "nice job guy! That's right, up high!," as he was attempting to give Galanter a 'high-five.'Simpson was charged with kidnapping with a deadly weapon robbery, and other charges on September 14 after, according to Simpson, he performed his "own sting operation" to retrieve sports memorabilia items and other "personal" items that allegedly belonged to Simpson. Reports say that the total value of all the items combined is over $100,000.There are at least seven other individuals facing charges in the alleged robbery. Walter Alexander, Clarence Stewart, Tom Scotto and Michael McClinton are all allegedly accomplices of Simpson. Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley are both dealers in sports memorabilia. Thomas Riccio is the owner of an auction who let Simpson know about the items that were going to be sold. Riccio also has an audio tape of the entire incident, which he recorded.The next hearing is scheduled for October 22. Clark County District Attorney David Roger will be the presiding prosecutor for the State of Nevada.Former National Football League star O.J.

While aboard his US Airways flight from Las Vegas, Simpson nodded and smiled at the other passengers in the economy class section of the plane. He also signed a few autographs.New York Post reporter Steve Dunleavy, who was aboard the same airplane as Simpson said, "between dozing and watching the movie 'Oceans 13,' [Simpson] didn't look the least stressed. In fact, he was rather relaxed."In an appearance on the The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday night, United States President Barack Obama told host, Jay Leno, that he had bowled at the White House bowling alley and scored a 129."It was like the Special Olympics or something," the President said.The Special Olympics is an international organization that promotes self-confidence and social skills for people with intellectual disabilities. It organizes the Special Olympics World Games which is recognized by the International Olympic Committee and is similar to the Paralympic Games which are for people with physical disabilities.Even before the taped show was aired, Barack Obama called the chairman of the Special Olympics to apologize. He phoned Timothy Shriver from Air Force One on the way back to Washington, D.C.. Tim Shriver is also the son of Eunice Kennedy Shriver who founded the Special Olympics."He expressed his disappointment, and he apologized in a way that was very moving. He expressed that he did not intend to humiliate this population," Shriver said on Friday in an interview on Good Morning America."Words hurt, words do matter," Shriver added. "People with special needs are great athletes and productive citizens.""The President made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics," White House deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, said. "He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world."Meanwhile, Kolan McConiughey, a top Special Olympics bowler told the Associated Press that he doesn't think Obama bowls like a Special Olympian."He bowled a 129. I bowl a 300. I could beat that score easily," McConiughey said. McConiughey has five perfect 300 games on his track record as a bowler and averages a score of 212."I'd tell him to get a new bowling ball, new shoes and bring him down to the lane," said McConiughey, offering bowling advice to the President. "Keep his body straight, his arm straight and keep his steps straight. He has to practice every single day."Maria Shriver, sister of Tim Shriver, said the President's comment "hurts millions of people throughout the world."California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is married to Maria Shriver, said, "He [Obama] loves Special Olympics, and he would do everything he can to help Special Olympics."Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters, "I know that the President believes that the Special Olympics are a triumph of the human spirit, and I think he understands that they deserve a lot better than — than the thoughtless joke that he made last night. And he apologizes for that."The following deaths were reported yesterday:Odense Squash Club (OSC) won the Danish team club championship in squash.

OSC beat Herlev/Hjorten Squash (Herlev) 6-1 in the final.OSC was the favourite to take the gold this weekend, as they had already won league play with a comfortable lead over København Squash Klub (KSK), and therefore had home court and could pick their opponent in the first semi-final. OSC chose to play Åbyhøj Squash Klub (ÅSK) in the first semi final, and beat them with ease 6-1, only loosing the women's second to Ditte Nielsen (ÅSK).During the other semi, the favoured professionals from KSK, ran in to serious problems, as injured star player Alex Stait was not able to play for KSK giving the young Herlev team a chance in this semi. After 5 matches and down by two matches, Mikkel Kragholm (Herlev) and Thomas Pilak (Herlev) became double match winners when they each beat their opponents by 3-0 and 3-1, winning the match 4-3 for Herlev.The final was, however, dominated by OSC, and Herlev wasn't ever in the match. Only Danish individual champion Morten Sørensen was able to win for Herlev. Herlev lost the rest of the matches. OSC's players proved to be to strong for last years bronze winners from Herlev. OSC won the Danish championship 6-1 in the final at Squash Center Danmark in Odense.File:BeijingOlimpicGames2008-08-08.jpgOfficials representing the Beijing Olympic Games in China have confirmed that the organizations in charge of the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Summer Olympics may have faked at least two parts of the production. The ceremony lasted a total of four and a half hours.It has been revealed that nine-year-old Lin Miaoke, who performed "Ode to the Motherland" during the ceremony, was only a visual effect. A recording of another girl's voice played throughout the stadium and on the television and radio broadcasts. It is also now known that that some of the fireworks shown on television were computer-generated imagery.The New York Times reports Lin's voice was not perfect, and a member of the Chinese Politburo demanded that a more suitable voice was used. Organizers found that voice in seven-year-old Yang Peiyi. Another girl was used in rehearsals, but she was deemed to be too old."The reason was for the national interest," Chen Qigang, the opening ceremonies general music designer, said Sunday during a radio interview. "The child on camera should be flawless in image, internal feeling and expression."Filmmaker Zhang Yimou, the production's director, praised Lin at a press conference with Chinese media."She’s very cute and sings quite well, too," he said according to a transcript of the news conference. "I was moved every time we did a rehearsal on this, from the bottom of my heart."The initial performer was a ten-year-old girl who was not named in the report and "whose voice was really good," but Zhang decided that she was too old. About ten girls were auditioned for the role at Central People’s Radio Station in Beijing."After the recording, we thought that Lin Miaoke’s voice was not very suitable," Chen Qigang said during his radio interview with Beijing Music Radio. "Finally, we made the decision that the voice we would use was Yang Peiyi’s."During the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, tenor Luciano Pavarotti mimed to a recorded version of the song he was singing. The recording was of him, but the singer, then 70 years old, had problems with a cold and opted to lip sync.Raffi Torres and Ethan Moreau each scored as the Edmonton Oilers defeated the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 2-1 at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim Saturday night.

Werber died of natural causes on Thursday, January 22, 2009 at an assisted living center in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was moved there after his health deteriorated a month ago.His son said that when admitted, Werber refused to eat solid foods and would only drink liquids. "He just refused to eat and that was his plan," Bill Werber Jr. told the Associated Press. He added that his father was "sharp up until four weeks ago".Born William Murray Werber on June 20, 1908 in Berwyn Heights, Maryland, he played for the New York Yankees from (1930, 1933), the Boston Red Sox from (1933-1936), the Philadelphia Athletics from (1937-1938), Cincinnati Reds from (1939-1941) and the New York Giants from (1942). In 1934, Werber became the starting third baseman of the Red Sox.

One of the most aggressive baserunners of the 1930s, probably the most aggressive next to Ben Chapman, he stole 215 bases. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1961.His wife Kathryn 'Tat' Werber died in 2000, after she and Werber had been married 70 years. Bill Werber Jr. says that his father is to be cremated and services, which will be open to the public, will be held on the weekend of January 31 through February 1.Jared Foster, a transfer quarterback with the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) Rebels football team, was arrested yesterday in Oxford, Mississippi and charged with selling steroids.Rebels head coach Houston Nutt said that Foster will not be allowed to remain with the team.Foster was arrested for alcohol possession by a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor in 2006 while a star player for Madison Central High School in Madison, Mississippi. Prosecutors agreed then not to try the case on the conditions that Foster help police in a steroid investigation and stay out of trouble.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that biathlete Olga Pyleva, Russian Federation, has been excluded from the XX Olympic Winter Games after failing an anti-doping test carried out by the IOC. This is the first instance of an athlete being ejected from the 2006 Winter Olympics.Pyleva, 30, tested positive for carphedon, a prohibited substance, on February 13 after the women's 15 km individual, biathlon event, in which she won the silver medal.ITAR-TASS News Agency reports that Pyleva tested positive for cordedon, a stimulant banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).  The substitute, phenotropil, was prescribed by her doctors following an ankle injury according to Nikolai Durmanov, head of the Russian Anti Doping Committee.The IOC determined that Pyleva would be disqualified from the 15km Women’s Individual Biathalon, would be excluded from the remainder of the XX Olympic Winter Games and would have her Olympic accreditation immediately withdrawn.The IOC routinely performs pre and post event tests for a broad array of illegal substances.  For each individual sport, the top five finishers plus two random finishers are tested.  So far the IOC has conducted 400 of the expected 1,200 tests to be done at these games.Under IOC rules, Olympians that test positive for a banned substance are considered guilty regardless of circumstances.Martina Glagon of Germany, who finished with a Bronze medal, will be awarded the Silver.  Albina Akhatova, Pyleva's Russian teammate will get the Bronze.On Monday, the Olympic torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics was lit in Olympia, Greece as per tradition. The Games of the XXIX Olympiad are scheduled to be held in and around Beijing, China from August 8, 2008, to August 24, 2008.Members of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), and others, were able to break through the police cordon. "We cannot let the Chinese government seize the Olympic flame, a symbol of peace, without denouncing the dramatic human rights situation in the country," RSF said in a statement.While Liu Qi, president of the Beijing Organizing Committee and a former mayor of Beijing, delivered a speech, at least one protester was able to run up behind him and display a flag that resembled the Olympic flag, except it was black and the rings were handcuffs.The protester was quickly apprehended and Liu Qi continued his speech relatively uninterrupted. "The Olympic flame will radiate light and happiness, peace and friendship, and hope and dreams to the people of China and the whole world," he told the crowd."Shame on China. Don't send China's blood-tainted torch to Tibet. Free Tibet. Tibet is an independent country," shouted Tenzin Dorjee, a leader for Students for a Free Tibet, while he was taken by police."All we wanted to do was break into the torch relay and shout that this is a torch of shame as the Chinese government continues to kill hundreds of our people," Dorjee said later. "They were stalking me from the moment I touched down to Greece," he added.The torch is still scheduled to be carried around the world in a relay that will go through twenty countries before arriving in Beijing for the start of the Games.Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has defended having the Games in China, saying, "The major political leaders don't want a boycott." In his speech Monday, he said, "The torch is the link between all athletes and citizens of this world; between all of us who believe in Olympism and the virtue of sport. It has the force to unite humanity and to stand for harmony." Germany's Olympic Committee rejected a boycott of the games aimed at events in Tibet. Noting that the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott did not avert the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the president of the committee said they concluded that the role of sports is to start dialog and promote understanding — and not to exert political pressure.Residents of the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Illinois celebrated Evan Lysacek Day last Friday. Held in honor of the gold medalist in figure skating at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, the day started with a rally at the former Naperville resident's high school, Neuqua Valley High School. Neuqua awarded Lysacek its first-ever Distinguished Alumni Award. He was the first American since 1988 to win the gold in men's figure skating, having started the sport since he was eight. Despite being busy with other engagements and starring in the TV show Dancing with the Stars, Lysacek was excited about the opportunity to visit his hometown. He also took the opportunity to thank his former teachers, who he said worked hard to keep him caught up in his studies amidst his hectic skating career. "I've been waiting to get back home and celebrate with the community that's backed me and been so instrumental in my development as a person, as an athlete and take this opportunity to say thank you, not just to the community but more so to the faculty here," he told the crowd at Neuqua. The skater's achievements have inspired the residents of his hometown. "I was inspired by what he showed me. He showed that I can do anything I want to do," said Neuqua student Gbenja Okubaja. At a Chamber of Commerce lunch held later that day, Naperville Mayor A. George Pradel awarded Lysacek the key to the city, saying "I don't know what it opens, but I've been told its already opened the hearts of everyone here in Naperville." In response Lysacek joked, "I hear it opens all the banks here in Naperville."Afterwards, Lysacek attended a fundraiser held in honor of skater and long-time friend Stephanie Joseph, who died of cancer at the age of 21.August 10, 2008 is the 2nd major day of the 2008 Olympic games, the below article lists some of the highlights.

Bennett-Awad, 35, is in a stable condition in the Royal London Hospital.The Canadian rider fell reportedly at the third fence, a fence with musical notes which may distract horses.  Bennett-Awad's horse, Gin and Juice, is said to have previously bucked its rider resulting in several hospital trips. Hawley was not the only one who fell today. Reportedly about six riders fell on the course, which is 5.7 kilometres with sharp turns and several drops.After the fall, she was eliminated from the event.Today, the Olympic torch went out three times while traveling through Paris, France. Olympic officials claim that this came as a result of actions by Pro-Tibetan protesters. It has been reported that the torch was extinguished, then put on a bus to keep it safe. The torch was extinguished one time by a Chinese official when the torch was in the hands of David Douillet, and one time due to technical problems. Sylvain Garel, of the Green Party and member of the Paris City Council tried to catch the torch from bearer Stephane Diagana's hands.A ceremony on City Hall Plaza was canceled, "by Chinese officials" according to Paris' mayor Bertrand Delanoë. A banner with "Paris defends human rights around the world" was installed on the City Hall.Reporters without Borders, head of the protest in France, put a banner on the Eiffel Tower and on Notre-Dame de Paris by its Secretary-General Robert Ménard.This action comes soon after the official news agency of China described the actions by the protesters as "vile misdeeds". A spokesman for Beijing 2008 said “the torch represents the Olympic spirit and people welcome the torch.” A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee said that the IOC is concerned about the situation in Tibet, although they do not encourage people to disrupt the ceremonies. The spokesperson said "The International Olympic Committee has expressed its serious concern and calls for a rapid peaceful resolution in Tibet." He did, however, say that the style of protesting was "not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the Olympic Games". The BBC has reported that 500 protesters were present in Paris today. Yesterday, protesters tried to grab and extinguish the torch in London, without success.The events were not broadcast live, as a Chinese Committee demanded to screen the footage prior to broadcast.The Olympic torch relay in San Francisco, California, began today at 1:00 p.m. PDT (UTC-7). It was the only stop for the torch in the United States, as it makes its way around the world to Beijing, China, for the 2008 Summer Olympics.The route for the torch was materially altered as protesters filled the streets along the planned route. The route, which was originally 10 kilometres long, was shortened by nearly half, according to the San Francisco Police Department. In hopes that all eighty of the scheduled torch carriers would get a chance to carry the torch, the carriers ran in pairs.The first torch carrier ran as scheduled, but then carried it into a warehouse, from which a motorcycle was observed leaving. The torch was then spotted again on a major street nearly two miles off course.The rerouting was carefully planned, according to San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who told Associated Press, that it was because of "a disproportionate concentration of people in and around the start of the relay."The closing ceremonies were held at San Francisco International Airport instead of the planned waterfront location at AT&T Park.Matt Helmenstine, 30, a California high school teacher carrying a Tibetan flag told Reuters: "I think it's cowardly. If they can't run the torch through the city, it means that no one is supporting the games.""This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for us to see the torch," said Nancy Chan, a local resident, to the San Francisco Chronicle. "There is a lot of politics around it, but that is the great thing about America - the free speech." She and her 4-year-old son ran to the new route when it was announced.At least one protester was arrested, Xiao Tan, 32, of Chinese origin, who tried to unfurl a Tibetan flag. "I'm proud to be Chinese, but I don't like what's happening in Tibet," he told AFP. The Vancouver Sun reported a number of arrests, but says that violence is limited.Peter Ueberroth, the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, said that the right balance had been reached, between preserving freedom of speech for protesters, while still providing an exhilarating experience for torchbearers, as well as preventing a repeat of the chaotic demonstrations that accompanied the torch in London and Paris.Already Tuesday evening, hundreds paraded with Tibetan flags while chanting "Shame on China". On Monday, protesters hung banners from the Golden Gate Bridge. As the torch went to London and Paris, the torch relay was subject to large scale protests in both cities.Tight security was planned in advance. Airspace restrictions have been put in place and over 700 security personnel are expected to be deployed including FBI agents. Police leave was cancelled. The United States Coast Guard patrolled the part of the route that was to take the torch along the waterfront at Fisherman's Wharf."We are trying to accomplish two goals here. One is to protect the right to free speech and the other is to ensure public safety, and here in San Francisco we are good at both of those things," said Nathan Ballard about the security. Ballard is a spokesperson for San Francisco Mayor's office."I am saddened that such a beautiful symbol of the torch, which unites people of different religions, different ethnic origin, different political systems, cultures and languages, has been attacked," said Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, to the Wall Street Journal.The Beijing Organizing Committee said in a statement on Monday: "We strongly condemn the actions of the few 'pro-Tibet independence' activists who have attempted to sabotage the Olympic Torch Relay. The Olympic flame belongs to the world and these actions are a serious violation of the Olympic spirit. They are bound to fail and will surely arouse the resentment of peace-loving people who support the Olympic Games."The Olympic torch has returned to Chinese soil. More than 1 million Hong Kong residents and visitors ignored light showers on Friday to greet and cheer the Olympic torch relay. Hong Kong is the first Chinese destination to welcome the Olympic flame after its month-long journey across the world, spanning 19 cities.It was the Hong Kong's first Olympic torch relay since the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The eight-hour torch run included carrying the flame aboard a dragon boat across the Shing Mun River, and on horseback into the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Venue and Sha Tin Racecourse. Hong Kong, a co-host city of the Beijing Games in August, will stage the equestrian events."Today, the Olympic torch relay resumes on Chinese soil after its global journey across five continents. It is a great and solemn honor for Hong Kong, Asia's world city, to be the first in China to welcome back the Olympic flame on behalf of our proud nation," said Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang.The torch relay began at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre at Tsim Sha Tsui where 1996 Atlanta Olympic gold medalist for windsurfing, Lee Lai-shan received the torch from Chief Executive, Donald Tsang. Lee then handed the Olympic flame to Olympic table tennis silver medalist Li Ching, who passed it to his doubles partner Ko Lai-Chak. Lee said, "It is one of my big moments and I am feeling the same excitement I did when I won the Olympic gold medal."Early in the morning, a large number of people gathered on both sides of Nathan Road in preparation for the events. Many of the spectators wore red clothes to match the colour of the Chinese flag.One hundred and twenty torchbearers carried the torch on a 26-km route. The torch bearers passed landmarks such as the Tsing Ma Bridge and the Avenue of Stars, before it was ferried across Victoria Harbor to Hong Kong Island.Asian Games champion cyclist Wong Kam-po was the last to the carry the Olympic torch. Wong carried the torch to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai, where he lit the cauldron, pulling down the curtain and ending the Hong Kong leg of the torch relay.Artistic gymnastics events at the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games concluded yesterday with two gold medal wins for China and gold medals for the Netherlands and the United States.China's Feng Zhe won gold in the men's parallel bars, just narrowly beating out the German gymnast Marcel Nguyen by 0.166 points.China also claimed a gold with Deng Linlin scoring a 15.600 in the women's beam. The balance beam proved treacherous for some: Gabrielle Douglas, considered a favourite for the event, came seventh after a dramatic fall. The United States did manage to get a bronze on the beam thanks to Alexandra Raisman who pulled off a routine that received enormous applause. She initially got less points than Romania's Catalina Ponor, but took the bronze after an appeal.The men's horizontal bar event was a volley of high-scoring, high-difficulty routines. Danell Leyva from the United States started with a strong 15.833 point routine. China's Zhang Chenglong then grabbed the lead by earning 16.266 points. The German gymnast Fabian Hambuchen raised the bar even further with a 16.400 routine. The Dutch gymnast Epke Zonderland performed a near-flawless and immensely difficult routine that earned 16.533 points, earning him both a gold medal and a standing ovation from the audience in the North Greenwich Arena.Zonderland's performance makes him the first Dutch gymnast to win gold at the Olympics since the win for the Dutch women's team at the Amsterdam Games in 1928. Hambuchen got a silver medal and the Chinese gymnast Zou Kai took bronze.In the women's floor event, the eighteen-year-old United States gymnast Alexandra Raisman secured a second gold after her success in the women's team event last week. As in the beam event, she narrowly beat out Catalina Ponor from Romania with a score of 15.600 to 15.200. Aliya Mustafina from Russia took home bronze for her 14.900 point routine.According to the Scotsman newspaper, the directors of the 2012 London Olympics have insisted that the city won the right to host the games "fairly and squarely" after claims were touted by an Israeli official that a "potentially decisive vote was cast in error by an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official"The Israeli official, Alex Gilady, claims that in the third round of voting, Greek delegate Lambis Nikolaou may have accidentally voted for Paris rather than Madrid, resulting in eliminating Madrid rather than Paris from the final round. London spokesmen and bid leaders have dismissed the claims as "folklore stories", "totally irrelevant" and "tittle-tattle", while the CEO of the Madrid bid told the London Times, "We were very close to winning. We can never know if the Greek vote would have been decisive, but it is lamentable for one human error to have ruined all our hard work."One of the most important sport events of northern Greece takes place this weekend in Litochoro, Greece. The Skai Olympus Marathon started yesterday in the roots of the famous mountain, with athletes starting from a sea-level altitude follow 44km of trails at the slopes of Mt.Olympus and reach the height of 2780m. The Greek weightlifter and three-time Olympic champion Pyrros Dimas gave the sign for the start, from the town of Dion. The race was won by Alexis Gounko of Greece. Tonight the event will conclude with a ceremony in Litochoro's central park.Saturday in a game played at Colegio San Agustin in Madrid in Spain's top level wheelchair basketball league, CD Fundosa ONCE decisively beat Getafe BSR 86–36.

The Ogden-based qualifying competition was an opportunity for Australia to qualify additional archers and both a men's and a women's team with three available spots for each. On the men's team side, with Taylor Worth, Sky Kim, and Ryan Tyack representing the country, Australia beat Turkey 214–204 in the 1/8th round, then beat Romania 216–203 to qualify for the semi-finals.  Australia's men lost to India 209–221 to go into the bronze medal match, where they lost to Chinese Taipei 214–216.  With only the top three national teams qualifying, Australia did not qualify for the last available Olympic spot for the men's team event.On the women's side, the Australian team of Elisa Barnard, Alice Ingley, and Deonne Bridger was eliminated early on and did not advance to the knockout round.In the men's individual elimination competition, Tyack beat Peart of Great Britain 6–4 and lost to Duenas of Canada 3–7.  Worth beat Hristov of Bulgaria 6–0, fellow Australian Kim 6–2, and the United States's Ellison 6–4 and Wukie 6–4, before losing to Luis of Mexico 3–7. Kim beat Gankin of Kazakhstan 6–4 before losing to his teammate Worth.  Matthew Masonwells beat Curchod of Switzerland 6–2 before losing to Tilmaz of Turkey 3–7.In the women's individual elimination competition, Alice Ingley went out in the first round following a 2–6 loss to Lee of Canada. Deonne Bridger also went out in the first round following a loss to Oyunsuren of Mongolia. Elisa Barnard had more success, beating Gonzalez of Mexico 7–3 and Jager of Denmark 6–4 before being eliminated 4–6 in a match against Oliver of Great Britain.Australia will likely be sending Western Australian Taylor Worth and New South Walesman Elisa Barnard to the Games, continuing a tradition of Australian archers competing at the Olympics since the sport was re-introduced to the programme in 1972.London is preparing for Le Grand Départ of the 2007 Tour de France. The route, which will run through the Greenwich Millennium Village, is being prepared for the Départ. The Tour de France will be in London and the South East for the two days of the 7th and 8th of July. The event will start in Trafalgar Square at 15:00 BST (UTC+1)."I believe this will be the most spectacular Grand Départ the Tour has ever seen and the weekend will underline London’s great sporting reputation," said Ken Livingstone, mayor of London.The parts of the Tour that London will be hosting are the Prologue and Stage One. The Prologue will be on Saturday, the 7th of July, starting in Trafalgar Square at 15:00 BST and finishing at 18:20 BST. Stage One will be on the following day, starting in Greenwich at 11:00 BST and finishing in Canterbury, Kent.Over the years the Tour de France has seen 52 British riders; the first being Charley Holland and Bill Burl in 1937. Londoners may get to see today's riders on their two wheels, but they will be followed by 1,500 vehicles, 13,000 policemen and women patrolling the route and 2,300 members of the world press.During the event many roads will be closed along the route and off it. The official website provides detailed information.At 12:50 pm on January 3, a ski chairlift ride cost a German skier's life and another German woman was left with serious injuries after the lift cable derailed from the mast sheaves in a windstorm. The derailed chairlift is the two-seater Fallboden lift at Kleine Scheidegg, next to the Jungfrau mountain in Switzerland. Two more Australian tourists were lightly injured. About 20 further people had to be evacuated from the stopped chairlift. Wind velocity peaking at 90km/h prevented a helicopter from rescuing the trapped passengers, complicating the rescue. According to 20min.ch, the lift was manufactured by Garaventa AG, a major Swiss ski lift company, now a part of an international group Doppelmayr/Garaventa. When contacted no one was available for comment.Shortly before the accident, a wind alarm was activated few times by a 60km/h wind. The operator decided to close the lift and waited for the lift to unload all passengers; at the moment of the catastrophe the bottom station of the lift was already closed, but 75 passengers were still on the lift.According to the Swiss law, every chair lift must be designed to withstand a lateral wind load of 250 newtons (approx. 25kg) per square meter. However there is no law limit at which wind speed or lateral loads the chair lifts have to be stopped. This safety aspect is left to the responsibility of the operator. The safety of the lift was checked by the Swiss Federal Office of Transport in January 2006. This chairlift accident is said to be the worst in Switzerland for the last 8 years.Two web sites purporting to sell tickets to the 2008 Summer Olympic Games due to open in Beijing, China on Friday have been the subject of lawsuits from the International Olympic Committee in United States courts in recent weeks. The web sites, beijingticketing.com and beijing-2008tickets.com, were designed to resemble official sites and often appeared above the official sites in Google searches, and scammed some victims out of up to US$50,000 each for tickets to events such as the Opening Ceremony and swimming, which were listed despite the official Beijing ticket web site stating that tickets to all events had sold out as of July 27. The sites are believed to have taken in millions of dollars in total.Ken Gamble, a private investigator from Sydney, Australia, believes the sites are operated by Terance Shepherd, whom Gamble has been tracking for several years in relation to other fraudulent web sites selling tickets to events such as the FIFA World Cup. According to Gamble, Shepherd's modus operandi involves setting up the fake web sites, overselling the tickets, and then failing to produce the tickets. "The story's always the same," Gamble said, "it's an 'unfortunate mistake' or someone has 'let them down'. They promise a refund, which never happens, and the credit companies end up paying all the refunds." Shepherd owns a home in the London suburb of Blackheath, although authorities believe he is currently hiding in Barbados.On Monday, beijingticketing.com customers received an email from someone named "Alan Scott", claiming that the site's ticket supplier had filed for bankruptcy. The email recommended that customers should contact their credit card companies to seek refunds "immediately", and said that the company would set up a call centre to provide assistance to its customers. However, the site has been shut down and a phone number previously listed on it has been disconnected. The company's address, in Phoenix, Arizona, was found to be an empty office space. Visa International has stated that victims who used their Visa card to pay should be able to get their money back, but it is not yet clear whether the same will apply to all customers.Nico Rosberg won the opening race of this year's Formula 1 season in Australia yesterday. TV commentators  spoke of "fascination throughout the field" as big names retired and new names proved themselves.Former champion Lewis Hamilton qualified on pole but problems were evident by the second lap when he received a team radio message telling him "we need to retire... save the engine, save the engine!" Another followed rapidly, however, telling him to "just stay out, stay out, just keep on rolling". Hamilton left the race on the fourth lap.Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel did not fare much better, having only qualified twelfth, with engine woes of his own. He too quit the race in the early stages, staying behind to watch the race and, according to commentator and retired Scottish F1 racer David Coulthard, learn what he could from the sidelines.Vettel and Hamilton were not the only stars retiring early. Veteran  racer Felipe Massa was rammed from behind by Kobiashi's Caterham, sending both cars out and prompting deployment of yellow flags for several laps while the debris was recovered. The crash was triggered by Kobiashi clipping Kimi Raikkonen, damaging the front of Kobiashi's car. Raikkonen stayed in the race and managed to finish eighth. The first ten cars over the finish line score points towards both the driver's and constructor's championships.Coulthard and fellow commentators believe Kobiashi, who took responsibility for the accident, may receive points on his racer's licence in a new system to deal with transgressions introduced this year. Kobiashi called the crash "My mistake[... I] should have braked earlier, and I apologise to Felipe". Massa said Kobiashi "cannot do a start like that, every time" he does so will lead to an accident.More drama followed shortly after when Valteri Bottas clipped a wall on lap 10, breaking the rim of his back-right wheel. The rim was left on the track, followed shortly thereafter by the tyre off the wheel. The safety car was deployed for several laps until the debris was recovered. Despite the setback Bottas climbed back up the standings and finished in sixth place.Many drivers, including cars at the front of the pack, took advantage of the safety car period to do pit stops.  Some are now considering using less fuel than the maximum allowance in a move the FIA never expected technologically possible when drafting the rules several years ago. It was a day for débutantes at Albert Park, a street circuit where racing took place in close proximity to busy public roads. Newcomer Kevin Magnussen scored third place on his first F1 race, while fellow rookie Daniil Kvyat came in tenth and became the youngest-ever F1 points scorer. Kvyat takes the record from Vettel by several months while Magnussen becomes the first Dane on an F1 podium.Not every débutante was so lucky; Caterham driver Marcus Eriksson dropped out of his first race after being radioed  "Stop the car, stop the car, engine oil pressure". Established racers Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean, both Lotus drivers, also stopped with technical trouble. All three cars pulled up at the side of the track on different laps, each triggering yellow flags. Despite the retirements, fourteen cars finished which was more than some commentators were expecting. Hamilton was upbeat about his retirement, saying "It's tough for everyone but that's the way it is" and adding "We're not the only ones [to have difficulties]". Vettel was more pessimistic, claiming this is "going to be a long season". Asked about the cause of his engine troubles, Hamilton said "One of the cylinders, I think, was not firing".The race was unusual from start to finish, having been shortened by one lap after the first start was aborted by amber lights instead of just green. The end is more controversial; home driver Daniel Ricciardo scored his first-ever Australian Grand Prix podium finish in second place but was later disqualified for an alleged breach of fuel regulations. Ricciardo had been the first Australian driver to stand on the podium in his home country since Formula 1 brought the event into the championship format used today.His disqualification is not final, however. His team, Red Bull, have vowed to appeal. If the appeal fails all the drivers below him move up one position, meaning first-time entrant Magnussen will have come in second place and Kvyat will be ninth. That would see Sergio Perez score a point for Force India by moving into tenth. Perez's race was hampered early by a puncture picked up in the opening lap. Ricciardo was reported to the stewards by technical delegate Jo Bauer who claimed his car "exceeded consistently the maximum allowed fuel flow of 100kg/h". 100kg is also the maximum fuel allowed on board cars, a new limit set for this season.  The fuel flow rule is also new this year; F1 cars averaged about 170kg/h last year.Ricciardo was disqualified after five hours of steward deliberations. Red Bull have hit back with a statement saying many teams  have found the FIA's fuel flow meter to be faulty. They say they are "confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations." Today Andrew Westacott, chief executive of the Australian Grand Prix, said the appeal outcome may not be known for weeks.Prior to Ricciardo's disqualification, the remaining point-scorers were Jensen Button in fourth, Fernando Alonso in fifth, Nico Hulkenberg in seventh, and Jean-Eric Vergne in ninth.Racers and fuel rules were not the only things fresh for this race. Williams are on the back of their worst-ever season and have changed their livery to brighter, whiter cars. Another new innovation is the introduction of red lights on the rear of cars that blink when the vehicle is not using electricity, warning the car behind of possible deceleration. F1 cars also now sport hybrid turbo engines.Rosberg, speaking after what is his first Australian victory, said it is "Such a pleasure to have such a fast car." He came a full 24 seconds ahead of Ricciardo. It is also the hundredth victory by an F1 car powered by a Mercedes engine."Whatever the outcome I'm really proud of what I did today", Ricciardo said as he awaited the stewards' disqualification decision. "There are more positives than negatives".University of Oregon football's star running back, LeGarrette Blount, was suspended for the remainder of the season – and thereby the remainder of his college football career – after punching an opposing player after the opening game.The University of Oregon Ducks opened their 2009 season with a 19–8 loss to rival Boise State Broncos. The high-profile game was nationally televised on the ESPN network. The Broncos, whose "mid-major" Western Athletic Conference is less competitive than the Ducks' Pac-10 Conference, had previously defeated the Ducks in 2008. Prior to the game, Blount was quoted by Sports Illustrated as saying the Ducks "owe [the Broncos] an ass-whuppin’" for the late hits delivered in the 2008 game. The volatile Blount, coming off a 1,000+ yard season in which he broke a school record for rushing touchdowns, had struggled in several 2008 games, including the encounter with the Broncos.The Broncos, however, won 19–8 in their home field; and Blount and Oregon's offense failed to achieve a single first down for the game's first 37 minutes.A few seconds after the end of the game,  Boise State defensive end Byron Hout taunted Blount and pushed him on the shoulder pad. Broncos Head Coach Chris Petersen attempted to restrain Hout. But Blount responded with a swift punch to the jaw, knocking Hout to the ground. Hout was not publicly disciplined for his actions. Blount then pushed teammate Garrett Embry, who was attempting to restrain him. Boise State replayed the punch on their large screen in the end-zone multiple times, before Blount had returned to the locker room.As he was escorted to the locker room, Blount confronted jeering Boise State fans. Two police officers and Oregon assistant coach Scott Frost restrained Blount and escorted him into the locker room. Video of the incident spread rapidly on the Internet.Blount apologized after the incident, saying: "I just apologize to everybody that was watching this — ESPN, national TV — I just apologize to all of our fans, all the Boise fans. It was just something that I shouldn't have done. I lost my head, and I shouldn't have taken it that far." Coach Chip Kelly suspended Blount for the remainder of the 2009 season.  Blount was not dismissed from the team, however, and will be permitted to attend practice and retain his scholarship.The incident was seen an important test for a leadership team in its first year. According to Oregon Athletic Director Mike Bellotti, the fact that the incident occurred after the game's conclusion made it the team's responsibility, rather than a Pac-10 issue. Kelly, Bellotti, and University of Oregon President Lariviere had each just entered the first year of his position. Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott, also in his first year, was in attendance at the game. He consulted with Oregon officials in advance of Blount's suspension, and afterward, the Pac-10 expressed complete support for the suspension, while declining to comment on the Broncos, who are not part of the Pac-10.As a result of his negative rushing total (-5 yards) in the one game he played in the 2009 season prior to the suspension, combined with 1,002 yards in 2008, Blount holds the unusual distinction of having a 1,000-yard season with the Ducks, but less than 1,000 yards over his entire NCAA career.Rafael Palmeiro, the Havana, Cuba born left-handed first baseman for the Major League Baseball team Baltimore Orioles, returned to play following a 10-game suspension after testing positive for banned steroids. Orioles interim manager Sam Perlozzo had Mr. Palmeiro wait  three days in the dugout after his suspension before placing him in the play lineup.His first appearance at bat at the Sunday contest in Camden Yards against the Toronto Blue Jays before a crowd of 30, 954 - a 64% capacity - was met with mixed reaction. Mr. Palmeiro is under investigation for possible perjury after he testified under oath to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform  on March 17, 2005 that, "I have never used steroids. Period." "Raffy", his nickname among fans, was sixth at bat and designated hitter during the first inning and was walked by Blue Jays pitcher Miguel Batista. Mr. Palmeiro, aged 40 and with a .277 batting average, is only the fourth baseball player to have at least 3,000 hits and more than 500 home runs during his career. He has earned the ire of fans and players alike because of contentions that his steroid usage enabled him to accomplish the rare feat. Mr. Palmeiro's four at-bat appearances were less than stellar. He hit three grounders mid-game after being walked in the first inning. Baltimore trailed the Blue Jays 7-6 with two men on base and two outs in the ninth inning when Mr. Palmeiro was sent to bat. He hit a fly ball which was caught by Blue Jay right-fielder Alex Rios, thus ending the game, making it the Blue Jays' fifth win in six games. Afterwards, Mr. Palmeiro told reporters, "I just wanted to get a hit. My timing was off." Coach Perlozzo commented about Mr. Palmeiro's appearance saying, "I'm sure it's a relief to get it out of the way. He's probably gone in there, taken a deep breath and gone, 'Whew, I'm glad that's over with. Now I can go ahead and play real baseball.' "American golfer Orville Moody died yesterday aged 74. He was the winner of the 1969 U.S open. A former U.S army sergeant Moody gave up the military in 1967 to play a trail run on the PGA Tour, he earned almost $300,000 in one year. After 15 months of joining Moody was named PGA Player of the Year. Moody won the U.S open by only one strike with a 72-hole score of 281. Deane Beman, Al Geiberger and Bob Rosburg all finished the tournament with a score of 282. In 1989, he became only the fourth man to win both the U.S. Open and the U.S. Senior Open. No cause of death has been giving so far. Moody had a triple bypass heart surgery in 1995.The Saginaw Spirit and Ottawa 67's Ontario Hockey League teams faced off in a high-scoring competition Saturday night at The Dow Event Center in Saginaw, Michigan, with the Spirit topping the 67's at a score of 7-5.The Spirit made their mark in the first period, scoring three goals.  Tim Priamo scored the first goal of the night, followed by Tom Craig, who scored his first ever OHL goal.  Ryan McDonough rounded out the period with the Spirit's third goal.The second period continued a lead for the Spirit, with Patrick Asselin scoring another goal for the Spirit, making the score 4-0 before the 67's responded when Julian Talbot shot two goals in the period, making the score 4-2.  Saginaw's Tyson Gimblett and Ottawa's Joe Grimaldi held a fistfight on the ice during second period, with Gimblett drawing a two minute instigator penalty, along with a five minute fighting penalty and a ten minute misconduct during the incident. Grimaldi was charged with a five minute penalty for fighting. Another fight late in the period between the 67's Elgin Reid and the Spirit's Jamie Klie had both in the penalty box for five minutes.Third period goals, separated only by seconds, from Ottawa's Chris Hulit and Jamie McGinn took lead of the game for the 67's, upping the Spirit by one.  The Spirit responded with two of their own from Patrick McNeil and Matt Corrente, regaining the lead for Saginaw, 6-5.With only minutes remaining, Ottawa pulled their goalie from net to gain a man advantage. Saginaw's last goal of the game was scored by Michael Birner, making the final score of the game 7-5.The Spirit team maintains second position for their West division, behind the Plymouth Whalers.  The 67's are currently fourth in the East division.Rescue efforts are underway to free more than 200 skiers trapped Tuesday at Maine's Sugarloaf ski resort, which is located 120 miles north of Portland. Several injuries were reported after a ski lift broke down; an employee at the resort said this caused several people to fall to the ground. The Spillway East lift reportedly came to a halt during high winds due to a derailment. Around 10:30 a.m. ET, a cable slid over one tower's pulley leading to five chairs falling about 30 feet.Ethan Austin, a resort spokesperson, revealed that several individuals were taken to near-by hospitals with non-life-threatening conditions.  At the time, winds originating from this month's blizzard were blowing up to 43 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. Austin confirmed Tuesday afternoon that the lift was carrying around 220 people at the time of the breakdown.Efforts to remove trapped skiers are in progress Tuesday afternoon.Juan Pablo Montoya, who retired from Formula One before the 2006 French Grand Prix, drove his first laps in a NASCAR stockcar yesterday owned by Chip Ganassi whom he is to race for in the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup season.The test occurred at the Talladega Super Speedway where on Saturday he competed in an ARCA race in which he finished third.The Monday test also allowed NASCAR to test the COT ("Car of Tomorrow") which will be raced next year in select events.Montoya was the 1999 CART FedEx Championship Series champion. In 2000 he won the Indianapolis 500 as a rookie driving for the same Chip Ganassi Team.Patrick Harrington who was a former garda, was diagnosed with cancer in March when Padraig won his first US tour title.

"We are now treating [the death of Mr. Woolmer] as suspicious" he said at a news conference.Bob Woolmer unexpectedly died in his hotel room in Jamaica last Sunday shortly after Pakistan's shock defeat at the hands of Ireland.Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's cricket coach died at a university hospital in Kingston, Jamaica earlier today. Woolmer was found unconscious in his room at the Pegasus Hotel at 10:45 Sunday morning, only hours after Pakistan's Cricket World Cup exit at the hands of Ireland.After being found by hotel workers in his room, he was rushed to the emergency department at the University Hospital in Kingston, but doctors where not able to save him.  Team spokesman Parvez Mir reported that when he was found "He had blood on him and there was vomit on the walls."Mir also told media that Woolmer suffered from a medical condition, but that it was too early to decide whether or not it had anything to do with his death.Woolmer played 19 Tests for England and was the coach for Warwickshire and South Africa before becoming coach for Pakistan in 2004.  He was to remain coach until after the 2007 World Cup, and was tipped to replace Duncan Fletcher as the coach of England after his contract with the PCB expired.Ex-England international cricketer and Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer's death is now the subject of a murder investigation by police in Kingston, Jamaica.At a press conference last night, the Chief of Police confirmed that Woolmer's death at the age of 58 was the result of "manual strangulation".  Commenting on his death, the Deputy police commissioner, Mark Shields, said "Bob was a large man - It would have taken some significant force to subdue him."Jamaican police questioned members of the Pakistan cricket squad on Thursday, after which the team were fingerprinted and then allowed to leave for their hotel in Montego Bay. They are planning to return home to Pakistan on Saturday.Police are now studying CCTV footage from the hotel where the team are staying, in the hope of finding any clues as to the identity of Mr Woolmer's killers.The pathologist states that he had died from asphyxiation caused by manual strangulation.Pakistan defeated West Indies by 31 runs in the third and last match of cricket played at Abu Dhabi to win the Fortune Cup 3-nil on Sunday.

Ghafoor, known as the "Pakistani Pele" died afer a long illness. He was the captain of the Pakistani national football team during the 1960s and 70s.Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat, the President of the Pakistani Football Federation (PFF) released a statement after Ghafoor's death. He said “I was deeply saddened by the death of Pakistani Pele. This must be very difficult for all football lovers and players. Abdul Ghafoor was a kind person who will be greatly missed by all who knew him".The PFF has come under some criticism from the Pakistani media about it's lack of support for Ghafoor in his five years of illness.Ghafoor played his entire career in Pakistan playing for the Dhaka Mohammedan Club. He rejected offers to join clubs in such countries as Russia, China and Saudi Arabia to remain in his home country. During his international career he is credited with being part of the best Pakistani national team ever. During this time Pakistan recorded victories over such nations as China and the United Arab Emirates. They were also successful in winning the 1974 Asian Games. Today Pakistan have very little success in international football. They are ranked 177th in the FIFA World Rankings.Baltimore Orioles baseball fans had a chance to vote for their support of Major League Baseball's (MLB) steroid use and policies with their home game attendance Thursday night. Rafael Palmeiro, back after serving a 10-game suspension for testing positive for stanozolol, was notably not in the starting line-up against the visiting Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Attendance was on the thin side, around 27,000 attended at the 48,262 capacity stadium at Camden Yards.The Orioles concluded a 3-game sweep of the Rays with tonight's 4-2 win. Rafael Palmeiro watched from the dugout.Palmeiro, this season's embattled designated hitter and sometimes first baseman, is an Orioles star who in March made finger wagging and emphatic denials of steroid use during his testimony before the House Committee on Government Reform. It was later learned that MLB officials had evidence of his drug use prior to the Palmeiro testimony, but none of that was known until the scandalous aftermath caused by their August 1 suspension of him.Palmeiro responded to the suspension at a news conference that followed by saying he had no idea how traces of the steroid could be found in his urine, and that somehow he was an unwitting victim. The potent and easily detected steroid is almost always injected with a needle.  The House committee chairman, Tom Davis (R-VA), said Palmeiro voluntarily turned over documents that are being reviewed during their stepped up perjury investigation. MLB said they would turn over their documents today.The prospects currently look dim for a Palmeiro nomination to baseball's Hall of Fame. Previously, he was virtually assured a place.In a short meeting with ballpark press reporters before the game, Palmeiro, who earlier insisted he would not talk to the press said, "It's been a tough time for me and my family over the last couple of weeks, and at this time, I've been instructed by my attorneys not to comment on the situation. The time will come soon, hopefully, that I can explain my situation." A local sportswriter David Steele called on fans to stay home and hit the sport in its money pockets. "Wondering what to do tonight, the official end of Palmeiro's insultingly brief punishment, when he suits up again at Camden Yards? Try this: stay home."London, England —  With the 2012 Summer Paralympics starting in less than a week, parts of Papua New Guinea's Paralympic delegation arrived in London earlier today in order to support the pair of athletes the country qualified for the Games, athletics competitor Francis Kompaon and powerlifter Timothy Harabe.The Games are Kompaon's second, having competed at the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he earned his country's first Paralympic medal when he finished second in the 100 metre event. Harabe, only the tenth person ever to represent his country at the Games, is making his Paralympic Games debut.The British High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Jackie Barson, MBE, wished both athletes well, saying in a written statement, "It is a fantastic achievement for the PNG to be represented by two world class Paralympic athletes".PNG Paralympic Committee President Bernard Chan also congratulated his country's athletes, saying, "They will be great ambassadors for PNG and I hope both Francis and Timothy will inspire other athletes to train hard and hope to represent PNG at this Paralympic level during their participation."The 2012 Games will be the fourth time the country has participated, with the three other appearances happening at the 1984 Summer Paralympics, 2000 Summer Paralympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics. Other members of the Papua New Guinea 2012 Paralympic delegation include PNG Paralympic Committee President Bernard Chan; Chef de Mission Dr. Kefu Ma; team manager Rosemary Mawe; Davina Chan, the president's wife; coach William McKenny; and official Jeffrey Robby.Papua New Guinea (PNG) has defeated New Zealand (NZ) in the final round of the Australian Football International Cup. They previously finished second to Ireland in 2002 and New Zealand in 2005.New Zealand kicked to the Punt Road end in a high intensity first quarter. PNG went forward quickly only to be denied by a taller NZ defense. NZ were able to create space for their forwards though structured play. The quarter finished NZ three goals one behind (19) to PNG four behinds.PNG's first goal came from a mid air volly. The teams second came after two NZ goals including one to key forward and tournament leading goalkicker Richard Bradley. The half time scores were NZ five goals three behinds (33) to PNG two goals five behinds (17),PNG closed the gap to six points gaining the momentum before NZ added a goal and a behind. PNG closed the gap back to six before the final break. Three Quarter time scores: NZ six goals four behinds (40) to PNG four goals ten behinds (34). PNG rallied in the last quarter to go ahead and claim their first International Cup title in three attempts. NZ's structure faltered, if only briefly, allowing PNG, who had numbers behind the ball, back in the game.Trailing at every change, PNG kicked three goals two behinds to New Zealand's one goal in the last quarter to win 7.12 (54) to 7.4 (46).Two explorers have set off from Knightsbridge, London Wednesday morning (0900 GMT) in a propeller-powered dune buggy heading for the Sahara. Giles Cardozo, age 29, from Dorset, with chief pilot and expedition leader Neil Laughton, age 45, an ex-SAS officer, will fly and drive the amazing two-seater vehicle more than 6,000-km (3,750-miles) to fabled Timbuktu on February 20. "I just can't wait to see their faces when we fly in and start playing football with them. I don't think they will be able to believe somebody in a flying car has just visited them," 'extreme golfer' Mr Laughton said before the departure. Timbuktu (Timbuctoo; Koyra Chiini: Tumbutu; French: Tombouctou) is an isolated city in Tombouctou Region, in the West African nation of Mali. They will traverse Europe and Africa about 42 days to arrive at the city in Mali, West Africa before returning home via Senegal. The home-made 450-kilogram Skycar has been designed by Cardozo in just 18 months. It is the world's first road legal bio fuelled flying car. It is a four cylinders modified Rage Motorsport off-road racing buggy which was approved by the government last month. It runs on bioethanol and is powered by a modified 140bhp Yamaha R1 superbike engine with a lightweight automatic continuously variable transmission from a snowmobile.The team invested about £250,000 ($380,000) to make the 1000cc engine Skycar desert-proof. In its maiden voyage, the flying car will be escorted by up to 13 people convoy including an eight-wheel truck, two Toyota Land Cruiser 4x4s and several motorbikes. It has left London's Sheraton Park Tower hotel, heading through the capital to Dunsfold airfield in Surrey. The team had initially planned to take the air route across the English Channel, but the 35km flight was vetoed by aviation authorities. Skycar is required by law to obtain a license from Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), including a permit from the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA). Skycar spokeswoman, Charlie Bell, however clarified that the team was "in liaison with the CAA and they are looking to finalize the permit," adding that it is in order for the rest of the trip.The Skycar will thereafter fly over the high-altitude Pyrenees near Andorra, and would cross over the 14-km (nine-mile) Strait of Gibraltar. The prepared journey also includes the route through Mauritania, Atlas Mountains in Morocco and into Mali. It will further cross the harsh environment of Sahara’s remote “Rub' al Khali" (empty quarter), for up to two weeks amid real fears of terrorist attacks.The expedition will not have an easy task, especially since the Skycar will be tested to the limits amid punishing operating environments and weather conditions. "Clearly the reliability of the car is crucial," said Mr Laughton. "We're going to have to cope with wind chill temperatures as low as -30 deg C and blistering heat of up to 50 deg C. But it's been fully tested at a secret location and it 100 per cent works," he added.The Parajet Skycar is a prototype flying car. It was developed by British paramotor manufacturer Parajet. The flying car utilizes a paramotor and a parafoil attached to a modified dune buggy to achieve sustained level flight. Should the engine fail, the vehicle can glide back to the ground. Should the canopy rip, an emergency reserve parachute would be deployed. It requires three minutes to convert it from a car to an aircraft. The prototype runs on biodiesel and is fully road-legal.In 2004 British engineer Giles Cardozo, a paramotor manufacturer, has invented a fan-powered flying car to prove the Skycar is real and works. “I started making a paramotor on wheels that you sit on and take off and it suddenly occurred to me, ‘Why not just have a car that does everything?’” Cardozo said. His Wiltshire-based company Parajet built the paramotor that the adventurer Bear Grylls did fly near Everest in 2008. In 1998, Grylls, aged 23, became the youngest British to ascend Mount Everest. In May 2007, Grylls and Cardozo departed from Pheriche, about 32 kilometres south of Mount Everest.Cardozo has claimed he may finally have made it. “I’ve been dreaming about making flying cars since I was a boy, thinking about all the ways it could be done and seeing how all the other people in the world have done it wrong. No one’s ever made one that really does work that you can go out and buy. But here’s the ultimate solution: it’s cheap, it’s safe, it works, all the technology’s already there. So I pushed ahead and thought, ‘We’ve got to do it’,” he said.If the Skycar becomes successful, Cardozo’s company plans a limited production with a selling price of  £35,000 to £40,000 for a standard model and £60,000 for a high-performance sports version. “It will be a serious aircraft but also a proper road machine, with acceleration to match your average sports car,” says Cardozo. “I’m not going to sell millions of them but even if we sell 20 we’ll be laughing,” he added.The explorers, with the aid of sponsors, supporters and benefactor Sir Ranulph Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, 3rd Baronet OBE (known as 'Ranulph (Ran) Fiennes'), have aimed to raise more than £100,000 for some charities including an African orphanage.London, England — Yesterday, with less than a day before the start of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Paralympic cyclists spent time training at London's Olympic Park Velodrome.  Cycling on the track starts on Thursday.September 7, 2008 is the 1st major day of the 2008 Paralympic games, the below article summarises all the world records and medals.September 8, 2008 is the 2nd major day of the 2008 Paralympic games, the below article summaries all the highlights.Thirteen world records were broken by disability swimmers at this week's Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide, which also acts as the national selection trials for the forthcoming London Olympics and Paralympics. Seven of the records were in freestyle events, three in breaststroke, two in butterfly, and one in backstroke. The week also marked a changing of the guard in Australian swimming, with a handful of Olympic champions coming out of retirement, but with the exception of Libby Trickett, failing to qualify.Five swimmers set seven freestyle world records between them. Matthew Cowdrey broke the S9 50m and 100m records, with times of 25.66s and 55.20s respectively. In the 100m he was beaten by Daniel Fox who set a record in the S14 class with a time of 54.38s. The 50m race also saw a second record fall, with Mitchell Kilduff setting the new mark of 24.84s in the S14 class. Brenden Hall now holds the S9 400m record, with a winning time of 4:14.67. Jacqui Freney won the women's 100m in a time of 68.03s, an S8 record. Kayla Clarke took the 50m event in 28.66s, an S14 record.  In the other strokes, three swimmers set six world records between them. Blake Cochrane dominated the men's breaststroke, winning both the 50m and 100m, and setting records for his S8 class of 36.73s, and 79.06s. Tim Antalfy set S13 records in two disciplines, winning the 50m backstroke in 28.20s, then twice breaking the 100m butterfly record (55.31s in the preliminaries then 54.92s in the final), beating his nearest competitor by over six seconds. Prue Watt capped the record breaking run on the final night of competition, setting the women's S13 50m breaststroke mark at 36.27s.For national championships, disabled events are combined into "multi class" races which include competitors with a range of disabilities. They compete according to a point scoring system, with their performance measured against the world record for their classification. Thus not only have these swimmers qualified for London and written their names into the record books, they have also raised the bar for themselves in future competitions.In the able-bodied championships, all eyes were on the ex-champions attempting to return to the top level from retirement. Ian Thorpe, Michael Klim, and Geoff Huegill all missed qualification. Responding to their disappointments: Thorpe intends to continue swimming; Klim announced his retirement; and Huegill will discuss his options with his family. Libby Trickett scraped into the 4x100m relay team, placing fifth in the women's 100m final. A new generation will take national titles with them to their first Olympic competition.  James Magnussen will be a serious contender in two individual and two relay events, after winning both the 50m and 100m freestyle.  David McKeon won the 400m and 800m freestyle.  Thomas Fraser-Holmes took the 200m freestyle and 400m individual medley, and Daniel Tranter took the 200m medley.  Mitch Larkin secured the 200m backstroke title.  Chris Wright won the 50m and 100m butterfly.  Nick D'Arcy, winner of the 200m butterfly, now has a chance at Olympic redemption.  He was originally selected for Beijing, but was kicked off the team for assaulting a fellow team-member.  Three women have also booked their Olympic debut wearing the mantle of national champion.  Alice Tait won the 50m butterfly title.  Tessa Wallace won the women's 200m breaststroke, relegating  Leisel Jones, a former world record holder and world champion in the event, to fourth.  Leiston Pickett edged out Jones to take the 100m breaststroke title. Many of Australia's top performers from the Beijing Olympics have secured a place on the team heading to London.  Among the women, Stephanie Rice, Jessicah Schipper, Alicia Coutts, Emily Seebohm, Kylie Palmer, Bronte Barratt, Cate Campbell, Melissa Gorman, Belinda Hocking, and Melanie Schlanger all booked their trip with wins this week.  Although Jones missed out on Olympic selection in the 200m, second place in the 100m was enough to secure a berth to her fourth Olympic Games.In the men's events, Olympic silver medallists Brenton Rickard, Christian Sprenger, Hayden Stoeckel, Eamon Sullivan, and Matthew Targett will all get another shot at gold. Kenrick Monk missed out on the finals of the 200m freestyle in Beijing, but will contest the event again in London. Two national title winners did not qualify for the Olympics.  Jarrod Poort won the men's 1500m freestyle, but finished outside the Olympic qualifying time.  Benjamin Treffers won the mens 50m backstroke, which is not on the Olympic program.After the meet, Swimming Australia named the Olympic team.  Along with those mentioned above, the men on the team are Daniel Arnamnart, Tommaso D'Orsogna, Jayden Hadler, Matson Lawson, Cameron McEvoy, Ned McKendry, Ryan Napoleon, and James Roberts.  Completing the team for the women are Olympic newcomers Jessica Ashwood, Bronte Campbell (Cate's sister),  Brittany Elmslie, Blair Evans, Samantha Hamill, Yolane Kukla, and Jade Neilsen, and veterans Angie Bainbridge, Sally Foster and Meagen Nay.The Paralympic team has not yet been announced. Alongside the record-setters, favourites for Games selection include disability class winners Ellie Cole, Michael Anderson, Grant Patterson, Taylor Corry, Esther Overton, Maddison Elliott, Katherine Downie, Matthew Levy, Rick Pendleton, Amanda Fowler, and Sarah Rose.  Ahmed Kelly, abandoned as a baby with severe deformities in an Iraqi orphanage, and rescued by an Australian charity, qualified in the 50m breaststroke.The eight day meet was held during the period March 15-22 at the SA Aquatic and Leisure Centre, in Oakland's Park, South Australia.  It was run by Swimming Australia, with Energy Australia as the principal sponsor.London, England — With the table tennis event taking place in the ExCeL North Arena 1, Poland's Piotr Grudzien beat Slovakia's Richard Csejtey in Group A of the men's singles Paralympics competition early yesterday by three sets to one. The first set lasted 28 minutes, ending in a win for Csejtey at 9–11; Grudzien came back to win the next three sets with scores of 12–10, 12–10, and 11–8. None of the four sets took over six minutes.Grudzien was on his toes most of the match, moving around the table, touching the left-hand corner on his side of the net after every point. The pair had contrasting experiences in their first round matches; Grudzien lost in straight sets to Iraq's Saeed Ali whereas Csejtey won all his sets against Ali.Twenty-year old Grudzien came into the Games as the defending silver medalist aiming to take home another medal.  Playing for ZSR Start Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, his left arm is shorter than his right and his right leg shorter than his left. Grudzien's next scheduled match is the Men's Team Class 6–8 First Round on Wednesday when Poland faces Ukraine.The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has confirmed the ban on all Russian athletes from the games in the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio today."The Russian Paralympic Committee will not be able to enter athletes into the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games", IPC President Sir Philip Craven told a Rio de Janeiro press conference today. "It is our responsibility to ensure fair competition. That is vital to the integrity and credibility of Paralympic sport. I believe the Russian government has catastrophically failed its athletes. The medals over morals attitude disgusts me." The international committee considered arguments from the Russian committee before confirming the ban.This comes after the publication of the McLaren report, which described state-sponsored doping in the Russian team. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has also claimed the doping cover-up operation was sponsored by the state, with samples destroyed to eliminate evidence of doping. Drug test laboratory director turned whistleblower Dr Rodchenkov acknowledged the state security forces — in the words of the WADA report — "actively imposed an atmosphere of intimidation on laboratory process and staff". He also claimed he was part of state-organised doping at the Sochi Winter Olympics, destroying urine samples and giving athletes banned drugs.Russia has denied these allegations, Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko calling WADA's doping report, when it first came out, "unverified sources, on unverified facts".  According to Russian news agency Tass, Mutko said Russia would appeal today's IPC ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Russian gold medal winner Yuriy Borzakovskiy expressed scepticism of the allegations, saying "The report itself contains a lot of allegations but not many facts [...] The pressure [to expel Russia from the Olympics] is very much political".London, England —  This morning, Great Britain beat Turkey in the 7th–8th place classification match in 5-a-side football by a score of 2–0 at London's Riverbank Arena.  Following the match, Great Britain's 41-year-old captain David Clarke retired from the sport with a national team career that included 128 goals scored in 144 caps.On Sunday French capital football club Paris Saint Germain announced they signed two players — Polish defensive midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak from Spanish club Sevilla FC on a five-year term and Belgian defender Thomas Meunier from Club Brugge KV on a four year deal, under the management of Unai Emery. Defensive midfielder Kychowiak spent two seasons with Sevilla with Unai Emery playing 90 matches and won two back-to-back UEFA Europa League titles. He has played 38 international matches and played in the UEFA Euro 2016 quarter-finals where his team lost to Portugal on penalties.After signing the contract agreement, Krychowiak said, "I am very proud to return to France and defend the colours of a club as ambitious as Paris Saint-Germain[...] The opportunity to continue working with Unai Emery was obviously a major factor in my decision." ((fr))French language: ‍C’est un sentiment de grande fierté qui m’anime à l’heure de revenir en France pour y porter le maillot d’un club aussi ambitieux que le Paris Saint-Germain[...] Continuer de travailler avec Unai Emery a évidemment compté dans mon choix. Kychowiak played for Stade de Reims before joining Sevilla.24-year-old defender Thomas Meunier played five years at Club Brugge and won the Belgian Pro League this season and Belgian Cup in 2015. Meunier was trained as a forward. Making his international debut in 2013, Meunier played with the national team in UEFA Euro 2016.Meunier said, "I feel I am ready for the next step after five beautiful years in Brugge. PSG is a team that is well-know all over the world and I am proud to be transferred to such a big team. I want to thank everyone in Brugge for my beautiful time here: the fans, the players, the staff and the board" ((fr))French language: ‍Après cinq belles années passées à Bruges, je me sens prêt pour franchir une étape. Le PSG est une équipe qui possède une réputation mondiale et je suis fier de pouvoir m'inscrire dans la lignée des joueurs du Club qui font le pas vers de grandes formations. Je veux remercier tout le monde à Bruges, des supporters aux joueurs, le staf, la direction, pour ces bons moments vécus à Bruges !.PSG previously signed French midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa.File:FK Partizan.pngFK Partizan of Serbia have been kicked out of this season's UEFA Cup after crowd trouble during their first qualifying round match against Zrinjski Mostar. They were also fined 50,000 Swiss francs. Partizan Belgrade won the 1st Leg 6-1.Trouble started early in the first half when play was stopped for ten minutes after fans from both teams clashed with riot police and stadium security while throwing rocks and flares at each other. Fans also ripped-up stadium seats. 36 people were injured and six people were arrested.UEFA's reasoning is that Partizan Belgrade have been fined 25 times in 36 matches over the last five years. UEFA have taken a tougher stance on fan violence having kicked out Feyenoord in last season's UEFA Cup and Legia Warsaw in this season's Intertoto Cup. Partizan Belgrade have within three days of receiving official notice of this decision to appeal.After an away victory of 1:3 over Vojvodina, Partizan increased its advantage over second place Red Star by 7 points in the First Federal League. Red Star shared points with Smederevo by tieing 1:1 at home with the 12th place team.Another surpise of the round was the easy victory of Obilić over Budućnost, with a score of 4:2 (3:1 at half time), which put Obilić into 13th place, and allowed Zemun to take over the 5th spot from Budućnost. Obilić now has a chance to finish in the top 12, which would secure their existence in the first league, as they are behind Hajduk, Borac and Smederevo by a goal difference only and have a deficit of one played game. All results from this round are:Borac - Hajduk Bgd. 2:0 (0:0)Zeta - Čukarički St. 2:0 (1:0)Zemun - Sutjeska 1:0 (1:0)Vojvodina - Partizan 1:3 (0:0)OFK Beograd - Hajduk R. 4:1 (3:0)Red Star - Smederevo 1:1 (0:0)Železnik - Radnički JP 3:3 (1:2)Obilić - Budućnost 4:2 (3:1)In a comeback after two years of inactivity due to stress fractures and becoming a mother, world record holder Paula Radcliffe from the United Kingdom has won the New York City marathon today. After leading the women's race almost all the way, she managed to shake off Ethiopian Gete Wami, who challenged her in the last mile. Third finished winner of previous two New York City marathons Jelena Prokopcuka from Latvia. The men's race was also a duel, but Martin Lel from Kenya managed to repeat his victory over Abderrahim Goumri from Morocco from the London marathon last April.Radcliffe, 33, said that she had to think of her baby to keep up her pace: "I just kept repeating to myself 'I love you Isla' to keep my rhythm going." The elite runner has now won all seven marathons she has competed in, and has qualified for the upcoming Beijing Olympics of 2008, where she will try to rectify the forfeit from the 2004 summer Olympics in Athens.Wami, who had just successfully defended her title in the Berlin marathon five weeks ago, still managed to take home the US$500,000 prize for winning the World Marathon Majors, a contest that spanned major races over the last two years (New York City, Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin).In an interview just after finishing, Radcliffe expressed her grief over Ryan Shay, who died yesterday during the U.S. men's marathon trials in Central Park, by calling it "a tragedy, and it puts everything into perspective." Apparently Shay had a preexistent large heart, and died from a massive heart attack.Yesterday, Peru defeated Paraguay 2–0 in the third place playoff of the 2015 Copa América ((en))Spanish language: ‍America Cup, which was held in Estadio Municipal de Concepción stadium in Concepción city of Chile, and won a bronze medal.Peru had 50.9% possession of the ball in front of Paraguay. Peru completed 408 passes whereas Paraguay completed 407. The passing accuracy of both teams were almost same with 78.9 to 79.6% accuracy.

In the 89th minute of the match, Guerrero scored a close range goal which sealed the third place for Los Incas. By this goal, Guerrero netted 4 goals for the tournament to equal with Chile's Eduardo Vargas. This is back-to-back third place for Peru in the Copa tournament.In Friday's National Hockey League contest between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Boston Bruins at the TD Banknorth Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Peter Forsberg almost netted his first "hat trick" in a Flyers uniform.  At one point during the game, he had been given credit for three goals, however an official review took his first goal away, and officially he scored his eighth goal of the season at 13:06 in the second period with assists from Simon Gagne and former Hartford Whaler Sami Kapanen.To date, there have been 24 hat tricks (3 or more goals in one game) in this NHL season.Forsberg, a 32 year old native of Sweden, recently joined the Flyers for the 2005-2006 season after spending the NHL lockout season with Modo, Sweden.  The Flyers ended up winning the game 5-3, adding yet another loss to an already disappointing Bruins season.Darren Ferguson resigned yesterday as the manager of Peterborough United Football Club. His departure comes after a 3–0 defeat yesterday to MK Dons. Peterborough United are currently in fifteenth position of League One, the third tier of English football. Peterborough United's chairman, Darragh MacAnthony, released a statement on the club's website regarding the resignation.

After Speaking with Darren, he feels that a new challenge is needed for both himself and the football club."MacAnthony also spoke about the club's current performance. He said "I’m personally very disappointed in our current league position, the performances from our playing squad and the fact that we have dropped way below our own standards that we set out at as a football club."Ferguson has managed Peterborough United twice. He had previously led the team from 2007 to 2009. Over his two tenures he has twice led the team to the Championship, the second tier of English football.With Ferguson's resignation five other coaches and officials have left the club. Dave Robertson, the academy manger, has been put in caretaker charge and is to lead the club until a replacement manager has been found.Darren Ferguson is the son of former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.On Friday, Arsenal F.C. goalkeeper and Czech Republic football captain Petr Čech announced retirement from international football. Debuting fourteen years ago, Čech made 124 international appearances and became his nation's most capped player. The 34-year-old goalkeeper said, "This is a purely football-based decision. [...] I'm now 34 and the next [international] tournament is in two years which, in football, is a very long time."Čech said his childhood dream was to play a match in the national jersey.

Phil died from complications from Parkinson's Disease. He was set to travel to a historic meeting at Monterey but was rushed to hospital. His son Derek, also a racecar driver had to retire to look after his father. Phil was the first American-born driver to win the Formula One World Drivers' Championship when he won the 1961 season. Italian-born American Mario Andretti, who won the Drivers' Championship in 1978, is the only other American to have won.Phil Hill finished one point above the German Wolfgang von Trips, who died in a crash during the Italian Grand Prix.As well as winning the 1961 F1 Season, Phil also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans three times in 1958, 1961 and 1962.He continued to race up until 1966 when he retired. He failed to win another F1 race after the 1961 season. After retiring from racing he spent his time collecting vintage cars. He judged at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance a record 38 times."It's a sad day," said close friend Carroll Shelby. "Phil was an excellent race car driver with a unique feel for the car, and his real expertise was in long-distance racing."Yesterday in Augusta, Georgia at Augusta National Golf Club, American Phil Mickelson won the 70th Masters with a final round score of 69 and a four round total score of 281, seven under par and two strokes better than South African Tim Clark, the sole second place finisher. This was Mickelson's second consecutive major as well as his second green jacket. In a five-way tie for third place at four under par were José María Olazábal, Retief Goosen, Tiger Woods, Chad Campbell, and Fred Couples. Rounding out the top ten were eighth place finishers Angel Cabrera and Vijay Singh followed by Stewart Cink in tenth place.Although Mickelson had to fire up during the last few holes to take the '04 Masters over Ernie Els, nothing of that sort was required during Sunday's round. He parred the first six holes before making two straight birdies at 7 and 8, and then went on to make two more at 13 and 15 before finishing off with a bogey at 18. Last year, Mickelson put Tiger's jacket on for him. This year, Tiger helped Phil into the jacket. "I certainly enjoyed having the jacket put on me," Mickelson said. "I love the chance to compete against guys like Tiger, guys like Retief and Ernie and Vijay and Fred who are playing so well. It gives me an incredible feeling of accomplishment to be able to come out on top this week." After 42 straight misses at majors, Mickelson is now on track with one major per year for the past three years. Playing partner Fred Couples nearly got within one stroke of Mickelson but went on to miss the birdie putt and another par putt to sink out of contention. Putting was also Tiger Woods's major hindrance. He made three three-putts and had an overall total of 33 putts with a final round of 70. Afterwards, Woods remarked, "It was frustrating. I felt in control of my golf swing from tee to green. Once I got on the green, I was a spaz. I didn't have it all day - even this morning (in the third round) I didn't putt well." Clark capped off a great run and a final round 69 with a chip-in from the sand at 18 for a birdie. Clark moved to number 15 on the Official World Golf Rankings, Woods stayed at number 1, Couples moved to 21st, and Mickelson moved up to 2nd.The Montreal Canadiens lost to the Philadelphia Flyers, 3–2, in the only game  played in the National Hockey League on April 28, 2008. Scottie Upshall opened the scoring in the middle of the second period, scoring an even-strength goal at 7:04 of the period. Mike Richards made the score 2–0 with a shorthanded goal at 15:12 of the same period. Before the period ended, R.J. Umberger made the score 3–0 at 18:19. Montreal would comeback within one goal of tying the game in the third, as Tomas Plekanec and Saku Koivu scored powerplay goals at 7:29 and 8:41 of the third period, respectively. Montreal badly outshot Philadelphia, 34–14. Martin Biron stopped 32 shots, while his counterparts Carey Price and Jaroslav Halak, stopped  9 out of 12 shots, and 2 out 2 shots respectively. Halak started the third period after Price gave up three goals on 12 shots. Philadelphia now leads the series, 2–1.When you mix a shopping cart, six team members, bar hopping and bonus points for schmoozing bar hostesses and sabotaging your enemies, you get the annual Washington, D.C. Idiotarod race.  On Saturday, this bizarre fund raising event, which originated in San Francisco 13 years ago, pitted teams of "sleds" together to race from bar to bar in Washington, D.C.'s fashionable Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan neighborhoods.  Each "sled" consists of a "borrowed" shopping cart and six human dogs to pull the cart.  Points are given for originality, the best time and best sabotage of another sled.The race is held to benefit the Arlington Food Assistance Center and is organized by Ellen Shortill and Kristen Heatherly.  Their organization, called "SMASHED" or "Society for Mature Adults Seeking to Help, Entertain and Donate", takes the position that donating small amounts many times ultimately benefits the smaller charities.  Said Shortill, "Our goal is simply to have fun and raise money for those charities that don't really get any attention."  The race this year consisted of 22 teams.  Although team "Save NOLA" got to the last bar first, teams can win bonus points for (among other things) flirting with bar hosts and hostesses at any of the five bars along the route.  The route is approximately 3 miles long, and each team is required to spend at least 20 minutes in each bar.  Heatherly noted that "it doesn't matter who got here first, ultimately its the team with the most credits and the best time that wins."  Unique among the participants are brothers Pete and Chris Magnuson who are attempting to get on the 10th edition of Amazing Race on CBS.  Their team called "Pick Pete and Chris" ran through the streets with t-shirts hawking their website and their fervent desire to be chosen for the next edition of the television show."Its not really about who wins, its that we get to have a blast and raise some money," said Shortill.  The charity event raised about $500 and various canned goods for the food pantry.On Friday, the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in game seven of the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals to win their third Stanley Cup. Max Talbot scored all of the Penguins goals to give them a 2-1 win over the Red Wings.  In winning the cup, the Penguins became the first team in 38 years to win a Stanley Cup Finals game seven while playing on the road. Pittsburgh last won the Stanley Cup in 1992.This Stanley Cup run was not an easy one for the Penguins.  In the opening round of the playoffs, the Penguins took six games to defeat in-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers.  The second round series against the Washington Capitals featured a highly-touted individual matchup, as the Penguins young star Sidney Crosby matched skills against Alexander Ovechkin of the Capitals; it took the Penguins all seven games to win that series. The Penguins rolled the Carolina Hurricanes in a four game sweep to win the Eastern Conference title.  In the Finals, they found themselves down three games to two against the Red Wings, a dynasty which has won four Cups in the past 12 seasons, and was the defending champion.The Penguins win in game seven was not only due to the scoring of Max Talbot; Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury allowed only one goal on 25 shots.  The Penguins young star, Sidney Crosby had little impact on this game; though he was the second highest scorer of the entire playoffs, a hip injury in the second period kept him out of half of the game.  After a scoreless first period, Pittsburgh's Max Talbot scored on an assist from Evgeni Malkin only 1:13 into the second period.  Talbot added to his first goal with a second at the 10:07 mark in the second period, on assists from Chris Kunitz and Rob Scuderi.  The final score came in the third period, at 13:53, as Jonathan Ericsson scored Detroit's only goal of the game, on assists from Nicklas Lidström and Jiri Hudler.The game featured five minor penalties; two by Detroit and three by Pittsburgh; all were inconsequential as all three goals were scored at full-strength.In Monday night Major League Baseball action, the Pittsburgh Pirates won a victory over the Colorado Rockies in Denver, 5-2.

Early reports indicate he has broken his nose and jaw, but the full extent of his injuries remain unknown. Roethlisberger has already undergone surgery for his nose and mouth.  He was riding without a helmet on Second Avenue near the intersection of 10th Street in downtown Pittsburgh when he collided with a silver Chrysler New Yorker, reportedly striking the windshield with his head.Backup quarterback Charlie Batch was at the emergency room at Mercy Hospital today, but was unavailable for comment.  Steelers head coach Bill Cowher has talked to Ben in the past about riding without a helmet, and retired Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw has spoken out strongly against the habit of riding without a helmet in the past.A press conference held around 10:30 p.m. confirmed that Roethlisberger successfully underwent seven hours of surgery, and suffered no serious injuries in the initial accident apart from the broken nose and jaw. Initial reports of knee injuries were overstated. Actual knee injuries were limited to road rash, and do not extend to joint injuries.On Tuesday, NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was upgraded to fair condition at Pittsburgh's Mercy Hospital.

Police confirmed that Roethlisberger was riding without a helmet and additionally, did not have a Pennsylvania motorcycle license; he had a learner's permit, which expired March 29, 2006.  Given this fact, Roethlisberger was in fact legally obligated to wear a helmet in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.Steelers officials and Roethlisberger's agent, Leigh Steinberg, confirmed that Ben had received a letter last year from team representatives warning him that parts of his contract might be affected if he were to be injured while riding a motorcycle.  The letter was apparently sent in order to both put the team on solid legal footing were a major accident to occur, and apprise Ben of the risks he is taking by riding a motorcycle.Records kept by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation indicate that 180 helmet-wearing motorcyclists died in wrecks in 2004 and 2005 in Pennsylvania. In the same period, 157 helmet-free bikers died in wrecks.Jerome Bettis, who announced his retirement from the Pittsburgh Steelers on the night they won the Super Bowl XL in Detroit, has been tapped as a studio analyst at NBC.

As a result, only casinos can host poker tournaments in Switzerland.  Private games with friends, even where money is at stake, are still permitted under the ruling.Poker tournaments had been growing in popularity in the country, with many events held in hotels and bars.  Such venues do not have to pay the 50% tax on profits levied on licensed casinos, nor comply with regulations combating money laundering and gambling addiction.  Poker is now categorised alongside roulette and slot machines, which as games of luck can only be played inside casinos.  Mathematics, strategy, and bluffing were less important in determining the result than chance, said the judges, overturning a lower court ruling to the opposite effect, and disagreeing with the stance of the country's Federal Gaming Commission.  Before the ruling, it had been estimated by the Swiss Federation of Casinos that there were about 100 unlicensed poker tournaments every weekend. A Swiss poker website, SwissPokerTour.ch, has described the result as "a black day for all amateur poker players in Switzerland."The Polish Olympic Committee (PKOL) announced today the list of 258 sportsmen drafted to represent Poland at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, China.

The Committee spent over PLN186 million (almost US$90 million) on preparations for the Olympics in last four years, with PLN73 million of it spent this year alone.

It is a violation of the Olympic Oath. It means that the IOC may even expel one from the Village and take away the medals.  I have talked a lot about it with our sportsmen. They have answered that politics is not interesting for them in Beijing.  They are concentrating on sports." It will be the third biggest Polish Olympic team in history; there were more sportsmen at the Olympics in 1972 (Munich, 288) and 1980 (Moscow, 321). Fours years ago the team numbered 202 sportsmen.

Eight people have been arrested in connection to this ring, and up to 24 people are individuals of interest to federal agents and may be arrested before the investigation is over.According to records seized during the raids, customers of the pharmacies included Holyfield, Matthews, former baseball star Jose Canseco, and former pitcher Jason Grimsley. Investigators reportedly have found evidence that performance-enhancing drugs were prescribed to a number of professional athletes as well as international bodybuilders. Further evidence showed that Dr. Richard Rydze, team doctor of the Pittsburgh Steelers, purchased $150,000 worth of human growth hormone on his personal credit card. Calls to Dr. Rydze were not immediately returned.Those arrested include Stan and Naomi Loomis, owners of Signature Pharmacy in Orlando, Florida. Two other employees of the pharmacy (including Loomis's brother, Mike) were arrested as well. P. David Soares, Albany County prosecutor, indicated in filings from his office that Signature is believed to be a "producer" of anabolic steroids. Grimsley and Rydze were reported to be customers of Signature Pharmacy. Holyfield, Matthews, and Canseco were allegedly on customer lists from Applied Pharmacy Services in Mobile, Alabama. Both pharmacies and their owners are implicated in the steroid ring.According to SI.com, Matthews received shipments of Genotropin, a synthetic growth hormone. The shipments were sent to the address of one of his former minor-league teammates in Mansfield, Texas. Matthews claimed he did not know why his name was on Applied Pharmacy's customer list. He did not comment further on the situation, stating that he was not "in a position to answer specific questions."On Wednesday, Holyfield indicated that he was "not overly concerned about the situation." He did mention that the only purchase of medical supplies that can be attributed to him were medications for his father, who died of a heart ailment in January. Later that evening, Holyfield released a more pointed denial, stating, "I do not use steroids. I have never used steroids. I resent that my name has been linked to known steroid users by sources who refuse to be identified in order to generate publicity for their investigation."Professional cyclist Matt Decanio was fired in January from the Ofoto/Sierra Nevada cycling team for breaking what the team spokesman Josh Kadis called "ground rules" about what materials Decanio would be permitted to post on his anti-doping website, according to a report by VeloNews.

Organisers claim these nations of controlling cricket's governance to benefit themselves.Sam Collins and Jarrod Kimber, a pair of journalists and film-makers, organised the protest."Now the Ashes have been decided, we feel the time is right to protest at the powerlessness of all other countries in the cricket world," Collins told The Telegraph. "Nobody has any power except for Narayan Srinivasan, of India, Giles Clarke, of England, and Wally Edwards, of Australia."Collins and Kimber recently released the film Death of a Gentleman. The documentary was created by the pair to examine what the future holds for test match cricket whilst examining claims of corrupt administrators. The film-makers have launched changecricket.com, calling on cricket fans to advocate for better governance of the sport. "We ask fans of all nations to stand with us and show their dissatisfaction about the way their game is being run," said Collins.Around 25 arrests have been made by Metropolitan Police officers, during the 31 mile Olympic Torch relay in London, England.The torch relay began at Wembley Stadium where protesters waved flags and chanted as the torch started on its route.

The W-League is Australia's premier women's football competition.Queensland finished the regular season as premiers. They hosted Sydney FC at Ballymore in the semi final, winning 5-4 on penalties. Canberra finished third and traveled to EnergyAustralia Stadium in New South Wales to play the Newcastle Jets.Queensland went ahead after 6 minutes with a goal to striker Lanna Harch. Midfielder Tameka Butt doubled the advantage 17 minutes later.In a desperate attempt to get back in the game, Canberra played three players at the back after half time. This strategy worked well in the opening stages of the second half, but failed to result in any goals for United. Canberra were denied a goal early in the half after substitute Ashleigh Sykes was ruled offside."It was a really pleasing performance," said Roar coach Jeff Hopkins. "We were under a little bit of pressure coming in as premiers and perhaps being expected to win the game, but it just shows the quality and character that we have in the squad that the players performed under a lot of pressure.""It's just a dream, especially because it's the inaugural year, just to be in the right spot at the right time and finish it off was really good," Harch, who claimed player of the match honours, told ABC1, "It was definitely a tight clash, Canberra came to play and it was a hard match."Bayern Munich hosted Real Madrid at the Allianz Arena today in the second leg of the Champions League round of sixteen.  The first leg saw Real coming out on top 3-2, but the two away goals by Bayern gave them a good chance in the second leg.  Madrid were without David Beckham for the game, who orchestrated all 3 goals in the first leg, and he was replaced in the midfield by Raúl.  Bayern played a strong side, with Lucas Podolski and Roy Makaay in attack, and Owen Hargreaves in the midfield.Any plans Real had made for the game went immediately out the window when Roy Makaay scored the fastest ever goal in a Champions League match after only 10 seconds.  Real took the kickoff, and Roberto Carlos was immediately dispossessed by Salihamidzic, who passed in the ball to Makaay.  The German striker neatly finished passed Iker Casillas to stun the Galacticos, and give the home side the lead.  Bayern continued to press, and Real looked listless, as shots from Podolski and Makaay were saved by Casillas.  Real coach Fabio Capello was quick to make changes in his team, and sent on Guti in place of Emerson.  Casillas was again forced into action as van Buyten headed Sagnol's free kick towards the goal, but the keeper got down well to make the stop.  Madrid finally began to play like a team, and substitute Guti had a chance after a neat backheel by Higuain found him, but the shot flew wide.  Real continued pressing, and Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy headed a ball towards the net, but Oliver Kahn was easily able to cope with the low power effort.  Raúl then struck an acrobatic effort towards the goal, but found only the side netting.After the restart, Real looked shaky at the back again as van Bommel found his way in on goal, but Casillas was again on hand to snuff out the danger.  Oliver Kahn was then forced into action at the other end, as he pushed out a van Nistelrooy header off of a cross by Raúl.  Bayern had a penalty claim, but were denied by referee Lubos Michel.  It didn't matter however, and the resulting corner was met by Lucio's head, doubling Bayerns lead.  Bayern had another chance minutes later, but a open header by Salihamidzic went wide.  Raúl then had a chance for Real, but his header was directed straight to Kahn.  Ruud van Nistelrooy was then denied a run on goal after a mistaken offside call was given by the linesman.  On 80 minutes, Robinho was hauled down by van Bommel in the penalty area, and Real was awarded a penalty.  Marco van Bommel was consequently given his second yellow of the match for arguing the point, and was sent off along with Diarra of Real for his part in the confrontation.  Once everything settled, van Nistelrooy stepped up to the spot and sent the ball into the net, cutting the lead in half, but still leaving Real behind on aggregate.  The game finished dramatically, as Ramos thought he had scored to tie the game, but the referee correctly judged that a hand had been used in the build up, and the goal was not counted.  The game ended in a win for Bayern, and they will go on to the next round, while Real is left to focus on domestic play.For the second time in two days, the sun and the crowds came out to welcome the Tour de France to London.The all clapping, all cheering public lined the streets to watch David Millar take the lead from Greenwich, only to lose his steam 50km to the end.

En vanaf vandaag zal ik de eerste supporter zijn.Nainggolan announced his decision soon after Roberto Martinez, Belgium team manager, shortlisted 28 players for the Russia World Cup. Martinez travelled to Rome to inform Nainggolan about his decision before announcing the shortlisted players. Nainggolan, who turned 30 earlier this month, scored two goals for AS Roma against English club Liverpool FC in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final. In 2017, Roma club supporters voted Nainggolan the club's Player of the Season.Explaining his decision to leave out Nainggolan, manager Martinez said, "It was a sad and difficult decision. He is a player with a lot of class and he was voted Roma's best player, but I've made my decision for purely tactical reasons." The Spaniard added, "We know that Radja has a very important role in his club and we cannot give him that role in our squad".Martinez is to finalise and submit a 23-man squad for the World Cup tournament on June 4, after his team plays against Portugal in a friendly scheduled for June 2 in the Belgian capital Brussels. After Nainggolan was left out of the squad, former Belgian international Philippe Albert said, "We must be the only country in the world to be making the trip without one of the best players in the world".Belgium is in Group G for the World Cup, along with England, Panama, and Tunisia. Belgium is currently world number three in the FIFA rankings.On Monday, Spanish football club Real Madrid sacked their manager Rafael Benítez. They appointed Zinedine Zidane as his successor.Real Madrid, who failed to win a trophy last season under their Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti, hired former Liverpool manager Benítez as Ancelotti's replacement for the 2015–16 season. Benítez had previously won the UEFA Champions League with Liverpool F.C., the UEFA Super Cup with Valencia C.F., and the UEFA Europa League with London-based club Chelsea F.C. However he was heavily criticised after a 4–0 defeat by Barcelona in the El Clásico at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and a shock exit from the 2015–16 Copa del Rey for including an ineligible player in the squad, Russian Denis Cheryshev.Having won only seventeen out of 25 matches with Los Blancos, Benítez's last match for Real Madrid ended in a 2–2 draw to Valencia in an away match on Sunday; they are third in the La Liga table, four points behind league leaders and local rivals Atlético Madrid.Zinedine Zidane is a former Real Madrid legend and coach of Real's reserve team, Real Madrid Castilla. Real's president Florentino Pérez appointed the Frenchman and said Zidane "knows better than anyone just what it means to lead the Real Madrid first-team squad."Real Madrid has had eleven managers in the twelve years that Pérez has been president. Zidane, expressing his gratitude to Pérez, said "I'm going to put my heart and soul into this club".Zidane was assistant manager to Ancelotti when Real Madrid won their tenth European Championship. Back in 2001, Real Madrid paid Turin-based club Juventus F.C. the equivalent of £45.8 million to sign Zidane. Pérez said to Zidane, "This is your stadium and your club and you have all our confidence and trust to make the fans excited once more. It makes me proud because I know that for you the word impossible does not exist."Rafael Nadal, the 2008 Men's Singles winner at the Wimbledon Championships, announced today his withdrawal from the 2009 Championships because of a knee injury caused by his tendinitis.  The formal announcement came after he had played the second of his warm-up matches.On Thursday, whilst playing Lleyton Hewitt, Nadal had experienced issues with moving about the court.  Again, whilst playing Stanislas Wawrinka today, he had problems and lost the match.He will be the first champion to not defend his Wimbledon championship since Goran Ivanišević pulled out in 2002.As a result, fifth seed Juan Martín del Potro takes Nadal's place in the first quarter of the draw, seventeenth seed James Blake takes del Potro's place in the fifth quarter, Nicolas Kiefer becomes the thirty-third seed and takes Blake's place in the fourth quarter, with his own previous spot now filled by lucky loser Thiago Alves.Björn Borg was quoted on Tuesday (June 16) as saying "Nadal is always a dangerous player because he is the best in the world — but what happened in Paris and then the injury, I am picking Andy Murray or Roger Federer. […] For Nadal to win five in a row (at the French Open) was a big goal this year. I am sure he was very, very disappointed when he went home after Paris. That defeat took him many, many days to get over. Nadal is saying he has got an injury, but he has to be fit at Wimbledon if he wants to go all the way, and I do not think he will go all the way this year."Baltimore Orioles first baseman Rafael Palmeiro, one of only four players in the history of Major League Baseball to amass 500 home runs and 3000 hits, has been suspended for 10 days by MLB for a first violation of its new steroids policy. Palmeiro is the seventh, and by far the highest-profile player, who tested positive for steroids since MLB instituted its new steroids policy in 2005. In a conference call with reporters, he did not deny testing positive for performance enhancement drugs, but insisted that he had accidentally ingested them, and left the impression that the steroids were in a supplement that he had used.On March 17, 2005, Palmeiro had testified before a U.S. House hearing on steroids use in sports, opening his testimony by saying: "Let me start by telling you this: I have never used steroids. Period. I don't know how to say it any more clearly than that. Never." Earlier in 2005, Palmeiro had been named as a steroid user by former major-league star José Canseco in his tell-all autobiography.It remains to be seen how Palmeiro's positive test will affect his future election to the Hall of Fame. His statistics would normally make him a likely Hall candidate once he becomes eligible for election, five years after retirement. It is also possible that Palmeiro could face perjury charges for lying before Congress, but only if it could be proved that he had used steroids before his Congressional testimony.Despite the intervention in parts of Crimea, Ukraine by forces connected to Russia in the past few days, the rail border between the countries remains open today.

Real Madrid via their official website said Courtois "has signed for the club for the next six seasons."26-year-old Courtois has been Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper for the last four seasons. He joined The Blues in 2011 from Belgian club K.R.C. Genk. In the last four seasons at Chelsea, Courtois won Premier League titles in 2014–15 and 2016–17, an EFL Cup in 2014–15, and the FA Cup in the last season. In his 2016–17 season for Chelsea, the Belgian kept sixteen clean-sheets in league matches.Just after joining Chelsea in 2011, Courtois was loaned to Real Madrid's cross-town rivals Atlético Madrid. During this previous spell in Spain, Courtois won one each of the Spanish LaLiga, Copa del Rey, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Super Cup. Courtois won the Adidas Golden Glove in this year's FIFA World Cup in Russia, winning the third-place medal with Belgium.According to report by ESPN, Real Madrid had to pay about £35 million for the transfer. At the same time, Real Madrid's midfielder Mateo Kovačić is loaned to Chelsea for the next season. In Real Madrid's official announcement, they said Courtois is to be presented at Santiago Bernabeu today at 1 pm after his medical examination.Madrid, Spain — On Wednesday night, Spanish La Liga football team Real Madrid defeated Celta Vigo 4–0 in Copa del Rey octofinals in a return match played at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.Real Madrid lost the first leg of the round at an away match against Celta Vigo 1–2 and needed to win this game by a score of 1–0 to advance.  Their 4–0 victory gave them an aggregate score of 5–2 which allowed them to advance in Copa del Rey.  They were led in scoring by Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo who scored a hat trick, with goals in the second, twenty-fourth, and eighty-seventh minutes. Ronaldo had been a heavy favourite to win FIFA's Ballon d'Or earlier in the week but was beaten by fellow La Liga rival Lionel Messi, who Real Madrid fans booed during the game.  Ronaldo would have scored a fourth goal but the one he scored in the thirty-seventh minute was made while he was in a position controversially ruled offside. Sami Khedira scored Real Madrid's fourth and final goal in the eighty-ninth minute.Real Madrid spent part of the game down a player after Sergio Ramos received his second yellow card in the seventy-third minute and was sent off the pitch.In other octofinal matches played on Wednesday, Sevilla lost to Mallorca 1–2 but defeated them 6–2 on aggregate to advance while Zaragoza defeated Levante  2–0 to advance with a 3–0 aggregate score.Last night in La Liga play, Real Madrid defeated Sevilla 4–1 in a game played at Real Madrid's home ground.  Ronaldo scored a hat trick in Madrid's victory.After last year's victory against crosstown rivals Atlético Madrid at San Siro in Milan, Spanish capital football club Real Madrid defeated Italian giants Juventus FC 4–1 in the UEFA Champions League final in Cardiff, Wales on Saturday.Cristiano Ronaldo scored the first goal of the match from Dani Carvajal's pass in the 20th minute becoming the first player to score in three Champions League finals. This marked the 500th goal in the European Championship for Real Madrid. Not much later, Mario Mandžukić scored a goal from an overhead kick in the 27th minute from former Real Madrid forward Gonzalo Higuaín. Three players were booked in the first half — Juve's Paulo Dybala, Real Madrid's captain Sergio Ramos and Dani Carvajal as the first half ended 1–1.Just after the one hour mark, Casemiro made it 2–1 as his right footed shot deflecting off Sami Khedira found the net, and three minutes later, Ronaldo netted his 600th career goal from Luka Modrić's cross from just six yards in front of the goal. Juan Cuadrado, who was substituted after the scoreline was 1–3, was booked twice in the span of eleven minutes, in the 72nd and 83rd minutes, making the situation harder for trailing Juventus. The ten-men Juve had seven minutes plus injury time to minimise the damage. But, a 90th minute goal by Marco Asensio ensured the game ended without going into extra time like last year's final. Asensio was shown a yellow card for his celebration.Real Madrid, under Zinedine Zidane, secured their twelfth European title; their sixth Champions League trophy after the tournament's rebranding, becoming the first club to win consecutive Champions League titles. They also won the La Liga title this season. Juve's goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon,  missed out on what would have been his first Champions League title. Juventus missed their second chance to win a treble, previously denied by FC Barcelona two years ago.Ronaldo is to face his former club Manchester United and his former manager at Real Madrid in 2012, José Mourinho in the UEFA Super Cup in Macedonia, scheduled for August 8. Ronaldo has now won four Champions League titles — three with Los Blancos and one with Manchester — and finished as the Champions League top scorer netting twelve goals this season ahead of Lionel Messi. For the last four years, Spanish clubs have won four European Championship in a row, Real Madrid and Barcelona, more than any other European country.On Wednesday, Spanish football club Real Madrid C.F. narrowly beat English club Manchester City 1–0 in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid.The first leg, played on April 26 at the Manchester Stadium in Manchester, ended 0–0. This was Manchester City's first ever appearance at the semi-final stage of the competition. Real Madrid reached the semi-final stage for the 27th time in their history, and have taken part in more semi-finals than any other side. Manchester City held firm in the opening minutes, but City captain Vincent Kompany was substituted after going down with an injury, and Real went ahead ten minutes later when Gareth Bale's cross deflected off City's Brazilian midfielder Fernando, and past keeper Joe Hart in the 20th minute for an own goal. Both teams had shots that hit the woodwork during the game. For the majority of the match, Real created the most threat going forward. Joe Hart kept City in the game during the second half as he came up with crucial saves to deny Luka Modrić and Cristiano Ronaldo. City had a chance to snatch a late equaliser through Sergio Agüero, but the Argentine's shot flew over the goal and onto the top of the net. In the end Los Blancos celebrated at the final whistle as they held onto their lead from the first half. Real Madrid are now through to their fourteenth European Cup final where they are to face local rivals Atlético Madrid — whom they faced in the 2014 UEFA Champions League final — on May 28, in Milan.Founded in 1999, and the first-ever 24 hour ultra-marathon race in Taiwan, the 7th Soochow International 24H Ultra-Marathon, took place on November 24-25, 2007. Even though the race has been suspended in the past, in 2000 and 2006, due to poor conditions on the track field, several world-class runners participated in the 2007 race.The Red Bull Racing Formula One racing team must prove to the Malaysian Grand Prix stewards that one of their cars is safe to race after Scottish driver David Coulthard suffered a crash at Friday's  opening practice. It was his second major suspension failure in as many weekends and his third major accident, having had his last race ended prematurely after a collision with Felipe Massa's Ferrari.A part failure caused Coulthard to run off the road. When he subsequently hit a kerb both sides of the front suspension completely failed, ripping both wheels loose. He was unable to participate in any more pre-race practice.After stewards met team head Christian Horner and technical head Adrian Newey a statement was released stating that the FIA technical delegate required to receive a detailed technical report from Red Bull. The purpose of this would be to prove that the vehicle is race worthy as determined by an article in the technical regulations. This article gives stewards the powers to prevent cars from competing if they are deemed to be unsafe."The Stewards, having met with the Team Principal and Technical Representative of Red Bull Racing in relation to the incident involving Car 9 in Practice 1, have requested that the competitor provide to the FIA Technical Delegate a report verifying that the integrity of the suspension is such that the car should not be deemed 'of dangerous constructions' under Art 2.3 of the 2008 Formula One Technical Regulations," read the statement.Howard told reporters he believed there would be no problems with clearing the vehicle for tomorrows race. The failed component, he said, had been fitted immediately after the race at Melbourne. "It was a front right track rod that failed. You can see that the adhesives failed and it just looked like a human error. So we have absolutely no concerns about the car's safety for tomorrow."Coulthard was also confident. I am not worried about my safety. Mechanical failures are part and parcel of grand prix racing unfortunately... We did 10,000 kilometres in testing in the car. It was just a new part which did just six laps. It was a fault in the manufacturing process and game over. One jumbo falls out of the sky you don't ground them. All history shows that things fail now and again. With the front suspension the car rides up."The Washington Redskins defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 31-20 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. With the win, the Redskins advance to the NFL playoffs for the first time in six years.The Redskins pulled ahead in the first quarter, but the Eagles answered with Mike McMahon throwing two touchdowns to rookie wide receiver Reggie Brown.Washington evened the score at 17 on the opening drive of the third quarter, thanks to a 54-yard pass to wide receivcer Santana Moss and a 6-yard running play by running back Clinton Portis. David Akers put the Eagles in the lead again with a 35-yard field goal on the next drive.McMahon then made a crucial mistake, when a bad pass was intercepted by line backer Lemar Mashall at the Philadelphia 22 yard line. Portis ran the ball up the sidelines on the next play for his second touchdown of the game, putting Washington ahead 24-20. Free safety Sean Taylor clinched the victory for the Redskins with a 39-yard fumble return.Portis ran for a total of 112 yards in the game and set a franchise rushing record of 1,432 yards. This is the fifth win in a row for the Redskins, who finish the regular season with a 10-6 record."Looking back to 5-6, we talked at that time that if we lost another game we'd be out," said Washington head coach Joe Gibbs. "Trying to win five straight is a tough deal, but our guys seemed to understand what it would take. We went back to the basics."The Redskins go on to play the Buccaneers (11-5) in Tampa Bay next Saturday at 4:30pm in the wildcard round. The other NFC wild game has the Carolina Panthers (11-5) visiting the New York Giants (11-5). The winners of the wild card round will face the Seattle Seahawks (13-3) or the Chicago Bears (11-5) in the divisional round.Ex-Swiss Formula One driver Clay Regazzoni has died after being involved in a road accident with a lorry. He was sixty seven.Regazzoni was victorious five times during his F1 career, most notably his last win at the 1979 British Grand Prix where he won the first of over 100 wins for the Williams team. His career ended in 1980 after crashing his Ensign during the United States Grand Prix West due to a brake failure. The crash left the Swiss paralyzed from the waist down.Williams team owner Frank Williams, described Regazzoni as "gentleman" and "a pleasure to have with us in the team".Regazzoni was also famous for his moustache and his relaxed personality.USC Trojans running back Reggie Bush has decided to enter the NFL draft and forfeit his final year of college football eligibility. The Heisman Trophy winner is the favorite to be the top pick in the draft, in which case he would play for the Houston Texans. Bush rushed for 1,740 yards during his final college season, and led the Trojans to the Rose Bowl. Quarterbacks Marcus Vick of the Virginia Tech Hokies and Vince Young of the Texas Longhorns are also likely to among the top draft picks this year.But Vick, who was kicked off the Hokies team for repeated brushes with the law off the field, had his chances in the draft further reduced by his latest misdemeanor arrest Sunday for brandishing a firearm at a man he believed made a comment about the young woman he was with.An investigation by the FIA has led to Formula One team Renault to be called to appear before the World Motor Sport Council to answer a race fixing allegation.The charge stems from last year's Singapore Grand Prix. Renault Fernando Alonso won the race after taking an early refuelling stop. Fellow Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr. then crashed, causing a safety car to come out. One by one the cars ahead of Alonso pitted for fuel, allowing him to move up from nineteenth to take victory.Piquet has always maintained that the crash was an accident. If the charges are upheld, the punishments could include a fine, exclusion from races or complete disqualification from the current championship.Renault are due to appear before the council in Paris on September 21st, days before this year's race in Singapore. The team has refused to comment before the hearing.Renault have already been in trouble this season, being suspended for one race after releasing Alonso's car with an unsafe wheel, which came off on the track. The team succeeded in appealing this.Following the Renault Formula One team's acceptance of a race-fixing charge, the team has been given a lifetime ban, suspended for two years. Team boss Flavio Briatore will never again be allowed to take any part in F1.Although not a licence holder himself, the FIA, F1's governing body, has made it clear at yesterday's meeting of the World Motorsport Council that it will refuse to sanction any events Briatore is involved in or licence any F1 racers he works with. He did not attend the hearing in Paris.Renault's ban will only be enforced if the team is found guilty of a similar offence in the next two years. Top engineer Pat Symonds was banned for five years. The decision not to kick Renault out of Formula One was largely due to mitigating factors, including the fact that Renault submitted additional evidence against itself after deciding not to contest the claims.Retired British racing drive Damon Hill commented on the developments: "I'm not surprised they've let Renault off. It's a crying shame for the sport. Formula One has to ask itself, is it just a very expensive form of entertainment or a proper sport?"Part of the evidence came from a team member identified only as Witness X. Witness X's identity is known only to a few within Formula One and the FIA, and testimony given by him or her included confirming that Briatore was fully aware of the race-fixing plan. Nelson Piquet Jr, the driver who deliberately crashed his car last year, was granted immunity as another whistleblower.Renault F1 have hit back at their sacked driver Nelson Piquet Jr. after a leaked transcript of his evidence to the sport's governing body revealed he claimed to have been ordered to crash to fix a race. They have taken their case to the police.Renault now has to appear before the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) on September 21 to answer a race-fixing charge. They have also made a complaint to the French police against Piquet and his father Nelson Piquet Sr., claiming blackmail and false allegations. "Renault F1 Team and its managing director Flavio Briatore have commenced criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Jr. and Nelson Piquet Sr. concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail the team into allowing Piquet Jr. to drive for the remainder of the 2009 season. The matter will also be referred to the police in Britain." Piquet Sr. is a three-times former world champion.Piquet Jr. crashed in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix just after an early pit stop for Fernando Alonso, bringing out the safety car. As the cars ahead of Alonso went in for fuel under the safety car, he moved up the pack to take victory. Piquet Jr. was sacked after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."I was asked by Mr Flavio Briatore and [engineer] Mr. Pat Symonds to deliberately crash my car in order to positively influence the performance of the Team at the event," said Piquet Jr. "I agreed to this proposal and caused my car to hit a wall and crash during lap 13/14 of the race." He added "At the time of this conversation, I was in a very fragile and emotional state of mind - brought about by intense stress due to the fact that Mr Briatore had refused to inform me of whether or not my contract would be renewed for the next racing year."According to an FIA press release, the 1-race ban imposed on the Renault Formula One team following an incident at the Hungarian Grand Prix has been overturned.The team was reprimanded after allowing Alonso to leave the pit lane with the wheel insecurely attached to the car, which then detached itself out on the circuit.  The wheel bounced dangerously down the back straight, fortunately not coming into contact with any other vehicles.After hearing evidence from all parties, including Renault's Engineering Director Pat Symonds, the FIA's International Court of Appeal has repealed the one race suspension, and has instead imposed a $50,000 fine and have "issued a reprimand".The decision allows Fernando Alonso to race in his second of two home Grands Prix this year, and will likely open the door for Renault's test driver Romain Grosjean to take up the second seat, following the dismissal of seasoned underperformer Nelson Piquet Jr.Renault F1 team boss Flavio Briatore and engineering director Pat Symonds have both split ways with the team. The move comes as Renault announce they will not fight a charge of race-fixing.Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) accused Renault of ordering Nelson Piquet, Jr. to crash during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. The wreck brought out the safety car and most other competitors made refueling stops while it was out. However, Renault's Fernando Alonso had pitted unusually early and was able to move up to take one of just two victories that year.The FIA interviewed Piquet after an investigation was triggered by claims published by Globo TV. Piquet's interview was leaked, and he placed the blame squarely on Briatore and Symonds."The proposal to deliberately cause an accident was made to me shortly before the race took place, when I was summoned by Mr. Briatore and Mr. Symonds in Mr. Briatore’s office... When I was asked to crash my car I accepted because I hoped it could improve my position within the team at this critical time in the race season," Piquet said in the interview.Piquet further stated that he received no assurances he would still be racing for Renault in 2009. Although he continued to race for Renault in 2009, he was sacked midway through the current season.Renault will discover their punishment at a hearing before the World Motor Sport Council in Paris, France. They face the possibility of being banned from Formula One. Piquet has received immunity from the FIA for his testimony. Data showed Piquet accelerating into the wall instead of braking as he approached it.Briatore has a long history with Renault. He started off with Benetton Formula in 1988 and was team principal for Michael Schumacher's 1994 and 1995 world title wins. He left in 1997 but Renault made him head again after he helped the French firm buy the team in 2000. He was there for Alonso's world championship wins in 2005 and 2006.Two of Renault Formula One's sponsors have terminated their contracts after Renault's race-fixing last year. The move comes as Renault racer Romain Grosjean crashed into the same corner as the one Nelson Piquet Jr deliberately hit to ensure victory for his team-mate last year.Renault's main sponsor, Dutch bank ING, had already said it would not renew its three-year contract when it expires at the current season's end, but has now pulled out four races early. It said the recent revelations were "very disappointing". Spanish insurers Mutua Madrileña echoed this sentiment, saying that moral issues, as well as the fact the manoeuvre was dangerous, reflected badly on sponsors.The firms have quit because Renault this month admitted to cheating during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. Piquet drove his car into a wall after fellow Renault driver Fernando Alonso had refuelled early. A safety car came out and as various drivers went in to refuel behind it, Alonso was able to move up and secure a win. Alonso, who is Spanish, was also personally sponsored by Mutua Madrileña and this contract remains unchanged.Formula One's governing body, the FIA, ordered a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council when the allegations surfaced. At that meeting, Renault were given a two-year suspended sentence that will see them kicked out of the sport if they cheat again in that time-frame. Team boss Flavio Briatore was banned for life and engineer Pat Symonds was banned for five years due to their roles in the incident. These developments come days after the European Sponsorship Association said that cheating scandals jeopardised funding for teams in major competitions. Renault's remaining sponsors are French-based international energy firm Total, tyre manufacturer Bridgestone, Russian communications provider Megafon, Pepe Jeans, and Internet educator Universia. Renault have confirmed an intention to remain in F1 despite the recent controversy.Practice sessions for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix were held today. "Sorry guys, I lost the car in turn 17," Grosjean announced over the team's radio, spinning out on the same corner as Piquet drove into a year ago to trigger the scandal dubbed "Crashgate" by the media. Once more, a safety car appeared while the Renault was removed. A photograph of the car after Grosjean's accident did not reveal obvious major damage, though it did clearly show that the names of two sponsors have disappeared.Pakistani cricket coach Bob Woolmer, who was found dead in his hotel room after the shock loss of the Pakistani cricket team to lowly-ranked Ireland during the Cricket World Cup, was poisoned before being strangled, according to a TV report due to be broadcast on the BBC News programme Panorama.According to the programme, a toxicology report prepared after Woolmer's death indicates that he had a substance in his bloodstream which would have incapacitated him, leaving him helpless.  This would explain how Woolmer, a large man over six feet tall, was strangled with little sign of a struggle.Speculation has been rife in the cricketing community that Woolmer's death is connected to match fixing, a practice which rocked the sport in the late 1990s.  Jamaican police, however, have consistently refused to comment as to whether they have any leads on the case.Atlanta Falcon's quarterback Michael Vick will enter federal court on Monday, but a newly published report says he will not admit to gambling or killing the dogs. However, Vick is expected to plead guilty to the charge of 'interstate commerce for the purpose of dogfighting.' A source told ESPN he did not kill any dogs, but he was present when the dogs were being killed.Vick faces a maximum of five years in jail. However, a government source told the Associated Press yesterday that prosecutors would most likely recommend a sentence of 12 to 18 months in prison.Three co-defendants in the case have already pleaded guilty and, if the case goes to trial, will likely testify against Vick.Vick's future in the NFL is still uncertain.News reports are suggesting that Formula One's governing body, the FIA, are investigating alleged race-fixing by Renault. The FIA would only confirm a probe into "alleged incidents at a previous Formula One world championship event."According to Brazil's Globo TV, Renault racer Nelson Piquet Jr. was told to crash his car during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, which was the sport's first night race. By accident or design, Piquet did indeed crash during the race, which benefited teamate Fernando Alonso, who had just pitted early for fuel. Alonso went on to win the race.Piquet was fired during this season by Renault and replaced with Romain Grosjean. He claims he was treated unfairly at the team. His comments about the race at the time were "We tried two extreme strategies with Fernando quite short and me quite long in the hope of getting a safety car. If I hadn't crashed I would have been lucky with the safety car later in the race..."However, it is now reported that new evidence has been supplied to the FIA. The source of this evidence has not been disclosed. The world motorsport council has the power to impose harsh penalties upon Renault if the allegations are proven, including large fines.While the debris from the crash was cleared, the safety car was out on the track. Because Alonso had pitted early, he was the only one of the leading cars that did not need to stop for fuel and new tyres. According to the BBC and The Times, if there is found to be evidence of misconduct the world motorsport council will probably meet to investigate.Having drawn with Israel twice in their last two games, the Republic of Ireland football squad have received a much needed confidence boost. They beat the Faroe Islands 2-nil away to earn the three points which takes them to the top of Group 4; one ahead of Switzerland. However the Irish have seven games played - one more than most of the other Group four members.After a fruitless first half, Ireland gained the upper hand in the 51st minute thanks to a solid penalty taken by Ian Harte. The penalty was given after the home team's keeper, Jakup Mikkelsen, brought down Stephen Elliott.The second goal came shortly after when Kevin Kilbane found the back of the net to finally settle the Irish nerves.Residents of a Leeds, England neighbourhood have requested help from a council because their neighbourhood is plagued by crime, overcrowding, and community tensions. Leeds City Council received a request for help from residents of Hyde Park, who said they were worried about the increasing level of anti-social behavior and worsening community relations. A report will be unveiled on Wednesday by a council delegation, highlighting the problems in the area. "The people living in Hyde Park come from widely different population groups... these groups have very different customs, needs and living styles and this can provoke high levels of tension in the area," the delegation said. The council claims that because of the 28 per cent ethnic minority population and the 40,000 students living in the neighbourhood, there are tensions between residents. They added, however, that they are actively encouraging people to work together, citing a multi-faith forum, a cricket competition and activities which bring old and young together. The report says that the council are trying to build relationships between Muslims and police, something which they said is "particularly important after the area's connection to the London bombings on 7th July 2005." A local newspaper reported that "the Shebab project introduces young Muslims to role models from sport and culture and also runs scholars' talks to counter extremist ideologies."Crime has increased by 7% in the past year in Hyde Park, and residents noted that anti-social behaviour was getting worse. The council said that an anti-burglary task force had helped to reduce the number of thefts from homes. Residents complained that there was a lack of pride in the area, and at the end of the academic year in the summer, large piles of rubbish were left in streets, yards and alleyways. The report adds that the council operates a recycling scheme aimed towards teenagers, and that rubbish collections have increased.The Guardian reported on Wednesday that campaigners are attempting to "take control of a derelict school building and transform it into a community hub are appealing for sponsors and partners in a bid to turn their dreams into reality." They say that the unused building, owned by the council, could be used for meetings and events. A volunteer group of residents have been working on a business plan, and have gained support from local businesses to create "a vision of an open, accessible and valuable resource for all." A member of the commitee, however, said he was "frustrated" with the council's attitude towards the plans. "The RPCC is slightly frustrated with certain communication issues that we've had with the council, but we're working with them and hoping to gain further assistance going forward," he said. "It's a shame that certain setbacks could have been avoided."The deputation added that "a major factor in Hyde Park's suffering is its high level of population density", which they conceded is something they are unable to change. The council responded to complaints that streets are "cheap and unhealthy takeaways, letting agents and boarded-up shop fronts," by saying that Hyde Park Corner and Headingley are, according to the Yorkshire Post, "thriving shopping areas and work had taken place to ensure a good mix of outlets."The report concludes: "The council acknowledges that because of the very particular circumstances which exist in the neighbourhood, Hyde Park faces difficult challenges which affect the quality of life of residents and that 'normal' service levels may not be sufficient to tackle some of these. The council will do more to enable local people to influence how services work and how local problems are tackled. Local community and voluntary groups will be invited to play an active role."Through a press release, by Tie Domi's lawyer Tuesday evening, it was revealed that Domi may initiate legal action against Lee Miller, coach of the Toronto Marlboros peewee AAA hockey club.Domi, who retired from the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2006, was known as an enforcer and fighter during his playing days. Domi accrued the most penalty minutes of any player in the history of the Leafs and is ranked third overall for penalty minutes in the National Hockey League (NHL).On Friday, March 30, Domi was involved in a verbal confrontation with coach Miller over differences of opinion on coaching styles and, allegedly, the amount of ice time Domi's son was receiving. Domi's 11-year-old son, Max, plays for the Marlboros.According to a Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL) media release yesterday, Domi had confronted Miller using, allegedly, foul and profane language. Toronto Police were called to the rink to deal with the situation, but no charges were laid.On Monday, April 2, the GTHL received a formal complaint from Miller outlining his version of events. A review by the league is expected to finish up by April 18.According to Symon Zucker, Domi's counsel, the suggestion that an assault, or threat of assault, by Domi had occurred during the altercation with Miller, was without merit. Although Zucker admitted that Domi and Miller did have a disagreement over Miller's coaching skills, he suggested the discussion did not escalate to threats. Zucker alleged that the police investigation, which cleared Domi of the allegations, left Miller dissatisfied and that Miller "decided to report his allegations to the media with the intent of embarrassing Mr. Domi."Zucker indicated that Domi instructed him to put "Miller on notice of an intention to seek damages for libel and slander," according to the press release. "Mr. Miller's public campaign to discredit Mr. Domi is actionable and will be strenuously defended," said Zucker.Today, Joachim Löw, manager of the German national football team, dropped Borussia Dortmund midfielder Marco Reus from the UEFA Euro 2016 squad. Marco Reus, who turned 27 years old today, is suffering from a groin injury. He also missed the 2014 FIFA World Cup with an ankle injury.Löw said their medical staff wasn't sure Reus could meet the demands of the forthcoming games. He added, "Marco has serious fitness problems; he can only run in a straight line at the moment." ((de))German language: ‍Marco hat massive gesundheitliche Probleme, im Moment kann er nur geradeaus laufen.Löw also did not include other Bundesliga players Karim Bellarabi, Julian Brandt, and Sebastian Rudy from the provisional squad in the final selection. Thanking the four German internationals for their performance in training, he said, "It's not a decision against those four players, but rather one in favour of the other 23." ((de))German language: ‍Es ist keine Entscheidung gegen vier Spieler, sondern eine Entscheidung für 23 Spieler.Germany are due to play their final friendly match before the start of Euro 2016 on June 4 against Hungary. On June 12, Germany will open their account in Euro 2016 when they face Ukraine in Lille, France.On Sunday, French winger Franck Ribéry signed a one-year contract extension with Bayern Munich, the German football club announced. The contract runs through June 2018.33-year-old Ribéry joined the German side in 2007 from French club Olympique de Marseille. Since then, the Frenchman has scored 108 goals and provided 164 assists in 333 appearances for Bayern. Spending nine years with Munich, Ribéry has won six Bundesliga titles and five DFB Pokal Cups. In 2013, Ribéry won the UEFA Champions League and the European Footballer of the Year award.Last season, Ribéry won the Bundesliga title and the DFB-Pokal cup against Bayern's arch rivals Borussia Dortmund. Ribéry's previous contract would have ended after June 2017. After signing the contract extension, Ribéry said, "I'm very happy to play for FC Bayern for another year [...] This great club and the city have become my home, both in terms of sport and in private. I'm looking forward to many more beautiful moments together with the FC Bayern fans, and I want to play my part in the team's success in the next one and a half years." ((de))German language: ‍Ich bin sehr glücklich, ein weiteres Jahr für den FC Bayern spielen zu dürfen [...] Dieser großartige Klub und die Stadt sind meine Heimat geworden, sowohl sportlich als auch privat. Ich freue mich noch auf viele schöne Momente zusammen mit den Fans des FC Bayern und möchte meinen Teil dazu beitragen, dass wir auch in den kommenden eineinhalb Jahren erfolgreich sein werden.The Rice University baseball team defeated the University of Oklahoma 10-4 in the first game of the NCAA Super Regional.Brian Friday and Josh Rodriguez helped push Rice to an early led with consecutive home runs in a four-run first inning.Wayne Graham, Rice's head coach, said, "Obviously, I'm happy with the way we hit the ball.  We attacked the ball real well. When we answered their runs, that was critical. We never got complacent."Rice (54-10) and Oklahoma (44-21) will meet Sunday for the second game in the series at Rice's Reckling Park.  If Oklahoma wins, a third game will be played Monday.

Despite early match odds suggesting Hatton would dominate the fight, this was not the case. Each round was close, but most pundits and judges alike agreed that Urango only won 1 of the 12 rounds, with Hatton taking the other 11.Despite the unfamiliar confines of Las Vegas, Hatton looked touched by the ringing of football fan-like chants, familiar in British boxing, that rang around the arena, as more than half of it was filled by traveling support from across the atlantic.Many in the UK will hope Hatton has ended the "curse" that has seen names such as Frank Bruno, Naseem Hamed, Barry McGuigan and others fall short while headlining fights on "The Strip".From here, it is widely believed "The Hitman" will move on to fight Jose Luis Castillo in June, again likely in Vegas.A little over 100 days before the scheduled start of the 2016 Summer Olympics, on Thursday the Olympic flame was ignited in a ceremony at the temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece.  Actress Katerina Lehu played the role of priestess accompanied by fourteen virgins, lighting the flame at solar noon using sunlight focused by a parabolic mirror.After lighting the "sacred fire" Lehu passed it to its first bearer, gymnast Lefteris Petrunias. According to El País, another torchbearer is to be a Syrian refugee, bearing it in the Eleonas refugee camp.International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said the lighting ceremony was writing history, and the Olympic Games would bring a message of hope in difficult times to Brazil and to the whole world. Over six days, the Olympic torch is to pass through more than 2000 kilometers of Greek territory, going through Marathon and the island of Corfu. This part of the ride ends at the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, site of the first modern Games of the Olympiad.Subsequently, the flame travels by plane to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne where it is to stay for a week. Later, on May 2, it is to be moved to Brasilia. The relay trip of the Olympic flame from Olympia to the Olympic site was introduced by Carl Diem in the Berlin 1936 Games.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has selected Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.  IOC President Jacques Rogge made the announcement Friday in an IOC meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark on Friday.The other three contestants, Chicago, Madrid, and Tokyo, were eliminated in earlier rounds of voting.  Chicago was the first candidate city eliminated in voting, with Tokyo being dropped in the second round.  Rio de Janeiro was left to compete with Madrid.Rogge said that Rio de Janeiro had "a very strong technical bid, built upon a vision of the Games being a celebration of the athletes and sport, as well as providing the opportunity for the city, region and country to deliver their broader long-term aspirations for the future." He added that "this call to 'live your passion' clearly struck a chord with my fellow members, and we now look forward to seeing Rio de Janeiro staging the first Olympic Games on the continent of South America.""Rio is ready. Give us this chance and you will not regret it," Brazil's president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had told the committee before the vote. "Rio will deliver an unforgettable Games. You will see for yourselves the passion, the energy and the creativity of the Brazilian people." "All those people who thought we had no ability to govern this country will now learn that we can host the Olympics," Lula had said after the winning city was named. "There is a lot of work ahead of us and we will start working early. The Brazilian people are good and generous and the country deserves it."German football club FC Bayern Munich yesterday announced Dutch winger Arjen Robben has signed a one contract extension until June 2018.32-year-old Robben joined the German side in 2009 from Spanish capital club Real Madrid.

Hunter edged out Fabian Cancellara and Murilo Fischer in a tight sprint.Michael Rasmussen of Denmark retained the overall lead finishing the stage with the first peleton. The biggest change in the chase for the yellow jersey was Christophe Moreau losing more than three minutes on the leaders and dropping out of the top ten.For a good portion of the stage, Wegmann, Florencio, Gilbert, Millar and Fofonov had the lead. The five-man breakaway group was gobbled up by the peleton. With 30 km to go the peleton split into two clearly defined main groups with about 1:40 separating them. The gap grew to two full minutes with 20 km to go. The second peleton finished 3:17 behind Hunter's time.The 182.5 km stage 11, from Marseille to Montpellier, is the first of two transition stages between the Alps and the Pyrenees, with no major climbs.In the wake of the doping test of Patrik Sinkewitz, German networks ZDF and ARD ended their live coverage of the Tour. In response, Tour organizers, Amaury Sport Organisation, signed deals with  Sat.1 and ProSieben, so that German fans can continue to watch."With the agreement of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) a replacement solution has been found. We have leased the TV rights to Sat.1 and ProSieben," Yann Le Moenner of ASO told Reuters.Pole Robert Kubica won the FIA Formula One 2008 Grand Prix du Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Ile Notre Dame, Montreal, Canada. He and his teammate Nick Heidfeld made a double for BMW Sauber team for the first time in history of this sport.Peter Sauber first started building sport cars in 1970. His team made it's Formula-1 debut in 1993. The team was handed over to BMW after 2005 and now it's team principal is Mario Theissen.Nick Heidfeld also came second in the previous year race won by Lewis Hamilton. It was a race when Kubica suffered a violent crash. David Coulthard was the best of Renault-engined cars finishing third for Red Bull.The race was thrilled after Adrian Sutil suffered his Force India car failure and caused a safety car to appear. This happened right before the scheduled first pit-stops and 5 drivers who were in the lead rushed to refuel themselves after the pit lane became open. Still, the pit lane exit remained closed and Robert Kubica with Kimi Räikkönen (Ferrari) stopped in front of the red sign. But Lewis Hamilton did not. He crashed hard into the back of Räikkönen and jammed the exit for the drivers behind. This cleared the cards for BMW team to win the race.The pace car also gave the lucky chance for Toyota drivers, who were not very competitive in qualifying on Saturday, starting 11th and 14th. Timo Glock made up 4th after holding Felipe Massa (Ferrari) pushed him from behind. Jarno Trulli could also finished in front of Massa, but Timo braked hard on his teammate and Jarno was forced to let Massa pass him.Rubens Barrichello (Honda) finished 7th. Heikki Kovalainen (Vodafone McLaren Mercedes) pushed hard on Sebastian Vettel but German kept his position and scored 1 point for Toro Rosso.It should be noted that Kubica won the race after he finished second in the previous Monaco GP won by Hamilton. Kubica now leads the drivers' championship with 42 points, chased by Hamilton and Massa with 38 points both, Räikkönen with 35 points and Heidfeld with 28. BMW Sauber now stayed close to Ferrari in constructors' standings with 70 points, gap of 3 to Ferrari. Team McLaren is now a distant third with 53 points.Rancagua, Chile — Cristóbal Cortina and Víctor Vergara, in conjunction with their horses "Cumpa" and "Tío Pedro", have won the last phase in the 62nd Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo.

The Swiss Federer, who is ranked world number one in men's tennis, has now won a total of sixteen Grand Slam titles. Going into the final Murray had won six of the ten matches where the two players had met before, and had hopes of becoming the first British man to win a Grand Slam title in 74 years. The last was Fred Perry, who won the US Open in 1936. In 2008 Federer and Murray met in the final of that tournament, where the Swiss player won an easy victory.This time the match was closer, with Murray fighting hard in the third set and at one point leading it 5–2.  Federer pulled back to force a tie break, where he eventually triumphed after 2 hours 41 minutes of play.After the match an emotional Murray said: "I can cry like Roger, it's just a shame I can’t play like him. I loved every minute of it and hopefully one time I can come back and win here."Federer said he was "over the moon" to win again, and congratulated Murray on his performance in the tournament, saying he was "too good a player not to win a Grand Slam."The Australian Open, held on hard courts at Melbourne Park, is the first Grand Slam tennis tournament of the year. The top prize is A$2,000,000. Federer previously won in 2004, 2006 and 2007.Swiss tennis player Roger Federer won his first Les Internationaux de France de Roland Garros or Tournoi de Roland-Garros (French Open) championship on Sunday by defeating Robin Söderling from Sweden 6-1 7-6(1) 6-4 in Paris. In winning this tournament, Federer joins Pete Sampras with 14 Grand Slam tournaments won and along with Andre Agassi is the second man in the Open Era (since 1968) to clinch all four major tournaments. In the last four years, only Rafael Nadal has stopped Federer from winning the French Grand Slam title missing from his collection. The match took place in bad weather conditions with light rain and strong winds during the first two sets, a situation which became worse during the third. Uneasy and visibly nervous, Söderling lost the first set in just 23 minutes. In the second, he began to play better tennis and at 2-1, after an interruption by a man on court, Federer seemed to lose power. He finally clinched the tie-break 7-1 by shooting four aces. The third set was won 6-4 by Federer who fell to the ground, sobbing.After the match, Söderling said that Federer was the "greatest player of all times" and that Federer gave him "a lesson of tennis."In the 2009 ATP Ranking, Federer moves closer to Nadal after he lost to Söderling in the fourth round. Before the tournament, Nadal had a 4500 points lead. Since Monday, he has a 2070 point lead. The next Grand Slam tournament is Wimbledon in London and begins on June 22, 2009.Carmen Moraru, the promotion and marketing director at ANT said that many tourists came as part of holiday packages or tours, organised around the regions of Maramureş, Transylvania, Moldova, the Prahova Valley and the Danube Delta.In 2005, the number of tourist arrivals is set to rise further, mainly due to a Romanian promotion campaign launched across Europe. The country's tourist revival is mainly due to its diversity - it is home to Europe's largest delta, the Black Sea Coast with its resorts, the Carpathian Mountains with their skiing and winter activities, Transylvania with its ecotourism, agritourism and beautiful landscapes, as well as the medieval history of cities like Sibiu and Sighişoara.Yesterday, women's standing LW4 classified skier Laura Valeanu finished eighth in her group in the slalom event, marking the first appearance of a Romanian skier at the 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships in La Molina, Spain.  No other Romanian skiers have competed thus far in the competition.  Valeanu was also her country's only participant at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver where she finished fourteenth in the giant slalom and earned a Did Not Finish in the slalom event.Valeanu completed her first slalom run in La Molina in a time of 1:16.48, the eighth best time on that run.  Her second run was a little under two seconds slower at 1:18.42, and the ninth best time in the run.  Despite that, her combined run time of 2:34.90 was faster than ninth and last place finisher Úrsula Pueyo who had a combined run time of 2:35.85.  Valeanu's combined time was nearly thirty seconds slower than French winner Marie Bouchet.The women's standing group started with twelve skiers, but three skiers failed to finish their first run including Finland's Katja Saarinen, United States skier Allison Jones and Russian Mariya Papulova.The 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships continues today with the Super Combined event scheduled.Yesterday, Spanish capital football club Real Madrid announced winger and Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a new five-year contract running through June 2021.Ronaldo joined Los Blancos in the summer of 2009 from English club Manchester United F.C. Since then, he has netted 371 goals for the club. Spending seven seasons with Real Madrid, Ronaldo has won two UEFA Champions League trophies, both against their city rivals Atlético de Madrid, and one La Liga title. He has also won two Copa del Rey, one Supercopa de España, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.Per the previous contract, Ronaldo was tied to the club till July 2018. The Daily Mail reported Ronaldo would probably continue to earn about £365,000 (€410,000) per week.This year, Ronaldo won the UEFA Champions League in Milan, scoring the winning penalty, and in July he won the UEFA Euro 2016 with Portugal. Almost a year ago, last season, Ronaldo became Real Madrid's top scorer breaking the previous record of Raúl's 323 goals.In the press conference, Ronaldo expressed his desire to play till the age of 41 saying, "I'm going to be here for another five years, but let it be known this will not be my last contract". When asked about his retirement, he said, "No-one knows what the future holds."A week ago, the club announced Welsh forward Gareth Bale had signed a six-year contract extension.Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo surpassed Raúl's goal scoring record for Spanish club Real Madrid in a La Liga match against Levante UD on Saturday. Ronaldo netted his 324th goal in his 310th match for Los Blancos on Saturday, breaking the  previous record set by Spanish footballer Raúl of 323 goals in 741 games. He earlier equaled Raúl's goal scoring record for Madrid in a UEFA Champions League match against Swedish football club Malmö FF when he scored a brace, crossing the landmark of 500 career goals and scored the record-breaking goal in the 30th minute from outside the penalty area in this match.In Saturday's match, Real Madrid had 58% ball possession against Levante. The match saw five yellow cards — four for the visitors and one for Real Madrid player Kovačić. A total of eighteen fouls were committed in the game. Ronaldo assisted Brazilian Marcelo in the 27th minute and Marcelo netted the goal in the left corner. Minutes later, Toni Kroos assisted Ronaldo, and he scored the record-breaking goal in the bottom right corner. The first half ended 2–0.At the beginning of the second half, Vázquez was substituted for Gareth Bale.

The 28-year-old midfielder — turned 29 yesterday — signed for three years with the South Dublin side.Finn previously played for Shamrock Rovers between 2011 and 2014 where he was part of the side that won the 2011 League of Ireland Premier Division before moving on to Dundalk where he won two further League of Ireland titles and an FAI cup.Finn said, "It's been a great two years at Dundalk but I'm delighted to be back here at Shamrock Rovers. It's very exciting times here and I'm delighted to be part of it."Shamrock Rovers manager Stephen Bradley also announced that Ronan Finn will be made club captain.

After a string of decisions (which the red half of Manchester perceived to be unfair) being given in City's favour, and with the untimely booking of Ronaldo, both Ferguson and Rooney were pushed to their limits of patience, swearing out loud in disbelief.Rooney was first to be heard mouthing off after the decision was taken to give Ronaldo his marching orders. He was observed swearing at the referee at half time, and then continuing the tirade throughout the game as a string of bad decisions were taken which stripped United of their fluidity in the game. Despite the language from Rooney being far from usual, a barrage of assaults were thrown to and from the referee and the striker right through the game.After the decision was given to take off Christiano Ronaldo, Ferguson's temper boiled and he was heard by many sitting around him to call the referee a "f*cking tw*t" as well as calling his decisions a "f*cking disgrace". This later led on to Ferguson launching threats at the referee during half time, and accusing the referee of not being able to handle under the pressure of a premiership game as well as questioning his judgement of the offside rule.Ferguson himself admitted that Ronaldo's tackle was rash, and also noted that the side seemed to get better after he had been sent off, saying that they were playing better with 10 men. He still maintained that the side defended well, despite the fact that new signing Patrice Evra and Mikael Silvestre afforded City easy opportunities to slip goals in.The fine that both Ferguson and Rooney will receive is unknown, although it is thought to be similar to the ban he received in 2003, in which he received a 3 match touchline-ban, and a £100,000 after swearing at Jeffery Winter.On the morning of Monday, January 2, 2006, the 117th Tournament of Roses Rose Parade marched through Pasadena, California in only the tenth occurrence of rain on the morning of the parade.  Fifty mile-an-hour winds buffeted the crowds of spectators for hours before and during the festivities.Many spectators had purchased grandstand tickets for $50 or more only to find the aluminum benches cold and exposed to the winds.  Umbrellas were ubiquitus though difficult to use effectively in the storm-like conditions.  Virtually anyone present for more than an hour had a poncho of some sort.  Those who partook in the traditional campout to claim free seating on the street often left only a single person to stoically wait out the storm until morning, most preferring to sleep in dryer conditions.  Crowds were smaller than normal.Vendors fared somewhat differently, depending on what they sold.  Sales of hot food and drinks, umbrellas, ponchos, and tarps were up while sales of pre-packaged snacks and programs were down.  Many street vendors left once sales or inventory dried up (figuritively speaking).On Sunday, Ross Edgley, aged 33, completed his 157-day (five-month) staged swim around Great Britain mainland. He went ashore at Margate, Thanet, Kent, England at 8:40 a.m. local time. This was the first time a human swam the roughly 2,800 km (1750 miles) around the island.The finish line was marked by a large air-filled construction at the beach, with the Red Bull brand on it. Upon reaching the shore, Ross Edgley was welcomed by a large crowd, several hundreds of people. People ordered three pizzas for Ross Edgley at local theme park Dreamland.Ross Edgley said, "It feels a bit weird on land, [...] a bit too solid for my liking! I almost fell over when I started to jog into shore. [...] My feelings now are pride, tiredness and relief. It's been a team effort and it's thanks to the whole crew, the support I've received from the public."Several hundred swimmers joined Ross Edgley on the last mile. Two Red Bull planes also accompanied the swimmer at the last mile.Ross Edgley had been swimming for six hours twice each day when possible, in a wetsuit. He spent the remaining time eating or sleeping on his support boat, a catamaran named "Hectate".  Sailor Matthew Knight piloted the catamaran.Ross Edgley shared photos and text about the adventure on Instagram. The photos and communication showed that he faced problems with jellyfish and large waves, while in other times the weather favoured his swim. He also sustained bruised feet as a result of the swimming. In the salt environment he also had "disintegrating tongue".On August 14, the 74th day of the swim, Ross Edgley reportedly beat the world duration record for a staged sea swim, 73 days. Ross Edgley started the swim on June 1. Red Bull backed the swim.In 2016 Ross Edgley climbed a height equivalent to Mount Everest's, on a rope in less than 24 hours.Ross Edgley is from Lincolnshire.Dutch adventurer Ralph Tuijn has reached the halfway point of his attempt to be the first person to row across the Pacific Ocean unaided.The 16,000 kilometre journey from the coast of Peru to the seaside city of Brisbane, Australia, the widest section of the Pacific, has never been crossed absolutely unaided by a rower, and Tuijn says just nine people have rowed it even with assistance.Tuijn reached the central point of his crossing, an insignificant point of water in the ocean, 111 days after setting off from Peru in March. He has been making good progress, and has since cut his estimated time of arrival in Brisbane by a month.The Dutchman, who now expects to reach his destination on October 20, has kept in touch with those tracking his movements through daily internet postings from his laptop computer, including his wife Winnie. His boat, the Zeeman Challenger, is a seven-metre custom plywood vessel.Tuijn has overcome a variety of obstacles to reach the halfway point. He is suffering from the constant attention of sharks, who often bump his boat and disrupt his attempts at sleep. One particular shark, dubbed 'Gomulka' by Tuijn, has been trailing the adventurer's boat for extended periods.He has also accidentally burnt himself when he spilled hot water on his foot whilst trying to make coffee, apparently also from a shark 'bump'. He is also forced to manually pump water for cooking and drinking after his automatic water pump broke down not long into his journey.His vessel has no motors or sails, but relies on his physical rowing power to move. The boat does have a solar power system to provide energy for his laptop, a telephone and a global positioning system.Tujin, who is raising money for a children's home in Mumbai, India, is rowing at an average speed of 58 kilometres each day. His diet consists of freeze-dried foods and fish, which are keeping him physically well-conditioned despite tiring mentally.Tuijn is a serial adventurer and experienced rower. He has rowed across the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, as well as cycled across Russia and the icy terrain of Greenland.Cambridge University have defeated Oxford University by 1¼ lengths to win the 153rd Boat Race. The Light Blues won with a time of 17 minutes and 49 seconds to record their first win in three years. Oxford finished with a time of 18 minutes and 2 seconds.Oxford won the toss and chose to row on the Surrey side of the river, with Cambridge rowing on the Middlesex side. Oxford had the stronger start and were ahead for much of the first half of the race. They had a slight advantage over Cambridge at Hammersmith Bridge, where they would be favoured by racing the inside of the upcoming bend. However Cambridge never lost touch and pulled ahead at Chiswick steps, maintaining their lead for the remainder of the race. Before the race, Cambridge were strong favourites, being 9lb heavier per man on average. The Cambridge crew had 5 returning blues compared to Oxford's one. Furthermore the international achievement of Cambridge's rowers far exceeded that of Oxford: the World Champion stern pair of Germans Thorsten Engelmann (the heaviest ever oarsman at 110.8kg) and Sebastian Schulte, Olympic Gold medallist Kieran West MBE and GB medal winner Tom James. The heavily fancied Cambridge crew did not win by the margin expected by many, thanks in part to a strong row from Oxford, and the sagging stern containing the heaviest Cambridge oarsmen. Also of note, only a week before, Cambridge were victorious at the prestigious Head of the River Race (raced on the same course, but from Mortlake to Putney). However the race was abandoned due to weather conditions with only 29 out of 420 crews finishing.  The race, first held in 1829, is currently held on a 6,779 m (4 miles and 374 yards) stretch of the River Thames in London from Putney to Mortlake. Overall, Cambridge lead Oxford by 79 wins to 73 with one dead heat.In the earlier race for reserve crews, Goldie (Cambridge) beat Isis (Oxford).Racing for the women's and lightweight crews took place at Henley on April 1st, where Cambridge won the Women's Boat Race and Oxford won the reserve women's, lightweight women's, lightweight men's and reserve lightweight men's races.Brawn-Mercedes driver Rubens Barrichello won the FIA Formula One 2009 Telefónica Grand Prix of Europe at the street circuit, Valencia, Spain.

The last spot on the podium was filled by Kimi Räikkönen in a Ferrari after Hamilton crashed dramatically on the last lap chasing Button too hard.Brawn executed a one pit-stop strategy that allowed them to save time they would lose otherwise by competing with the KERS-equipped cars in front of them on the grid.Once again the race gave a good result for the Force India team as Adrian Sutil chased Räikkönen. Starting from second place on the grid, Sutil was quickly passed by the KERS-equipped Räikkönen's car in the first corner as in the previous race he overtook the pole-sitter Giancarlo Fisichella, who is now racing for Ferrari.The other Force India driver, Vitantonio Liuzzi,  surprised the spectators by qualifying 7th on Saturday, but he retired on lap 22 when his transmission broke.Fernando Alonso pushed hard throughout the race to finish fifth and score 4 more points for Renault, ahead of the McLaren of Heikki Kovalainen.Nick Heidfeld managed to get two points for BMW Sauber after starting from the back of the grid as far as 15th.

Today, Italy played England at the Stadio Flaminio, Rome.France has won the 2007 RBS Six Nations Championship today, following their victory over Scotland at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis. Earlier in the day, Ireland beat Italy at the Stadio Flaminio, Rome, and, following the France-Scotland match, Wales beat England at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.Various rumours and reports with regards to a possible move to Ferrari by Fernando Alonso were given more credibility today when McLaren team principle Martin Whitmarsh alluded to the move in an interview with the BBC. "At the moment we have not had, nor are we in, conversations with any other drivers and we will see in the future. In reality, there are some changes probably with Fernando and Ferrari and that frees up the driver market," he said, when asked about what 2010 held for his team.A possible move has been talked about for some months. Back in July, Italy's Gazzetta dello sport reported a possible move, noting that Spanish banking giant Santander will sponsor the Maranello team from 2010; a Spanish driver would please the sponsors no-end.The Italian Team however denies that such a move is on the cards - although this does not necessarily rule out the possibility, with driver line-up announcements at the Scuderia traditionally kept secret until later on in the season."[Whitmarsh] can say what he wants, there is no 'Fernando-Ferrari move',' said an unnamed Italian team spokesperson, according to BBC.Should the rumours prove to be correct, an extremely interesting combination could be on the cards. Autosport magazine have speculated that Michael Schumacher's unwillingness to deny a possible return to the sport could still see him return to competitive racing in F1 in 2010.  When asked about a possible return, Schumacher said: "Speculation in this business is pretty natural. Lots of people have their own opinions and thoughts but the fact of the matter is that I'm very disappointed not to do what I was looking to do."Elsewhere in the paddock, very few driver positions have been confirmed, with the exception of Red Bull who have confirmed the status quo of Vettel and Webber for next year, and Timo Glock, for whom it was confirmed that he would be staying at Toyota earlier in the year.The 109th running of the world's oldest annual marathon, the Boston Marathon, will start in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, at noon on Monday, April 18, 2005. The marathon, one of the few marathons that requires entrants to run below certain times in another marathon to enter, is "tough for the runners" because of the late start time, the Monday start date, and the remote start location, according to Don Allison of Cool Running. Despite the entry requirements and hardships, the marathon is expected to draw over 20,000 runners, 500,000 spectators, and 1000 members of the press.Race director Dave McGillivray told the Boston Globe that, "We're not the fastest course, we're not the biggest field, we're not the richest purse, but we're the most prestigious." The Globe notes that the Chicago marathon is known for faster times, a purse 50% larger than Boston's, and a field twice as large. Still, in Boston the winning man and woman each receive $100,000 in prize money.The Boston Marathon is know for the set of 4 hills that runners hit in Newton, a suburb west of Boston. The fourth hill, known as Heartbreak Hill, occurs at the 21-mile mark.Dinamo Moscow came into agreement with FC Porto on a deal bringing two stars of Portugal's national team, Maniche and Costinha into the Russian club. Their transfer cost was 16 and 4 million euros respectively, making this the most expensive transfer deal in Russian football. The head of Dinamo's board of directors, Alexey Fedorychev, is among the wealthiest Russian businessmen and he is responsible for making the money available to the club. Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.Meanwhile, in a Russian Premier League match Saturday with Amkar Perm Dinamo Moscow suffered its fourth defeat in a row 1-2, dropping to 9th place. Amkar (one of the poorest teams in Premier League) on the other hand, won the second match in a row. Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either. It is yet to be seen, whether the new signings can help the club join the ranks of the top RPL teams, such as Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow.Russia's Interior Ministry confirmed yesterday that the police will enforce the law banning "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations" during the 2014 Winter Olympics to be held in Sochi in February.The statement said "law enforcement agencies can have no qualms with people who harbour a nontraditional sexual orientation" so long as they do not promote homosexuality to minors, "do not conduct any kind of provocation and take part in the Olympics peacefully."The statement continued: "Any discussion on violating the rights of representatives of nontraditional sexual orientations, stopping them from taking part in the Olympic Games or discrimination of athletes and guests of the Olympics according to their sexual orientation is totally unfounded and contrived."Alexander Zhukov, the deputy Prime Minister and head of the Russian Olympics Committee told the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti: "If a person does not put across his views in the presence of children, no measures against him can be taken. People of nontraditional sexual orientations can take part in the competitions and all other events at the games unhindered, without any fear for their safety whatsoever."The International Olympics Committee stated last week they would seek clarification from the Russian government after calls from gay activists to relocate the event.Last week, British actor Stephen Fry wrote an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron arguing the Winter Games ought to be relocated, and Russian President Vladimir Putin "is making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did Jews". Fry argued "[anti-gay] beatings, murders and humiliations are ignored by the police. Any defence or sane discussion of homosexuality is against the law."Fry attended a protest in London on Saturday against the Russian laws on homosexuality. At the protest he said: "All homophobic regimes say this — they say they do it for the children. They do this to stop children being propogandised at by gay people. That's not the situation at all. What they have done is unleashed thugs who have done unspeakable things to teenagers, lured them, beaten them, humiliated them, tortured them. This continues to be the case."On Twitter, David Cameron responded to Fry's call for a relocation of the Games: "Thank you for your note @stephenfry. I share your deep concern about the abuse of gay people in Russia. However, I believe we can better challenge prejudice as we attend, rather than boycotting the Winter Olympics."Lord Sebastian Coe, head of the British Olympic Association, also rejected the call for a boycott or relocation: "only damage one group of people, and that is the athletes. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, but not an issue that is one of a boycott."Coe also argued the Olympics and other sporting events help promote social change: "International sport is not an inhibitor of social change, it actually has quite strong catalytic effects. I am a profound believer that the relationships developed through international sport are often in the infancy of social change."U.S. President Barack Obama has also rejected a call for a boycott. At a press conference at the White House last week, he stated: "I want to just make very clear right now: I do not think it’s appropriate to boycott the Olympics[...] We’ve got a bunch of Americans out there who are training hard, who are doing everything they can to succeed. Nobody’s more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and -lesbian legislation that you’ve been seeing in Russia."As of Monday, over 200 New York City area bars and restaurants had committed to boycotting Russian vodka in response to anti-homosexuality related laws passed by the country's government. The boycott follows another event that took place on Monday where bottles of vodka were poured onto the streets of the city, as part of a protest by the President of United Restaurant and Tavern Owners Association, Paul Hurley.New York One quotes Hurley as saying the reason for the boycott as , "We're not stupid, we're reading papers, we're reading what's going on over there, they've got to stop what's happened."  The press conference announcing the New York City boycott took place at Desmonds Steakhouse located on the 38th Street and 7th Avenue. LGBT activists and models attended the event. Johnny Donovan, manager of J Donovan Productions, is quoted by the New York Daily Times as saying, "Shame on Russia! [...] When I go out to a night club this weekend, I'm not drinking any Russian vodka!"Activists in other cities are also boycotting Russian vodka. A protest at the San Francisco City Hall took place on Tuesday, where vodka was dumped into the sewers. On social media, the hashtag #dumpstoli is being used to draw attention to the boycott and protests.These boycotts are not without criticism. Dodds of Time Magazine points out, "At first glance, Stoli seems a logical target for those hoping to promote greater awareness of the plight of gays in Russia. Not only is it widely associated with the country, vodka is also one of Russia’s most profitable consumer exports to the U.S. [...] But while Stoli’s ingredients — wheat, rye and raw alcohol — are Russian, the vodka itself is distilled in Latvia and distributed in the U.S. by William Grant & Sons USA, an American subsidiary of a Scottish corporation." The international popularity of the brand have resulted in the company being continually threatened with nationalization by the Russian government.Last month, gay and lesbian couples were barred by law from adopting Russian children. The country also banned "homosexual propaganda." The legislation means gays and lesbians, if found guilty of breaking these laws, could be jailed. According to Russia Today, most Russians support the legislation "against promoting homosexuality to minors." Russia Today goes on to say these laws are, "intend[ed] to keep minors from being influenced by non-traditional sexual relationship propaganda and it will be enforced with fines, but not criminal punishment."A Pew Research Center study published in June suggests that attitudes towards homosexuality in Russia found the population to be the least accepting of homosexuals of nine other European countries also surveyed. Countries with less acceptance than Russia included in the survey include Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Senegal and Nigeria.  Negative Russian attitudes towards homosexuality are also supported by research conducted by Russian Levada Center.The homosexuality issue as it pertains to Russian law comes against the backdrop of the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics scheduled to be hosted in the Russian city of Sochi early next year. Last week, Russian Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko reaffirmed the country will enforce these laws during the Games and foreign athletes, journalists and spectators will be subject to them.With day three of the European Deaf Swimming Championships wrapped up on Wednesday in Saransk, Russia, the host nation continues to lead in total number of gold medals awarded.

Belarus was second, with 6 total medals, 5 of which were gold.  Germany was third, with just one medal, which was gold.Welsh footballer Ryan Giggs was named as the 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year in a ceremony Sunday night. The 36-year-old Manchester United and Welsh international player has won a record eleven Premier League titles in his career, and made over 800 appearances for his club.The award is given in December each year to a British sportsman or woman, and is voted for by the public. Giggs is only the fifth footballer to win since the award started in 1954, the most recent being David Beckham in 2001.Formula One driver Jenson Button was runner-up, and heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis came in third.Giggs said that winning came as a shock. "I grew up watching this programme. To see the people that have won it and to be here is unbelievable," he said in his acceptance speech."I am playing for the greatest manager that has ever lived and I'm playing for the greatest club," Giggs said. "Perhaps I've become more appreciated as I have got older. It's unusual for a 36-year-old to be playing with a team like Manchester United for 20 years but I am enjoying it and long may it continue."Through his career United is the only club Giggs has played at. This year he made his 800th appearance and scored his 150th goal, and in April he also won the PFA Player Of The Year award.Seve Ballesteros won the event's Lifetime Achievement award. The Spanish golfer, who is suffering from a brain tumour, was unable to attend the event, but received a standing ovation. His award was presented at his home in Padrena by fellow golfer José María Olazábal."It's a pity I'm not there. I'm very sorry, I know I'm missing a good show, thank you very much to everyone," Ballasteros said.15-year-old diver Tom Daley won Young Sports Personality of the Year for the second time, as well as being one of the ten contenders for the main award. "It's been a good year for me and I would just like to thank everyone who has helped me," Daley said.Comedian Eddie Izzard received a special award for his contributions to the charity event Sport Relief. Earlier this year he completed 43 marathons across the United Kingdom in 51 days, running a total of 1,100 miles. Izzard said that he decided on the challenge as "a health idea". He trained for only five weeks before setting out."Everything was painful. People asked me if I enjoyed the running, but I enjoyed the stopping! I staggered, I ran and I crawled," he admitted when accepting the award. His efforts netted over £200,000 for charity.The awards were presented at the Sheffield Arena, in front of 11,000 people.In their first overtime game ever in the Ontario Hockey League, the Saginaw Spirit ice hockey team won against Sarnia Sting.  The Spirit were also victorious in the first ever shootout at the Dow Event Center.Friday, January 5, 2006 saw the Saginaw Spirit play division rival the Sarnia Sting at the Dow Event Center.  Coming into the contest, the Spirit were in 2nd place in the OHL's West Division with 42 points and the Sarnia Sting were in 5th place with 27 points.The scoring began at 1:15 of the first period with Spirit forward Chris Chappell scoring on a pass from defenseman Steven Whitely.  After goals from defenseman Tyson Gimblett at 8:45 and a power play goal from captain Patrick McNeill at 11:42, the Sting scored their first goal; Chad Painchaud unassisted at 12:12.  Mark Katic followed with a power play goal at 14:22 to make the score 3-2 Spirit at the first intermission.In the second period, the Spirit and Sting exchanged goals.

In last year's regional qualifier for the Little League World Series, the league finished tied for third in their pool and did not advance, but the CNMI team finished second in the Asia Pacific Championship for Senior League World Series.The Aces' victory left them third in league with a record of 6-3, behind the Dandan Comets with a record of 9-0 and JPO Enforcers with a record of 8-1.The Comets beat the Rays on Sunday with a score of 10-0.  Five of their runs came in the first inning alone. The team, sponsored by Rep. Joseph P. Guerrero, ended the game early at the end of the fourth as a result of the mercy rule.

The Braves won the game with three runs in the final inning of the game.London, England — In an interview with Samoa's Chef de Mission at the London Paralympics, Julie Tuala said she hopes to get a powerlifting program under way in Samoa following the London Games.The Samoa Paralympic Committee, she explained, with assistance from the Oceania Paralympic Committee is submitting a grant request to acquire the equipment necessary for a powerlifting program in Samoa; equipment costs around A$18,000 to A$20,000 used, and is specifically built for paraplegic competitors who need to be strapped down when lifting.  If Samoa is successful in getting the money for the equipment, the next challenge will be finding money to cover the cost of freighting it to Samoa. Tuala and the nation's athletics coach have previously held raffles, run events at a golf club, and run bake sales to assist in covering costs for developing disability sport in the country and look to do it again if they can get the grant. The last grant the International Paralympic Committee gave for the region for the equipment did not include Samoa.According to Tuala, equipment costs are a major barrier to participation in the development of disability sport. Samoan London Paralympian Leitu Viliamu needs a new leg as she has outgrown hers.  A high quality leg like the one worn by Oscar Pistorius can cost upwards of AUD$10,000 per leg. Viliamu and fellow Samoan Paralympian Milo Toleafoa only acquired real running shoes for the first time when they arrived in London.Samoa has primarily sent athletics competitors to past Paralympics because of the cost factor.Now San Diego must make sure it doesn't repeat its last performance at New England.That will be especially difficult without an injured L.T., who departed in the first half with a bruised left knee, and starting quarterback Rivers, who went out in the third quarter with a damaged right knee in the Chargers' stunning 28-24 victory Sunday.With Billy Volek at quarterback and Michael Turner as the main runner, San Diego went 78 yards on eight plays, with Volek sneaking in from the 1 with 4:50 remaining for the lead. The Chargers' big-play defense then held on downs at its 7, and stopped Indy again in the final moments to preserve their eighth straight win.To make it nine in a row and advance to their second Super Bowl -- the other was a loss to San Francisco after the 1994 season -- the Chargers will need all the resourcefulness they showed at Indianapolis. Being undermanned against undefeated New England hardly is an enticing prospect.Still, with All-Pro cornerback Antonio Cromartie getting an interception and fumble recovery, and linebackers Shawne Merriman and Shaun Phillips plaguing Peyton Manning, the Chargers showed they have the ability to throw off any offense. Maybe even the most prolific attack in NFL history.The Chargers didn't come close against the Patriots in Week 2, falling 38-14. That was the beginning of a slide to 5-5 for San Diego, but the Chargers (13-5) are rolling now.It was a gutty showing by Rivers, who threw for three scores -- he banged his right knee on a 56-yard screen pass TD by Darren Sproles to end the third quarter. And Turner, who could be a starter elsewhere but usually sits behind league rushing leader Tomlinson, gave the offense the balance it desperately needed in the late stages of the upset, rushing for 71 yards.The Chargers' opportunistic defense, which led the league in takeaways (48) and turnover margin (plus-24), grabbed two interceptions -- both on tipped balls -- and a fumble. While San Diego couldn't stop Manning's offense from steadily marching downfield most of the game, it could make the key plays that get you closer to the Super Bowl.Still, if Tomlinson is limited or sidelined, how much chance do the Chargers have against the perfect Patriots? Not to mention perhaps missing Rivers or tight end Antonio Gates, who courageously played much of the day on a dislocated toe.For the Colts (13-4), it was a bitterly quick elimination from the postseason.A year ago, they won three playoff games, then beat Chicago in the Super Bowl. They couldn't recapture their touch on offense or defense this time, and a defense that allowed the fewest points during the season wore down against the equally physical Chargers.Manning did throw for 402 yards, completing 33 of his 48 throws, but both interceptions killed deep scoring threats.Rivers was 14-of-19 for 264 yards, and Volek went 3-of-4 for 48 yards in his clutch relief role. Vincent Jackson became Rivers' top target and had seven catches for 93 yards and a score.The San Diego Chargers defeated the Indianapolis Colts 26-17 at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. It is the first loss of the season for the Colts, who are the fourth team in NFL history to win their first 13 games.San Diego pulled ahead early, scoring a touchdown and two field goals in the first half. Nate Kaeding kicked a 48-yard field goal in the third period to increase the Chargers' lead to 16 points, but Indianapolis responded with two touchdowns and a field goal in 6 minutes, giving the Colts a 17-16 lead.Kaeding made a 49-yard  field goal to put San Diego up 19-17 in the fourth quarter.  The Colts' ensuing drive ended when rookie Chagers defensive tackle Luis Castillo sacked Colts quarterback Peyton Manning putting Indianapolis out of field goal range. Chargers running back Michael Turner then scored a touchdown on an 83-yard running play, pushing San Diego's lead to 26-17 with two minutes left.The Colts attempted a comeback but Manning was intercepted in the Indianapolis endzone, bringing to an end the game and the Colts' 13-game winning streak.The win means the Chargers remain in close contention with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who won in Minnesota, for an AFC wildcard spot. San Diego and Pittsbugh both have 9-5 records, however the Steelers won their head-to-head matchup which would searve as a tie-breaker. The Colts have already clinched top seed in the AFC."It's tough to go 16-0. You have to play well every week," said Colts coach Tony Dungy. "The only consolation now is that we won't be asked all those questions, have all the media around and we can have more focus on our ultimate goal, to win the Super Bowl." The Colts no longer threaten the record set by the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the last NFL team to boast a perfect season.The Colts (13-1) are in Seattle next Saturday to face the Seahawks (12-2), and the Chargers (9-5) are in Kansas City to play the Chiefs (8-6).The annual draft for the United States and Canadian professional baseball league, Major League Baseball (MLB), started on Tuesday. Stephen Strasburg, a pitcher from San Diego State University, was taken by the Washington Nationals with the first overall pick in the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Strasburg was widely considered to be the top prospect going into the draft.Each year, the First-Year Player Draft is held, allowing MLB teams to select from among the best amateur baseball players in North America. Once selected, a player is obligated to sign a contract with the team that drafts him; if he chooses not to do so, he may not play for any Major League or affiliated Minor League team for one year.Strasburg is expected to sign with the Nationals and play in their farm system this year. The Nationals have held out the chance of promoting him to their MLB roster by September, possibly making him only the third pitcher to be drafted first overall and play in the Majors during the same year. Even before the draft was held, Strasburg was the consensus choice among prognosticators as the likely number-one pick. He has started 15 games this season for the San Diego State Aztecs college baseball team, compiling a record of 13 wins and 1 loss, with a 1.32 earned run average. Strasburg is expected to demand a contract valued at US$50 million; a record for a newly drafted player.The top position player taken was University of North Carolina centerfielder Dustin Ackley, drafted second overall by the Seattle Mariners.John Manuel of Baseball America, writing for SI.com, has graded the Nationals, the Colorado Rockies, and the Minnesota Twins as the best performers on the first day of the draft.The first day of the draft concluded after round 3; overall 111 players were selected on the first day. Rounds 4-30 are expected to be completed Wednesday, and the draft will conclude Thursday after 50 total rounds.Earlier today, San Fermín de los Navarros church in Madrid, Spain celebrated its patron saint day with a small festival in the street outside of and in the courtyard of the church with over two hundred people in attendance.  The patron saint day, San Fermín, marks the start of the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona.The celebration, called "Chupinazo", started in Madrid with a rocket being launched at noon.  Following this, music was played, and sausages from the Navarre region of Spain called Chistorras were given to festival goers.  Free bread and wine were also given out.  Many attendees wore red handkerchiefs adorned with shields of Navarre. The church sold handkerchiefs and other commerative materials, while using the event to solicit funds to fix the roof.The San Francisco Giants defeated the Texas Rangers 3–1 on Monday night, winning the fifth game of the 2010 World Series and clinching the series title. It was the first World Series win for the Giants since 1954, and the first since the team's move from New York City to San Francisco.The Giants had been ahead in the series three games to one coming into Monday's showdown at Rangers Ballpark. In front of a crowd of 52,045, Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum threw for eight innings, while series MVP and shortstop Edgar Rentería hit the game-winning three-run home run in the beginning of the inning. During the World Series, the Colombia native had a batting average of .412, a total of six runs batted in, and two home runs. Rentería also became the fourth player to hit the game-winning run in a World Series twice in a career.The Rangers had never reached the World Series until 2010, but the team struggled. The Rangers had an overall batting average of .190 in the series and did not score for more than 18 consecutive innings before a lone home run in the seventh inning of Monday's game. Texas pitcher Cliff Lee prevented San Francisco from scoring for six innings before Rentería's seventh-inning hit.Sandy Casar of France has won stage 18 of the 2007 Tour de France in a time of 5h 13' 31". Axel Merckx came in second.Sandy Casar, Alex Merckx, Laurent Lefevre, and Michael Boogerd took control of the stage with a break-away that gave them a 10-minute lead on the peleton.Alberto Contador of Spain, who finished with the peleton keeps the yellow jersey. This 211 km long stage, with a few small climbs near the start, was considered by many as the last chance for any surprises.Cadel Evans of Australia, who is second overall, shaved off 3 seconds of the advantage that Contador holds over him, by finishing in a smaller group that finished just ahead of the peleton."I hope I don't lose because of three seconds," said Contador. "This yellow jersey is very important. It's important that I have it tonight. I'm not a time-trial specialist but I'll do all I can not to lose one minute, 50 seconds."Tomorrow's stage is the second time trial stage, with long straight stretches, some beautiful sections of unbending road, some slight inclines and again favours the soloists.

He becomes the first Scottish person to win two golds at the games in thirty-two years — David Wilkie being the last Scot to do so in 1974.The games have presented several surprises thus far — most notably Australia's failure to win more than one gold medal in the men's events up to this point. Matthew John Cowdrey won the sole gold medal for Australia in the 50m freestyle on Saturday. By contrast, the Australian women have had an excellent start so far, with a medal haul of 21 out of a possible 37.South Africa once again demonstrated its strength in men's freestyle swimming by winning the 4 x 100m freestyle relay in 3:14.97, beating the Australian by slightly over half a second. Canada claimed third place.Scottish IndyCar driver Dario Franchitti won his second Indianapolis 500 in four years today after leading 155 laps, which is the fourth most in the 99-year history of the race. Franchitti, aged 37, also won a rain-shortened race in 2007, when the race was stopped after 166 laps due to the inclement weather and he was declared the winner.The conditions at this race were far different, with the National Weather Service reporting temperatures of 88° F (31° C) at the track at race time. This temperature made the race the second hottest to the 1932 race, which reached 92° F. After a failed attempt to race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup series in 2008, Franchitti returned to the IndyCar series to race for Chip Ganassi Racing. With this victory, owner Chip Ganassi became the first team owner in racing history to have their drivers win both the Daytona 500 of the Sprint Cup (won by Jamie McMurray) and the Indianapolis 500 in the same year."The milk tastes just as good the second time around here," said Franchitti, referring to the ceremonial winner's milk drink following the race. "I just needed to know what the other guys were doing with fuel. There was a gap behind them and a lot of confusion. This means so much after coming back when I went away for a year in 2008 and to come back win a championship and win the Indianapolis 500," he added in an interview in the winner's circle.Franchitti won the race on less than a tenth of a gallon of fuel, after he and his team decided to not pit during the final laps of the race. The race ended on a caution after a massive crash between drivers Mike Conway and Ryan Hunter-Reay, when Conway's car got caught onto Hunter-Reay's left outside wheel and was sent airborne. Conway's car then hit the track's retaining wall and landed on its front side. Medics took Conway out of the car, and he was taken to the hospital with a leg injury.Finishing behind Franchitti in second place was British driver Dan Wheldon of Partner Racing. This was Wheldon's second straight second place finish. In third place was Marco Andretti, who started in sixteenth position.The Scottish Football Association has apologised after fans booed the Liechtenstein national team during their national anthem at last night's Euro 2012 qualifier. A section of the Scottish fans started to jeer the anthem due to its similarity to God Save the Queen.Acting chief executive George Peat said in a statement that "I was embarrassed and extremely disappointed by the disgraceful behaviour of some of our supporters during the Liechtenstein national anthem at Hampden Park last night". He added "I apologise unreservedly to our visitors for the crass reaction to their anthem."Scotland defeated Liechtenstein 2-1 to win them three points. Mario Frick scored first for Liechtenstein just after the start of the second half, but Kenny Miller later scored off the bar to equalise the game. In the final minutes of extra time Stephen McManus scored with a header to put Scotland to the top of Group I.Scottish  football team Hibernian F.C. (Hibs) have appointed Pat Fenlon as their new manager. Fenlon signed the contract at Hibs' Easter Road home ground in the capital, Edinburgh. Fenlon left Bohemian F.C., an Irish football team he managed since 2008, so that he could manage Hibernian, which he is "really excited by". Fenlon's management career has previously remained in his native Ireland. From 2002, Fenlon managed Shelbourne F.C., which won the UEFA Cup in three of the five seasons he managed the team for. Fenlon went on to manage Derby City in 2007 before taking the managing position at Bohemians. According to Fenlon, Hibernian are "a club with a rich history and proud traditions." Fenlon's Hibs contract will last until the conclusion of 2013 / 2014 football season.Hibs have now had five managers in as many years. Colin Calderwood is the most recent before Fenlon, being removed from his position on November 6 after twelve months managing the team. In that time they played in forty-nine matches and won in twelve of them. Calderwood has since gone on to become part of Birmingham City F.C., a football team based in the English city of Birmingham.At the end of the previous football season, Hibernian F.C. placed tenth. As it stands, the team are currently ninth in the Scottish Premier League table. In reference to what he called the "quality players on Hibernian's playing staff", Fenlon stated that "there will need to be a lot of hard work and a clear change in mindset shown collectively by the team" and that a major target for them will be "to provide winning football to the Hibernian supporters, who have gone through some hard times recently."Scottish footballer Dave Mackay died in an English hospital on Monday. He was 80."Dave was one of the most influential players of his era[...] a superb player who possessed all the technique, passing ability and talent to be the complete footballer", said Tottenham Hotspur, an English team Mackay played for in the late fifties and early sixties.Mackay's career took him to England after competitive success at Scottish team Hearts, where he was captain. With Hearts he won the Scottish Cup and twice won the Scottish League Cup. He won three FA Cups, one being a 'Double' won in the same year as the English league, with Tottenham Hotspur. He also appeared 22 times playing for the Scottish national side.In the early seventies Mackay turned his attention to managing, taking the top job at various English and Middle Eastern sides. Derby County won the league under him in 1975. Mackay's management career continued until 1995. He has held the title Footballer of the Year in both Scotland and England.Late Manchester United player George Best has previously called Mackay the "hardest man I have ever played against". A minute's applause is planned as tribute when Scotland takes on Northern Ireland at home  on March 25.Scottish football player Phil O'Donnell has died today after collapsing during a game in which his team Motherwell F.C., of which he was captain, were playing Dundee United in a Scottish Premier League match.O'Donnell collapsed as his substitution for Marc Fitzpatrick was being arranged. He received treatment for around five minutes before being stretchered off and transferred to a waiting ambulance. David Clarkson, O'Donnell's nephew, was also playing at the time and had scored twice but was taken off due to being visibly distressed by O'Donnel's collapse.Medics from both teams believed he had suffered a seizure. Attempts were made in the ambulance to revive him, but these failed and he was pronounced dead at 17:18 GMT, having been taken to Wishaw General Hospital.Born on March 25, 1972 O'Donnell made his debut for Motherwell in 1990, and scored the following year in the final of the Scottish Cup, which Motherwell defeated Dundee United 4-3 in. In 1993 he earned his only international cap for Scotland as a substitute in a World Cup qualification match against Switzerland.The following year he was bought by Celtic for £1.75 million ($3.5 million). He stayed with them for five years, after which he was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday. A high number of injuries caused Sheffield Wednesday to release him after four years, and the next year, 2004, then Motherwell manager Terry Butcher awarded him an 18-month contract. In 2006 he was appointed captain, and in April the following year, upon the expiration of his original contract, signed a new one as a player-coach.Motherwell chairman Bill Dickie said "Unfortunately I can confirm very, very sad news that Phil O'Donnell has lost his life. We don't know what it was, but there will be a post-mortem. This is a tragic happening and that's all I can say."Motherwell owner John Boyle told the press "Everyone at Motherwell is shocked to the core, and we are sure that everyone involved in Scottish football will feel the same. Phil was not only an inspirational player for Motherwell and club captain, but was an inspirational person. All of us at Motherwell are thinking of his wife Eileen and their four children."Mark McGhee, manager of the team, said "I don't want to say anything more than how devastated everyone at the club is for his wife and his young children. That's what we are all feeling tonight, nothing else matters. Obviously from the club's point of view, we'll gather round to give his family as much support as they need." In a press conference given at the hospital, Motherwell chief executive Ian Stillie said "The management, directors, players and fans are all stunned and having great difficulty in comprehending what has happened over the last few hours. At this stage we do not have all the facts surrounding the tragic death of Phil O'Donnell. We have been in contact with Phil's wife Eileen and his family and they have given us their blessing to speak to the media tonight. Phil collapsed during the second half of the game today. He was standing alone at the time. He was immediately attended to by Motherwell's club doctor and assisted by Dundee United's club doctor. He was transferred almost immediately to an awaiting ambulance and taken to Wishaw General. It is believed Phil suffered some form of seizure and was pronounced dead at 1718." Gordon Smith, Scottish Football Association chief executive, told reporters "This is absolutely devastating news. Phil was not just a wonderful footballer, he was a great human being. My thoughts are with his family at this tragic time." Meanwhile, Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said "When the news came through, everyone at the club was obviously shocked. Our thoughts are with his family to whom we offer extreme condolences for a tragic loss of a young life. Everyone at Celtic Park will mourn him."The first Old Firm Derby of the 2007-08 Scottish Premier League ended in a 3-0 victory for Rangers over Celtic.The result brings the two clubs level on points at the top of the table, although Rangers are ranked second on goal difference.The first chance of the match fell to Celtic when Scott McDonald, who played as a lone striker, tried an overhead kick which went wide. However Rangers took the lead when Nacho Novo headed a goal just inside the half hour mark. Barry Ferguson scored Rangers' second goal soon after half time, while Novo scored a penalty to add their third with ten minutes remaining.Rangers manager Walter Smith had claimed last season's derby victories over Celtic meant nothing, because Celtic were already Scottish champions in theory. This result could determine if Rangers win the championship, but Smith said that there was a "long way to go" before the title could be decided. Celtic manager Gordon Strachan said that his side had failed to take the chances they made.Celtic challenged Rangers' lead at the top of the SPL with a 5-0 thumping of Hearts in reply to Rangers' 7-2 thrashing of Falkirk last Saturday.After ten minutes, Shunsuke Nakamura's off-target volley hit Christophe Berra's arm and flew into the Hearts net. 15 minutes later,  Massimo Donati took on two Hearts defenders before sliding home the second. Scott Brown hit home a third 65 minutes in, 1 minute later, Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink scored the fourth from the penalty spot and Nakamura curled in the fifth on the 79 minute mark. Chris Killen had a good shot saved by the dispirited Hearts goalkeeper, Steve Banks.In the Scottish Premier League (SPL), Kilmarnock F.C. defeated Hibernian F.C. 2-1 on Saturday. Nine minutes into the game in Rugby Park, Kilmarnock, Scotland, Liam Kelly became the first player of the game to score for Kilmarnock. He achieved a second goal for his team 43 minutes after the game commenced.In the second half of the match on the snow-covered field, Derek Riordan scored one goal for his team Hibernian at 55 minutes, which was also his 100th career goal for the team. Liam Miller of Hibernian was given a red card after clipping Conor Sammon 80 minutes into the game. Referee Craig Thomson decided this rulebreaking occurred immediately outside of the penalty area.Kilmarnock's position in the SPL table now increases to fifth. Meanwhile, Hibernian remain at ninth. Colin Calderwood, the Hibernian manager, said of the match "[w]e've always got to be aware that [Kilmarnock] have got something to protect and we've got nothing to lose", in an interview available on the BBC Sport website. "The attitude and the sort of tempo of how we're going about it in the second half is just sort of the place in the right direction where I feel we've gotta go."In a separate BBC Sport interview, Kilmarnock manager Mixu Paatelainen commented: "I thought for the first half we were excellent. You know, the surface was quite tricky today because it was a little bit snowy and the ball skids along but, you know, that possibly helped our passing game. You know, [Liam Kelly] was sharp, he was quick, he passed round players and he scored two excellent goals. The second half was a little bit stickier for us, owing to Hibs. They're a good team. They put us under pressure but, you know, thankfully our defence did their job and we only conceded one goal which was a fantastic strike from Riordan."A Scottish university is investigating after several dozen members of its football club reportedly used blackface as part of costuming for a social event yesterday. Representatives from the University of Stirling, located in central Scotland, has said it has "zero-tolerance" for racism and is "disappointed that the actions of a few are tarnishing the [university's] reputation". Stirling University F.C. yesterday tweeted about its intention to hold what it called an "African cup of nations" themed event that evening, although the tweet was later deleted. That evening, a group of people said to be from the team reportedly arrived at Cape, a bar in Stirling, wearing football kits, their faces and limbs covered black. Website The Tab accompanies its report with pictures of several men who appear to be covered in black makeup and quotes one man, Jim MacIvor, describing witnessing "30–40 blacked up footballers having a drink", socialising, "being quite boisterous [...] [and] quite drunk — and some of them were taking their tops off and stuff like that." The website also shared video of members of the public confronting some of the men in the group and accusing them of racism.The Tab, which in publicising its article described the incident as "so cringe", has prompted debate among Facebook users as to whether or not the football club members' actions amount to racism. A spokesperson for Show Racism the Red Card, a charity advocating for anti-racism education, said: "The practice of blacking up was usually as part of a show by white entertainers for white audiences which relied on mocking black people’s skin colour and culture; the practice is racist and should definitely be avoided in our more enlightened times." Previously, the same charity has said "it is the consequences of the practice rather than the intention that is relevant; what does black-face say to people, and young people particularly about the acceptance and normality of different skin colours in society? Show Racism the Red Card would argue that these practices caricature and exoticise differences which could lead to discrimination."The university has suspended four of its football teams from any football-related activities as the investigation continues. In a joint statement, Professor John Gardner, Deputy Principal for Education and Students, and student union president Amy McDermott, said the university is investigating the incident. "The university and the Students’ Union have a zero-tolerance approach to racism and will respond robustly to any behaviour that does not meet with our values and expectations", their statement said. "We are committed to promoting equality and diversity so that all students, staff and members of society can be confident that they will be treated with dignity and respect.  We promote equality and diversity through a variety of policies and initiatives, including the ‘One Stirling’ campaign, which outlines our commitment to these values. We are disappointed that the actions of a few are tarnishing the reputation of the University of Stirling, and we wish to reassure students that a full investigation is underway and disciplinary action will be taken against any student found to have engaged in racist behaviour."Upon contacting Gardner and McDermott, as well as Sports President Chris Priddle, to enquire further about the incident, the university reiterated to Wikinews the comments made in the above statement.The San Diego State University (SDSU) and Brigham Young University (BYU) football game, originally scheduled for October 27, 2007 in San Diego, has been postponed until December 1. Qualcomm Stadium, home of the SDSU Aztecs, is currently housing 12,000 evacuees from the Southern California wildfires.In addition to the housing of evacuees at the stadium, the decision to postpone the game was made for several other reasons. Federal and state declarations of a state of emergency; air quality; transportation considerations; closure of SDSU; student-athlete well-being; fan safety; and competitive equity, all played a role. Mountain West Conference commissioner Craig Thompson said, "There is a far greater priority than sporting events in the San Diego area at this time. The focus should be on emergency response and resources, and getting the community back on its feet. Our thoughts are with our colleagues at San Diego State University, as well as everyone who has been affected by this disaster."Belconnen, Australian Capital Territory — The Canberra Capitals Academy won 71–68 against the Bendigo Braves Saturday in the Round 16 South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) game at the Belconnen Basketball and Sports Centre.

By the following day, all 21 were dead.  The proximate cause of death was reported to be acute pulmonary edema.  All 21 horses were part of Lechuza Caracas polo team and the team captain said all of them had been injected with Biodyl, a vitamin and mineral supplement for animals that is manufactured in France.  Five other team horses, not injected, were not affected.Initially the focus of the US media was on the possibility that the horses died due to the use of performance enhancing drugs in sport, while the focus of the Argentine media was on the possibility of sabotage of a powerful sports team.  However, it soon emerged that the horses may have died due to an error by a Florida pharmacy.On Monday, German football club Borussia Dortmund announced the signing of 25-year-old midfielder Sebastian Rode from Bayern Munich on a four-year deal.

In the first event of the morning, the Women Super-G Visually Impaired final, Russian Alexandra Frantseva and guide Pavel Zabotin won the gold.

She stood alongside secretary general of FIFA Jérôme Valcke, Blatter and soccer greats including Uruguayan Alcides Ghiggia during the draw. FIFA claims they were not involved in the selection of Lima's attire.New York Daily News writer Frank Isola said his favorite moment of the draw was when Ghiggia dropped a ping-pong ball and Lima in her dress retrieved it.Casey Stoney, who was captain of the English women's football team in the last Olympics told the Sunday Telegraph: "Giving the job to a model has sent out completely the wrong message. Unfortunately I wasn't surprised. [...] They could have had a woman high up in the game or else a player with proper international standing. This should have been about football." BBC broadcaster Jacqui Oatley, the first woman to be a  Match of the Day commentator for the network, is quoted by the Sunday Telegraph as saying, "What a missed opportunity. Brazil have arguably the most talented female footballer in the world, the great Marta, five-time FIFA World Player of the Year. Why not use her to showcase the best of Brazil and show some of her spectacular goals?"Live coverage of the draw in Iran cut away every time Lima was in shot because her clothes did not comport with Iranian customs.Blatter has a history of making remarks that have been perceived as sexist, including a 2004 comment that suggested female players could get more fans by wearing tighter uniforms.Christiano Jorge Santos, a Sao Paulo state prosecutor, announced prior to the draw he planned an investigation into FIFA and event organizer GEO Eventos following the related accusations of racism stemming from the selection of Lima as a presenter.  Suggestions were made that Lima was chosen because she was white.After equalizing with Zeta (1:1), the leader of Serbia and Montenegro, Partizan Belgrade, secured first place in the First Federal League.

The first set lasted only 30 minutes, and Sharapova broke Azarenka's serve to go ahead 4-3 in the second set and closed it out with an ace. For Sharapova, who improves to 22-4, it was her first Women's Tennis Association title of the year and 25th of her career. Azarenka had won the four previous matches against Sharapova.

Azarenka falls to 29-2 on the year, and suffered a wrist injury at the start of the second set that limited her playing ability. She will, however, maintain her No. 1 world ranking."I am really pleased to win such a tough tournament, against such tough opponents," said Sharapova, before collecting the white sports car donated by the sponsor.

I was really happy to come to Stuttgart and I hope to do better next year."This event marked Radwanska's fifth loss of the year, all of which have come while playing against Azarenka. Sharapova earned roughly €87,000 (US$115,000) and a brand new white Porsche 911 sports car for this victory.Defending Wimbledon Ladies Singles champion Maria Sharapova has been beaten by Venus Williams in the 2005 semi-final by two sets to love.  In the final game, Williams came to match point twice, just as rain began to fall.  Both that and the preceding game were hard fought, with a succession of deuces.The other semi-final, between Amelie Mauresmo and Lindsey Davenport, will resume tomorrow after rain forced an early end to play today. The match will resume with Davenport a break up in the final set. The previous sets both went to tie-breaks after both players exchanged breaks of serve.Both matches were played at the same time - Williams and Sharapova on Centre Court, with Davenport and Mauresmo on No.1 - after early rain meant players could not get onto the courts until late afternoon.19-year old Maria Sharapova won her first US Open title, defeating Belgium's Justine Henin-Hardenne 6-4, 6-4 in the Saturday final.

She also commented that "This is an amazing honor."She continued by crediting tennis great Billie Jean King for "just being an amazing woman."Henin-Hardenne also reached all four Grand Slam finals in 2006, yet only took the French Open title home.Sheffield United have been relegated from the English Npower Football League Championship, after a 2-2 home draw to Yorkshire rivals Barnsley at Bramall Lane on Saturday, their 45th game of the season. Though United's fate had been all but sealed in recent weeks, they could mathematically taken the relegation battle to the final day if the match had been won - and the results of rivals Doncaster Rovers and Crystal Palace had gone their way.Despite pre-season hopes of a play-off place, 'The Blades' have been stuck in a fight for Championship survival for the majority of the season, which has been the result of three managerial changes in the period of just 8 months. Currently lead by former Port Vale F.C. boss (and a childhood United fan), Micky Adams, results have continued to be generally poor in 2011 - despite the departure of  Gary Speed (who took over from Kevin Blackwell in August 2010, but left after just 4 months to coach Wales national football team).The South Yorkshire football club controversially began a legal dispute with London-based West Ham United F.C. in 2007 following The Football Association's (FA) decision not to deduct Sheffield's relegation rivals  points for ineligibly fielding Carlos Tévez (which subsequently  lead to Sheffield United's relegation from the top flight of English football). Since then, numerous attempts to return to the Barclays Premier League have been unsuccessful, including a play-off final hosted at Wembley in 2009.Speaking after today's game, a downhearted Micky Adams remarked: "I'm obviously devastated. There's a lot of disappointed players in the changing rooms today and I think they have every right to be disappointed. The team's a genuine hard-working group but they've just not been good enough. We have to share responsibility and I'll take mine".Adams admitted he "can't say" whether he will still be in charge next season, though was adamant that he "wants to be the manager who brings them [United] back".United will play in the Npower League 1 for the 2011/12 football season. As this was not Sheffield's last game of the campaign, the club could still move down to 23rd place, but cannot achieve a place outside the relegation zone.Perhaps ironically, this event comes almost a year after cross-city rivals Sheffield Wednesday were relegated from the same division, meaning that next season will host the first Steel City Derby in the third tier of English football since 1980.Sherpa mountaineer Nawang Gombu, 79, the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest twice, died Sunday morning at his home in Darjeeling, India, located at the base of the Himalayas, his family reported.Gombu was born in Tibet but later moved with his family to a small village in Nepal near Mount Everest.  When he was about 21, Gombu reached the South Col as the youngest member of Sir Edmund Hilary's team in 1953. On that expedition, Hilary and Tenzing Norgay, Gombu's uncle, were the first to successfully scale Mount Everest. Gombu set another record as the first person to reach the mountain's summit twice, first in 1963 with Jim Whittaker on an American expedition and again in 1965 with Captain Awarae Singh Cheema on an Indian expedition.He scaled many other Himalayan peaks including Makalu, Nanda Devi and Cho Oyu, and is credited with discovering several new mountain routes.Gombu was one of the "Tigers of the Snow", Sherpa mountain climbers who brought recognition to their their ethnic community in the mountains of Tibet and Nepal.He was important in the formation of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI), along with other Sherpas. The creation of the Institute was supported by Nehru. Gombu served as Director of Field Training there after Norgay retired from the role, eventually retiring from HMI himself after more than forty years of work for the Institute."He was not only an outstanding climber, Gombu was a fine person who guided Indian mountaineering to a greater height," said Mohan Singh Kohli, a retired Navy captain and leader of the 1965 Indian  expedition. "Gombu’s death left a big void in the adventure field of the country."For his work, Gombu received many awards, including medals from  Queen Elizabeth II and the National Geographic Society, and was invited to the White House by President Kennedy.Korean Jiyai Shin played a faultless final round to win the HSBC Women's Champions in Singapore at the Tanah Merah Country Club. Starting the final day six shots behind the overnight leader of, Katherine Hull, Shin birdied the first four holes to close the gap quickly.Shin who is ranked 4th in the world takes home a purse of US$300,000.Shin showed class and poise to seal the championship with her approach shot on the 18th. Playing from 180 yards on the par 4, Shin found the green with comfort and was left with a 30 foot putt to seal victory. Despite running her putt well past the hole, Shin sunk the putt to par and finish with 6 under for the day and 11 under for the tournament.The championship took an interesting turn midway through the final round when Katherine Hull boogied the 10th hole and then two holes later followed with another bogey. Seemingly shaken from two lost shots early on the back nine, Hull then found trouble left on the 14th fairway and had to take an unplayable lie and consequently double-boogied. These two holes took Hull from at one point a four shot lead to suddenly being level with Shin who was gaining in confidence each hole.Hull managed a birdie on the 17th and still in contention to force a play-off should Shin falter. Hull’s final tee-shot again showed the difficulties she had been experiencing all day and pushed it right forcing another drop and effectively ending her chances. Hull finished with another boogie and 74 for the final round. Behind Hull and Shin there was a series of interesting battles for the minor placings with Paula Creamer scoring birdie on the 16th and 17th holes and then finding trouble on her first shot on the 18th effectively ending her chance of staging an unlikely win. Her recovery from the bunker still left her short of the green and eventually finishing with a boogie and 8 under for the tournament in equal 3rd place.World number one rated player, Mexican Lorena Ochoa, never troubled the leaders after winning last years HSBC championship and also winning last week at the tour of Thailand. Ochoa finished in sixth place with a final score of seven under. Her chance of scoring back-to-back wins faded with a disappointing second round of 73.Another player who found difficulties in finishing the final round was Sun Young Yoo who boogied three consecutive hole starting at the 13th dropping her from second place to eighth. Yoo scored a much needed birdie on the 17th to finish tied for sixth with Jane Park and Lorena OchoaHSBC Womens Championship Final StandingsLondon, England —  When Mohamed Kamara enters the Olympic Stadium during the 2012 Summer Paralympics Opening Ceremony on Wednesday night representing Sierra Leone, he will become only the second Paralympic competitor to ever represent his country.

Didier Drogba scored again for the visitors (Chelsea) in the 79th minute. United's Federico Macheda scored a goal two minutes later. The victory took Chelsea two points ahead of their rivals with five matches in hand for both teams.Replays of Drogba's goal showed that the striker was offside. In connection to this, the Manchester United manager commented, "What I can't understand is the linesman's directly in front of it. He has no-one near him and he gets it wrong." He added: "A game of that magnitude, you really need quality officials and we didn't get them today. It was a poor, poor performance."According to Ferguson, Chelsea were the title favorites for this season. "Five games left, they're two points ahead and four goals better than us - they're in the driving seat," he said. "Chelsea are favourites now, there's no question. I'm certain we'll respond but we could win the next five games and not win it," he added.Chelsea manager, Carlo Ancelotti said that his team "kept a high intensity" in the first half of the match. "We had good control of the game. We trained very well during the week because we didn't have a Champions League match. You lose a lot of energy. We played very well in the first half. It's a very important victory for us and a very important performance. To win here is not easy, we did a good job," he further commentedAncelotti left out Drogba from the starting team and chose the team that defeated Aston Villa 7-1 last week. "It was very tough to take out Didier but he understood because he trained not 100 per cent during the week. I preferred to put him on during the match and he did very well because he was fresh and he scored a fantastic goal," the Italian said.Ancelotti agreed that Chelsea were favorites. He said it was normal as they were back at top of the league standings. "There are five games left and we have to stay focused. We are happy but nothing is decided so we must stay calm and focused on our game. [It has been a] good reaction after the defeat against Inter. My players are strong," he noted.Florent Malouda of Chelsea said that it was going to be very difficult to win the championship. "If we play the way we played today, we have a big possibility but it's going to be very, very hard," he said.According to him, Chelsea "wanted to be on top of the league after this game." He told Sky Sports that "it was hard but I think we played really well and for us it means a lot after the bad week we had. We had to react and we reacted in the best way."Morwell have moved into second spot after a 37 point victory over Traralgon in their round 12 Gippsland Football League clash.Traralgon led at the end of both the first and second quarters before Morwell kicked nine goals to three in the second half to record a 15-17 (107) to 9-16 (70) victory.Morwell now sit in second place 1.46% ahead of Traralgon with Maffra two games ahead on top.

The battle for bronze in the women's single class 3 match ended with Kanova winning by 3 sets to 1 to take the medal.Head took an early lead, winning the first set 11–2 before going down to Kanova in the second set by 5–11.  Head kept the scoring closer in the third set at 4–7 at one point, before losing 5–11.  The British fans dominated Slovakia in terms of volume, chanting "G-B! G-B!" in support of their player, with the occasional shout of "Go Sara!".  The Slovaks ruled the stands in terms of waving large flags. A loud chant from Great Britain's fans stopped abruptly after Kanova scored. Head could not come back in the fourth set, losing 3–11 and seeing Kanova take the bronze.In the gold medal match on the main table, Austria's Doris Mader lost to Sweden's Anna-Carin Ahlquist, with Ahlquist receiving loud support from her teammates and coaches.

The game was the last one in pool play for both teams and China left the game at the top of their group in group play.With spectators equaling half the total who watched the Great Britain versus Ukraine match earlier at the Games, China won the first set 25–12 before a crowd full of home town fans.  In the press area, volunteers assisting with the games — so-called Games Makers — outnumbered the press, which included three Slovenes and Wikinews at the start, before they were joined by a trio of Chinese reporters who showed up half way through the first set.  The limited partisan support available for one of the teams on the court was found in the corner, and the Slovenes were waving their flag during time outs and when Slovenia scored.China went on to win the second set 24–15, with the Slovenes able to fight back and narrow the score at times but never seriously challenge the Chinese lead. A Chinese supporter with a flag made their presence known during Slovenia's second time out in the second set by waving it when asked which side fans were supporting.The Slovenes were in it early in the third set, only behind 5–4 at one point before leveling at 6–6 and going ahead 6–7, which was their first lead of the game.  With Slovenia holding a lead of 7–8, a long volley followed which ended with Slovenia celebrating a point only for it to be awarded to China, which tied the score again and China came back for scores to sit at 13–8. At this point, Slovenia called their second time out.  The relatively quiet audience only got loud with commentator direction.  While two Chinese flags waved during timeouts, the Chinese media who showed up midway through the first set left the press tribunes by midway through the third set.  The Slovenes attempted to stay in it, but ended the set 25–16.Entering the tournament as the number-one ranked team in the world, China came into the game having beaten the United States in their opening game 3 sets to 1, then going on to beat Brazil by the same total. In contrast, the Slovenes who are ranked fifth in the world went down to the United States 0 to 3 in straight sets, then down to Brazil by 2 sets to 3.Other sitting volleyball games scheduled today include men's games with Great Britain playing Germany, Bosnia and Herzegovina playing Rwanda, and Iran playing Brazil, women's games with the Ukraine playing Japan, the United States playing Brazil.Pakistani military agreed to help in the rescue mission of Slovenian alpinist Tomaž Humar. Humar was on his paramount course mission on the 4700 meter high south rock wall of the 8125 meter high Nanga Parbat mountain (the utmost west of the mountain chain) in the Himalaya mountains, being trapped in the ice-hole at an approximate height of 5900 meters for five days. The rescue mission with the military helicopter is planned for Monday morning local time, August 8, 2005.The rescue team managed to locate Humar on face on Sunday, but said they need a better helicopter for the actual rescue mission.

He was 27.Hunter announced on April 6, 2005 that he was suffering from neuroendocrine tumours, a rare form of cancer. He died in a hospice in Huddersfield five days short of his 28th birthday. He is survived by his wife, Lyndsey, and a daughter, Evie Rose.United States of America snowmobile racer Caleb Moore died Thursday morning at age 25 after he had been seriously injured in an accident during the Winter X Games XVII. It was the first fatal injury in the X Games history. The investigation of the accident has started, and the ESPN television channel that organizes the games said it will reassess the security measures during the snowmobile competitions.Seven days ago in Aspen, Colorado, Moore attempted a backflip with his snowmobile. He lost control of the machine in the landing, crashed and the snowmobile rolled over him. Although he was able to leave the scene on his own feet, he was still transported to a hospital where serious complications emerged, including internal bleeding around his heart and a brain injury. Moore died in a hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado.ESPN said in a statement: "We are deeply saddened by Caleb Moore's passing and our thoughts and prayers go out to (...) the entire Moore family." According to the statement, Moore was injured attempting a trick he had successfully completed many times before. The organizers promised to make proper changes to ensure the safety in future, but they still admit there will always be a risk in competitions of top athletes.There has already been critics of the dangerous core of X Games. "As I watched these athletes fly over my head, it really hit home just how miraculous the zero-casualty rate was," sports writer Brent Rose wrote in his commentary to Deadspin just a few hours before the news of Moore's death was published. The X Games are a big and successful business for the ESPN. More than 35 million people in the United States watched the broadcasting this year.Moore has won four medals in his X Games career since 2010. He had a younger brother, Colten Moore, a fellow snowmobile racer. Colten was injured in the same event in a different accident, but was not seriously injured.The International Olympic Committee awarded the XXII Winter Olympics, to be held in 2014, to Sochi, Russia, a resort city near the Black Sea, in Guatemala City yesterday defeating Pyeongchang, South Korea, by just four votes. Salzburg, Austria, was eliminated in the first round by 25 votes.According to the Associated Press, several factors played a part in Sochi's win. One factor was that of Russian president Vladimir Putin himself. Putin, an avid skier and a black belt in judo, traveled to Guatemala to lobby IOC members and headed up the final presentation of Sochi's bid to the assembly. "Putin being here was very important, he worked very hard at it. He was nice. He spoke French -- he never speaks French. He spoke English -- he never speaks English," said French IOC member and former ski champion Jean-Claude Killy. Patrick Hickey, an Irish member of the IOC agreed. "There's no doubt that President Putin's presence was a massive influence, his performance was superb. He was humble. He spoke in English and French. The second most powerful man in the world said everything will be delivered."Juan Antonio Samaranch, former IOC president and Spanish ambassador to Russia made a big push for Sochi, which may have swung some key votes according to some IOC members."This is, without doubt, not just a recognition of Russia's sporting achievements but it is, beyond any doubt, a judgment on our country, it is a recognition of our growing capability, first of all economically and socially," Putin stated upon his return to Russia. Another factor is Russia's brand new wealth from exports of Russian natural gas and oil, which provided over $12 billion for Putin to invest in the Games and the infrastructure around Sochi.Russia last hosted the games in 1980 in Moscow, when the country was known as the Soviet Union. The games were boycotted by the United States and some of its allies over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.The United States continues to spar with Russia over human rights abuses and the subjugation of democratic freedoms.U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack spoke in Washington to reporters stating, "Well, it's a proud moment for Russia and I am sure it's a proud moment for him so he can characterize it as he sees fit, I'm not sure that the selection of Russia to host the Winter Olympics really, at this point, changes our view or others' views -- or concerns -- about the direction of democracy and related issues: human rights, respect for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and to be able to peaceably organize opposition democratic parties."Meanwhile, Sochi has announced that progress of construction on venues in Sochi will be offered online. Dmitri Chernyshenko, Sochi 2014's bid leader said, "The IOC will be online every single moment in terms of construction, there will be live video from all construction sites."The next Olympic bid is for the 2016 Summer Olympics which includes bids from Chicago, Tokyo, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Doha, Baku, and Prague.Hawker, Canberra — Last night at the Hawker International Softball Centre, Softball Australia, the Australian Sport Commission and the Federal Government through Andrew Leigh reaffirmed their support of indigenous softball, the most popular sport for indigenous women.Their support was part of a number of activities to celebrate indigenous softball prior to the start of two games between the Aussie Spirit and the Japan women's national softball team including a demonstration game between youth teams from the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, a cultural performance, and several speakers including Leigh, an Aboriginal elder from the Ngunnawal tribe, and a representative from the Australian Sport Commission.All speakers paid tribute to the traditional landowners.Leigh was at the event on behalf of Kate Lundy who was unable to attend because of additional duties as a result of her ministerial portfolio increasing. He said the federal government was committed to making softball the sport of choice for the indigenous community as sport helps keep people fit.  After his speech, he was presented with a bat painted by an Aboriginal artist. The speaker from the Australian Sport Commission echoed Leigh's message, saying one of their goals was to see more Australian Aboriginal membership on Australian national teams.Indigenous competitors represent Australia at the highest level in softball, with two aboriginal players on the Australia women's national softball team, Vanessa Stokes and Stacey Porter, and one aboriginal player on the Australian men's national softball team, Jeff Goolagong.Softball Australia has made a commitment to indigenous Australian involvement, not just player participation, but in leadership roles, with 183 indigenous Australians involved in these roles across all levels of Softball Australia. Everyone is involved in increasing participation across gender lines, and in the coming year, they will support over one hundred programs for the community.The game was also attended by Japan's ambassador to Australia.  Leigh threw the ceremonial first pitch for the game.Louise Straw, a solicitor representing UK television and radio presenter Stuart Hall, has said Hall is innocent of charges of indecent assault. In relation to complaints about alleged events between 1974 and 1984 involving three females between eight and seventeen years of age, Hall was charged with three counts of indecent assault after being arrested Wednesday.Hall, who has been released on bail, is expected to appear at Preston Magistrates' Court on January 7.Saying Hall was not able to provide any additional comment at present, Straw criticised the apparent "systematic, measured leaks to the media, which have given a misleading impression of what this case is about." She stressed it was "a matter of concern" given the recent release of the Leveson Report. Straw also said because police arrested Hall at his residence in the town of Wilmslow in Cheshire, he "was not afforded the opportunity to attend voluntarily at the police station. In due course, the decision that he should be arrested will be the subject of some scrutiny".John Dilworth of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was "sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and ... it is in the public interest to prosecute this case." Stating Hall was innocent, Straw explained: "There will be a trial and his defence will then be in the public domain."Hall — who has recently been featuring as an association football commentator on BBC Radio 5 Live — will not be working at the BBC as police inquiries continue because of "the very serious nature of these charges", a spokesperson for the corporation has said.Hall, who notably presented UK game show It's a Knockout, was given an OBE at the New Year Honours for services to charity and broadcasting. His broadcasting career has lasted some fifty years.The Globe and Mail (Toronto, ON), citing sources close to both sides in the dispute, reported Wednesday that the National Hockey League and the NHLPA have agreed to a salary cap structure, arguably the most contentious issue in the continuing lockout that led to the cancellation of the 2004-05 NHL season on 16 February, 2005.The Globe and Mail is reporting that the deal, providing the "cost certainty" that the NHL has been seeking, will consist of a floating, team-by-team salary cap and floor based on a percentage of each team's revenue projections. What is being reported as a six-year deal has a salary cap range of $34-36 million and a salary floor of $22-24 million, both hard caps. The new deal will also reportedly include the across-the-board 24% decrease in salary offered by the NHLPA in February. A dollar-for-dollar Luxury tax will also take effect at the halfway point between the lowest salary floor and the highest salary cap (slated to be $29 million for the first year of the deal). Details about what will be done with this money have not been completely worked out, but it is thought that this money will be distributed to teams below the halfway point in such a way as to make sure they remain above the salary hard minimum.While this is one of the most contentious issues in the labor dispute, there are several other issues that may delay the signing of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. These include deciding how high-payroll teams will drop to the new maximum, working on new systems for salary arbitration, free agency, Olympic participation, and drug testing, and to design a complete revenue-sharing system.In the final game of the 2006 Tri Nations Series rugby union tournament, South Africa defeated Australia 24 points to 16 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Despite winning their last two games, South Africa finished third on the table, Australia second, and the All Blacks as winners. The loss for Australia in Johannesburg extends their poor record in South Africa - their last win there was in 2000, and their last win at Ellis Park was over 40 years ago. Fourie du Preez and Breyton Paulse both scored tries for South Africa with Andre Pretorius kicking one conversion, three penalties goals and one drop goal. Stephen Larkham scored Australia's only try and Stirling Mortlock kicking the one conversion and three penalty goals. International rugby continues throughout the rest of the year, with a number of teams involved in 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifying, and  November Tests matches in the northern hemisphere.South Africa convincingly beat Australia by 9 wickets in the second cricket test being played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was the first time Australia has been beaten on home soil since 1992 when the West Indies beat Australia by 2-1 in the five match series. It was a see-sawing game that had both teams appear to be on top at times and only hours later struggling. The turning point came late on day three when Jean-Paul Duminy solidified the South African innings going on to eventually make a personal high score of 166. His partnership of 180 with Dale Steyn, who was dropped three times, became a frustration to Australia.Australia commenced proceedings and was eventually dismissed for 394 in its first innings. The innings finally ended in the first session of day two when Peter Siddle was caught in second slip by de Villiers of a thick edge from a Kallis seamer. It was a sound score after Australia again started slowly losing Mathew Hayden for 8 when the score was 21 continuing a run of bad scores for Hayden this year. Captain Ricky Ponting again was the mainstay of the innings with a hard fought century, finally falling to a catch by Amla of Paul Harris. This was Pontings 38th century and now only three behind Sachin Tendulkar world record. Middle order batsman Michael Clarke struggled early with slow scoring and remained not out on 88 of a 208 balls including only four boundaries and a solitary six for Clarke.South African speedster Dale Steyn again proved his ranking as worlds second best bowler taking five wickets including Simon Katich and Michael Hussey. In the second day morning session he removed Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson in the same over before taking his final wicket of Nathan Hauritz.Steyne finished with 5 for 87 and was well supported by Ntini (2/108) with Kallis, Harris and Morkel each taking one.South Africa's run chase hit trouble with the loss of early wickets in its first innings. The trouble started when Neil McKenzie was bowled by Peter Siddle for a duck in the second over of the day. Amla showed some early promise before playing a loose shot to be caught by Andrew Symonds of the bowling of Mitchell Johnson in the eighth over. South African veteran Jaques Kallis provided support for Smith to carry the score to 109 before being caught behind of Hauritz. Returning from the lunch break Australia took control with three quick wickets in nine overs. First to go was Smith caught behind of Siddle who was gaining in confidence. Only Smith managed to assert control scoring 62 from 113 balls, he has been the mainstay of the South African batting line-up this tour scoring strongly in each innings. Soon after de villiers and Boucher's wickets fell leaving South Africa 6-141 still trailing Australia by more than 250 runs and attempting to avoid the follow-on.In the final session middle order players Morne Morkel and Jean-Paul Duminy steadying the innings with partnership of 43 before Morkel was bowled by Johnson in his first ball of a new spell. Paul Harris joined Duminy and remained unbeaten on 8 at the close of play. South Africa finished the second day of play at 7/198 with Duminy the last of the recognized batters unbeaten on 34. Australia clearly held the advantage with a lead of almost 200 and only three wickets remaining. Day three would change the shape of the game with strong, determined batting from South Africa combined with lackluster bowling from Australia. Harris was out early on day three which brought pace bowler Dale Steyn to the wicket. His 76 of 191 balls was another personal best and despite being dropped three times looked every part the batsman.Duminy had total control of the bowlers and with Lee sitting on the sideline with suspected stress fractures of his heel, the bowling attack was limited and struggling. His innings of over seven hours included 340 balls, 18 boundaries , took the score from 6-141 to all out for 459, a lead of 65 runs. The falls of Duminys wicket late on day three meant Australia was required to face a tough three overs to close the day.Australia began the fourth day with the goal of wiping out the deficit from their first innings and then set a target for South Africa to chase. Those plans quickly changed when Australia's opening combination of Hayden and Katich again failed with Hayden being caught by man of the moment Duminy on 23 from the bowling of Steyn. Katich fell two overs later and when Hussey was dismissed for only two in the 15th over Australia was in trouble and defending grimly at 3-49. First innings century maker, Ricky Ponting, and Michael Clarke steadied Australia and took the score to 145 when Clarke became Steyn's third wicket for the innings. Symonds, Haddin and Lee fell in quick succession with Australia reeling at 7-180 and only Ponting providing resistance. Ponting eventually fell for 99 having struggled through the nineties and then seemingly "choked" on an easy ball that should have brought up his century. Mitchell Johnson atoned for his first innings duck and supported Ponting well and continued his aggressive approach to finish on 43. Hauritz and Siddle offered little resistance and Australia was all out for 247 a lead of only 182 and more than a days play remaining.Graeme Smith commenced the run chase with his usual aggression making striking boundaries at will and finishing the days play at 25 after only six overs. Smith continued the same approach the following morning taking a total of ten boundaries in his score of 75 from only 95 balls. He had taken South Africa to a winning position and needing only 61 runs to win a historic test series. Neil McKenzie and Hashim Amla confidently closed the game finishing on 1-183 from only 48 overs.For Australia the pain was magnified with key players Symonds and Lee unlikely to take further part in the series due to injury and should Australia lose the last test in Sydney they would not only lose the world number one spot, they would fall to number three behind India with the Protea's taking top place. The final game will be played in Sydney on the 3rd January.South Africa have beaten England 15-6 in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final at Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France.Percy Montgomery kicked South Africa into the lead with a penalty after seven minutes. Soon afterwards Jonny Wilkinson kicked a penalty to equalise for England but Montgomery restored South Africa's lead just three minutes later. A push from England led to a drop goal opportunity for Jonny Wilkinson, but the kick was wide. Francois Steyn missed a chance to extend the lead with a penalty at long range, but South Africa went into half time leading 9-3 when Montgomery added his third penalty just before the interval.Soon after the restart Mark Cueto crossed South Africa's try line out wide, but  television replays showed that he had just gone in to touch. Jonny Wilkinson scored a penalty to reduce the deficit to three points, but Steyn and Montgomery each scored a penalty to win the match for South Africa.Both teams had met in the pool stages, where South Africa won comprehensively. However England regained their form to reach the final with victories over Australia and France. South Africa had little trouble reaching the final, with comfortable victories over Fiji and Argentina. South Africa claim their second World Cup victory since 1995, while England lose the title they won in 2003.The South African national rugby team has defeated the Welsh equivalent 43-17 in a home rugby test match at Bloemfontein.South Africa scored four tries to defeat current Six Nations champion Wales.

After a period of no scoring, Carter kicked another penalty goal in the 18th minute to reduce the gap to 11 to six. Neemia Tialata scored the All Blacks first try off a Carter kick. Carter converted, and the All Blacks moved ahead to 13 to 11. On halftime the All Blacks are given a penalty, 60m away from the South African line. An ambitious Carter went for the kick, and was successful, and the All Blacks went into the break 16 to 11.Carter got the first points of the second half with another penalty goal in the 43rd minute. Luke McAlister extended the All Blacks lead a few minutes later with a try of his own, and with Carter's conversion, the All Blacks lead 26 to 11.

The 34-year-old batsman uploaded a video message on Twitter saying it was a "tough decision" and he was "tired".De Villiers joined the national team, the Proteas, in 2004, featuring in a test match against England. Since then, the South African talisman has featured in 114 test matches for the Proteas, scoring 8765 runs. He has 22 test centuries to his name, the most recent one coming against Australia in March. South Africa went on to win the test series 3–0.De Villiers' batting average is above 50 in both test matches and One Day International (ODI) matches. De Villiers has featured in 228 ODI and 78 Twenty20 (T20) matches as well scoring 9577 and 1672 runs in ODIs and T20s respectively.In a match against the West Indies at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on January 18, 2015, De Villiers scored 149 runs from 44 balls. In that match, De Villiers scored the fastest half-century in ODIs, reaching 50 runs from seventeen balls, as well as the fastest century in ODIs, with 100 runs from 31 balls.Chris Nenzani, the President of Cricket South Africa, said, "AB is one of the all-time greats of South African cricket who has thrilled spectators around the world".De Villiers announced his retirement four days after he finished his Indian Premier League season with Royal Challengers Bangalore. In the video statement, De Villiers said, "I have no plans to play overseas, in fact, I hope I can continue to be available for the Titans in domestic cricket."Philip "Flying Phil" Rabinowitz was a sprinter from South Africa who, on July 10, 2004, entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the fastest 100-year-old in the 100 meters.He was born on February 16, 1904 in Lithuania to a Jewish family and died on February 28, 2008, aged 104.Rabinowitz finished in a time of 30.86 seconds; breaking the previous mark of 36.19 set by Erwin Jaskulski of Austria. A week before, the centenarian broke the record, but a faulty electronic timer kept the mark out of the books.For comparison, the world record for the men's 100 meters —9.74 seconds— was set by Asafa Powell of Jamaica at the age of 24.South African Vipers completed a hat-trick to  win their third consecutive Singapore Cricket Club International Rugby Sevens. Unbeaten throughout the two day tournament the South African team beat Fijian team Davetalevu by a margin of 24 points without allowing the Fijian team to score throughout the 20 minute final. In a replay of last years final, where the Vipers won 10-5, the mostly expatriate crowd rallied behind the Fijian team in an effort to create an upset against the Vipers who are the domestic development team of South African Sevens. It was tough and tight start with both teams putting heavy tackles and showing strong defence until the sixth minute when the SA Vipers finally managed a fast run down the left wing to score a converted try. From that point is looked ominous for Davetalevu as the Vipers began to find openings in nearly every move and only passionate defence keeping the Vipers at bay from further scoring, finishing the first half 5-0.Only two minutes into the second half the Vipers breached Davetalevu's defence and scored a relatively easy try yet failing to convert. A few minutes later Vipers crossed again and then scored a further try down the favoured left wing to bring the margin to 24-0 which would be the final score. The talent and form of the South Africans clearly showed as they have been touring for the past months.In the minor finals the Casuarina Cougars easily won the Bowl competition with a 17-0 defeat of Australian team East Arnhem Rugby. The Plate final saw a strong performance from Borneo Eagles to beat New Zealand team Oriental Rongotai by 31 to 5. Leading 12-5 at half-time the Eagles never seemed troubled during the final.The weekend was an emotional event for the Brunei Flying Kukris who recently returned from a tour of Afghanistan where they tragically lost two of their regiment. Serving out of Borneo the squad gathered before the commencement of their quarter-final to pay respect both to their own squadron but also in tribute to Remembrance Day which coincided with the weekend tournament. A minute of silence in respect to fallen soldiers was observed. Despite mixed results for the tournament the Kukris managed to qualify for the Jug Final. Kukris scored a try after full-time yet failing to convert a relatively simple kick that would have won the game for them. Final score was 21-20 with Singapore Barbarians taking the honours.Featuring teams from thirteen nations from as far as Kenya, South Africa and Scotland the tournament has grown from success to success over the past years and now features on the calendar of major sporting events in Singapore.  The tournament began in 1947 and an invitational event for Singapore and Malaysian teams and since grown into national and club teams from around the world are invited. It is hoped that the SCC 7s will soon feature on the International Rugby Boards 7s circuit according to club officials. The competition also included the return of the SCC Schools and Colleges tournament as well as the qualifying round for the International Rugby Board's Womens Rugby World Cup.On Thursday, South Korea's​ Football Association  sacked Uli Stielike as the head coach.

Stielike led the Korean team to the final of the Asian Cup in 2015 without conceding a goal, but lost to Australia in the extra time of the final.In the group A of Asian countries for the next year's World Cup qualification, South Korea is second in the table after already-qualified Iran, who has 20 points — seven more than Korea. Korea is to face Iran on August 31, and Uzbekistan on September 5.Tuesday's defeat against Qatar was Korea's third defeat in their last five games.

A second-place finish would earn the Korean team automatic qualification, but faces potential competition with third place Uzbekistan, who is trailing by only one point.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) selected Pyeongchang, South Korea as host of the 2018 Winter Games today. The committee meeting in Durban, South Africa, made its selection in the first round of voting. The South Korean city won over Munich, Germany and Annecy, France after failing in two previous tries.It was an emphatic success for South Korea after its unsuccessful applications for the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics.  This time its hour-long presentation to the committee focused on the sports with the theme "New Horizons" rather than geopolitical location and included South Korean president Lee Myung-bak and Kim Yu-na, the winner of the  2010 Olympic figure skating gold medal winner. On the first round of secret ballots, cast by the IOC's 95 voting members from 76 countries,  Pyeongchang received 63 votes to Munich's 25  and 7 for Annecy.IOC President Jacques Rogge opened the sealed envelope and made the announcement in front of the entire IOC membership and the representatives from the three candidate cities. A loud cheer erupted from the  Pyeongchang detachment, as they jumped up, hugged each other, and  waved South Korean flags.The host for the Winter Olympics was awarded on the first ballot in 1995 to Salt Lake City, Utah for the 2002 winter games, the last time the host was selected on the first ballot. Only twice before have the Winter Games been awarded to a country in Asia, both times to Japan.The 2016 Summer Games have previously been awarded to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which will be the first South American city to host the games. Sochi, Russia was selected in 2007 for the 2014 Winter Games, giving Russia its first hosting of the Winter Games.Earlier today, vision impaired South Korean skier Jae Rim Yang and her guide Soungmii Park finished fifth in the women's vision impaired slalom event with a combined time of 2:24.47 for both runs at IPC Alpine World Championships in La Molina, Spain.

The slalom event was held today after being canceled early yesterday after some skiers had already skied down the mountain.Other South Korean finishes at the IPC Alpine World Championships include an eighteenth place finish by Park in the men's sitting downhill, and a twenty-fourth place finish by Park in the men's sitting Super-G.The IPC Alpine World Championships are scheduled to continue tomorrow.London, England — South Korea earned a 4–3 goalball victory against Algeria earlier today in the fifth match of the day at London's Copper Box.South Korean Sung-Wook Hong was the game's leading scorer with 4 goals. He is a B2 classified blind competitor, though classification is largely irrelevant in goalball as all classified blind players wear masks to provide even levels of sight in the game.The B2 classified Algerian Mohamed Mokrane led his team in scoring, with two points. From Chlef, he captains a side that qualified by winning the 2011 Africa Oceania Regional Championships in Sydney, Australia.  His team comes into the Games having finished sixth at last year's World Championships.In a previous match today, Iran defeated China by a score of 9–5 after having been ahead 4–2 at the half.Southampton bosses are now contemplating the sale of one of their top players, 16-year old Theo Walcott to the highest bidder. Currently, Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea have put in bids for the player, although he admits that he wants to transfer to his childhood dream-club, Arsenal.Walcott and his family are keen to take his current skills to an even higher plataeu, and feel that only this kind of skill could be achieved with Arsenal, despite the fact that other clubs have offered to outbid Arsenal. He is likely to make the move to Arsenal's squad when his current contract runs out on his 17th Birthday. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is as happy about the move as Walcott himself is. Despite the fact Southampton has released no details of the proceedings, Wenger let slip that the deal was almost done, after revealing he was buying "two and a half" players; Emmanuel Abedayor, Abo Daiby — Walcott being referred to has the "half". When interviewed on his interest in the striker, he revealed that he had been watching him and was a big admirer "He's a quality player, I rate him personally, and we're currently looking at him. ... Ideally we would want Theo to join us straight away but it would not be a deal-breaker if Southampton say they want him to finish the season there."'"Spain defeated Germany 1–0 in the semifinals to advance Spain to its first World Cup Finals in its history. Played in Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, South Africa, the game was a re-do of the 2008 European Championship final, in which Spain also won 1–0. About 60,960 people, including Spain's Queen Sofía, were in attendance.The game got off to an interesting start after an Italian fan invaded the pitch in the fourth minute, briefly interrupting the game. A first half dominated both by the German defense and the increasingly powerful offense kept both teams scoreless at halftime. Spain used the second half to threaten the German goal. In the 57th minute, Spain's David Villa came within inches of scoring on an Andrés Iniesta cross, and Sergio Ramos was equally close to convert Xabi Alonso's pass. Carles Puyol scored the lone goal in the 73rd minute by heading in Xavi's corner kick. As the game came to an end, the German team was visibly distraught, while fans of the Spanish team partied until late at night, waving flags and singing "Ole! Ole! Ole!".Villa later said, "This is one of the greatest moments for Spain, for us to be in the final of the World Cup, it's history. And we want to make more history in the final."In addition to being Spain's first finals appearance, the Netherlands' defeat of Uruguay on Tuesday advanced the Netherlands to the finals as well. As neither team has won the World Cup before, this match-up ensures that either the Netherlands or Spain will come out having won the World Cup for the first time. It will also be the two teams' first ever match against each other in the World Cup. Uruguay and Germany will play each other for third place on Saturday at 18:30 UTC, while the finals will be on Sunday 18:30 UTC.Spain has won the final of the 2009 European Basketball Championships (also known as EuroBasket) in Poland by beating Greece in the semi-final on Saturday by 82-64, and then going on to beat Serbia in the final on Sunday night by 85-63.It’s the first time that Spain has won the Gold medal despite being in the final on six previous occasions, and trainer Sergio Scariolo has thus ended an long-running jinx.The game was dominated by the Spanish play, with Pau Gasol, Rudy Fernández, and Felipe Reyes leading the Spanish combination, whose defence proved key to winning the match.Gasol was voted the tournament's most valuable player, but praised the other members of his team."Obviously I'm extremely happy at the outcome of the game - we've played amazingly well for the last five games and a half," Gasol told the BBC. "I'm super-proud of my team-mates and coaching staff who got us where we are today."Spain defeated the Netherlands in extra time 1–0 to win this year's FIFA World Cup. The winning goal came in the last few minutes of the match, which saw thirteen yellow cards and one red card.Yesterday's win marked Spain's first World Cup victory, in their first World Cup final appearance, making the Spanish team the eighth distinct team to have won the championship since it began in 1930. It was the second time that the European champion for that year won the World Cup as well, the first being West Germany's victory in 1974. It was also the first time that a European team emerged as the World Cup victors on a continent other than Europe. For the Dutch, it was the third time they have lost in the World Cup finals, having done so in 1974 and 1978.The final match, played in Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium, stayed tied at 0–0 for all of regulation time. Called "a very difficult match" by Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque, the game started with a slow first half. The Dutch had an opportunity to take the lead in the second half, but Arjen Robben's shots were blocked by Spanish captain Iker Casillas. The Netherlands were forced to play with only ten players near the end of extra time after John Heitinga was kicked out of the game.The winning shot of the match came from Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta in the 116th minute, just four minutes from the end of extra time. He managed to kick the ball past Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from just 8 metres (26.2 feet) away. If Iniesta had not made the goal, and game stayed scoreless until the end of extra time, the game would have been decided by a penalty shoot-out.Spain's victory was correctly predicted by the oracular animal Paul the Octopus. Paul's 2010 FIFA World Cup prediction record stayed at 100 per cent as a result.With the first day of racing completed earlier today in La Molina for the 2013 IPC World Championships, the Spanish team started the competition with a first and fifth place finish in the downhill event in the men's visually impaired group.

To manage the national team, Lopetegui should not have a contract with any football club. Speaking at a press conference at Krasnodar, RFEF's head Luis Rubiales said, "I found out five minutes before Real Madrid made the announcement [about Lopetegui]. I asked that nothing was to be done until the team arrives at Krasnodar. But this is not possible" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Me enteré cinco minutos antes que el Real Madrid lo anunciara. Pedí que no se hiciera nada hasta llegar a Krasnodar. Pero no fue posible.Rubiales said, "I do not feel betrayed. While he has been with us, Lopetegui has done an impeccable job." ((es))Spanish language: ‍No me siento traicionado. Lopetegui, mientras ha estado con nosotros, ha hecho un trabajo impecable. Sporting director Fernando Hierro was named as the national team's new head coach.Julen Lopetegui was announced La Roja's manager on July 21, 2016. Lopetegui has been in-charge of the national team for 20 matches, winning fourteen and drawing the remaining six. Lopetegui was the manager of Spain's U-19 team from 2010 till 2012. Later, he handled sub-20 before moving to the U-21 team. He has also coached Portuguese club Porto FC.In the press conference, Rubiales said, "Winning is very important, but there are more important things, like the way of work. So despite Lopetegui being a 'top' coach, we have been forced to make this decision" ((es))Spanish language: ‍Ganar es muy importante, pero hay cosas más importantes aún, como las formas de trabajar. Por ello, pese a que Lopetegui es un entrenador 'top', nos hemos visto obligados a tomar esta decisión.Spain is scheduled to play their first group stage match against Portugal on Friday in Sochi.

The schedule, which the British newspaper The Guardian defines as “sports dominated,” covered sport for eleven and a half hours of Saturday afternoon.The statement added that “we [the BBC] realise that not everyone enjoys watching sport but there is undeniably a large section of our audience who do.” The statement also said that  the BBC should provide content which will be enjoyed by the “large section” of society who enjoy watching sport.The BBC’s sports coverage included eight hours of coverage of the Six Nations rugby tournament, which the BBC has secured the Six Nations coverage up to 2013, in a deal which cost the BBC 160 million GBP.Australia's Allan Davis won the 2009 Tour Down Under professional road cycling race.Sprint specialist Davis completed Sunday's final stage in the main pack to maintain the lead he had built up in time bonuses from sprint wins earlier in the race.122 cyclists completed the six day race around a circuit starting and ending at Adelaide, South Australia.American cyclist Lance Armstrong also participated in the race, his first professional bike race since the 2005 Tour de France.

The other nominated sports are baseball, golf, karate, roller sports, rugby and softball. Of these, four were nominated for the London 2012 Olympics, but none were chosen. At the International Olympic Committee (IOC) session in Singapore 2005, squash won the vote to get into the Olympic program, but did not get the 2/3 majority needed for adoption. The new sports for 2016 are baseball and softball, with baseball having been in the Olympics before as a "test" sport, however it did not succeed and was only on the program for one event before it was removed.Squash is among the favourites because it already in 2005 proved to be favourite for the IOC members at that time. Since 2005, according to the World Squash Federation (WSF), there has been a lot of work to get squash into the Olympic Games. A marked rise in players across the world has occurred, and approximately 13 new countries have been adopted into the WSF.However, baseball is also considered among the favourites, because it has been tried before and because it is a major sport in the United States and growing in the rest of the world. Notably, Chicago is bidding to host the 2016 Olympics, and therefore a major US sport could be the natural choice. The last of the three favourites is golf, because it is by far the most played sport of the candidates. However, it is seen as a disadvantage that the Olympic tournament may not be the top priority for the players, who may feel they would rather concentrate on the US or European tours.Norton Fredrick, the Sri Lankan cricketer who played for the national All Ceylon team during the 1960s, has died at the age of 73. He died in his home town of Wattala after suffering from a terminal illness. He played for the Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club as well as nationally for the All Ceylon team, before Sri Lanka had test status.During his national career he played against nations such as Pakistan, Australia, and India. A skilled fast bowler he spoke about his first match saying “It was a very memorable baptism for me. The match was played at the Colombo Oval – Sara Stadium. I bowled well and took a hat-trick. I still remember the three victims – R. Ramesh, V. V. Kumara and G. Thomas. I played two Gopalan games in 1964 and 1965. It was a wonderful experience. We played for the love of the game.” During an unofficial test match against India in 1965 he set up a four-wicket win after taking seven wickets. This was the first time that the All Ceylon team had won against India. His national career was ended in 1968 after family commitments forced him to end his career. Fredrick is survived by his wife and a son. Another son served as an army officer and died during the Sri Lankan civil war. Fredrick's death comes in the same month as Gamini Goonasena, another former Sri Lankan cricketer who died at the age of 80.St Louis Cardinals defeated Texas Rangers over seven games to win baseball's World Series for an eleventh time yesterday.The Cardinals won the last game 6–2, with the highlights of the game being a solo home-run for batter Allen Craig and defensive pitching by Chris Carpenter.A record 47,399 supporters filled Busch Stadium in St Louis to watch the game, with thousands more outside the ground.The Cardinals were trailing 3–2 going into the sixth game, but won a narrow victory with World Series Most Valuable Player David Freese guiding his team to victory.

Veteran fighter Carlo "Neo" Prater also prevailed in his Strikeforce debut against Bryan Travers. Ryan Couture, son of MMA legend Randy Couture, remained undefeated in his second-ever bout.Lyle Beerbohm came into the main event bout with an undefeated 15-0-0 record, in addition to his 8-0-0 amateur record. "This is going to be a fun, tough, hard fight that I expect will go everywhere," stated Beerbohm in a pre-fight media workout on Wednesday. "There’ll be stand-up, wrestling, a little bit of everything. My time has come and I am really looking forward to the fight." Beerbohm also stated he wanted to eventually fight for a Strikeforce Lightweight title, but recognized that he first needed to move past his veteran opponent, Pat Healey, who came into the fight with a record of 25-17-0, who was making his return to action since his loss to Josh Thompson via submission in 2010.The bout was very close, going the distance through all three rounds. While Beerbohm pushed a lot of the action, especially with grappling on the ground, Healey was able to land more effective strikes and weathered persistent take-down attempts from Beerbohm. The action was back-and-forth, neither fighter never able to clearly dominate the other. The last few minutes of the fight proved to be the best for Healey, who wore down Beerbohm's strength and left him gasping for air, allowing Healey to attempt more submissions on the ground. The three judges scored the bout 29-28, 29-28, and 29-28 to give Healey the unanimous decision win.After the match, Beerbohm was upbeat, but felt he had won the bout. "I definitely thought I won. I thought going into the third we'd each won a round, but I definitely thought I won that last round. I took the fight to him from the start. But that's what happens when you let it go to the hands of the judges." Healey complimented his opponent, "Beerbohm fought a good fight but I think I outworked and outhustled him." Healey also welcomed the idea of a rematch, stating, "He talked a lot of trash, but if he wants a rematch, I’ll give him one anytime." Asked who he wanted to face next, Healey stated he wanted to fight the winner of the Billy "Cyborg" Evangelista and Jorge "Gamebred" Masvidal on March 5, noting that both fighters had previously defeated his brother, Pat Healey.The co-main event for the show featured Carlo "Neo" Prater, a veteran fighter with a 25-10-1 record making his Strikeforce debut against the 14-3-0 Bryan Travers. The bout was over in just 38 seconds as Prater used his superior reach to jab Travers several times before using a trip to take Travers to the ground and submitting him with an Anaconda Choke. Prater showed a lot of emotion in his post-fight interview. "My record shows I’m not a perfect fighter, but when you’re down you get up," Prater said. "This was a good win, I’ll get better off this fight, but I’ll be right back in the gym soon."Ryan Couture, the son of MMA legend Randy "the Nature" Couture, pushed his fight record to 2-0-0 with a victory over 2-0-0 opponent Lee Higgins. Most of the first round featured very little action until Higgins attempted to take down Couture, and found himself fighting off Guillotine Choke and a D'Arce Choke in the last minute of the round. Couture dominated nearly all of the second round with superior stand-up striking and ground control. Higgins fared little better in the third, as Couture was able to put Higgins against the cage and stop Higgins' take-down attempts, and then eventually control Higgins on the ground before submitting him with a Rear Naked Choke with 20 seconds left in the bout.To round out the broadcast, Ryan Lawson (5-2-0) defeated Erik Apple (10-2-0) at 3:14 of Round 2 by Triangle Choke, and David "Tarzan" Douglas (6-2-0) defeated Nick Gonzalez (16-8-0, 1 NC) at 1:05 of Round 1 by a Rear Naked Choke submission.

In a final bout, the 153kg Asashōryū beat Hakuhō Shō who had earlier defeated him in the regulation rounds. It was a well-matched playoff with both men entering the final round with a 14-1 record. After the win Asashōryū exclaimed "I'm Back". Asashōryū had missed almost nine months of competition due to an elbow injury.Asashōryū whose real name is Dolgorsuren Dagvadorj and hailing from Ulan Bator, Mongolia, started the tournament fourteen days earlier with an opening-day win over komusubi Kisenosato. His tournament win creates a new record with yokozuna becoming only the fourth man to win 23 Emperors Cups. He now is only one win behind Kitanoumi (24), but a long way from both Chiyonofuji (31) and Taiho (32).Speaking about the earlier round loss to Hakuhō, Asashōryū said "the loss helped motivate me. I knew everything was on the line". He put the earlier loss down to a hesitant Tachi-ai - the initial charge at each other. Expectations of a fourth consecutive win were high after beating Asashōryū in the earlier bout. Prior to the final bout Asashōryū practiced his tachai and modified his belt grip to ensure he didn't fall into the same problems he faced in the earlier bout with Hakuhō. The change of strategy worked in the final round, with Asashōryū taking an early advantage with a strong left grip on Hakuho's belt. This neutralized the left hand on Hakuhō, which has been dominant throughout the tournament. Soon after Asashōryū secured a right-hand grip on Hakuhō's front belt and pushed him over the bales, with seemingly little effort to the cheer of the packed stadium. The return of Asashōryū has been a huge boost to Sumo with the association reveling in sellout crowds.Asashōryū's stablemaster, Takasago was pleased that Asashōryū returned to fighting and also pleased with the win in the tournament, but now questions whether he has the passion to continue. He said "Now's he won, he needs to take a good look at himself and make sure he has the desire to do it all again."Sunderland A.F.C have announced Steve Bruce as their new manager, signing a three-year contract, taking over from Ricky Sbragia who left the club at the end of last season.Steve Bruce has previously managed clubs such as Sheffield United F.C., Birmingham City F.C., Crystal Palace F.C., Huddersfield Town F.C. and twice at Wigan Athletic F.C..Sunderland's chairman, Niall Quinn was delighted at the appointment and said, "Steve knows more than anyone what football means to people of this region, and I'm confident that he will be able to instill into our players exactly what it means to play for this football club."Dave Whelan, chairman of Wigan, said everyone at the club would be "devastated" at the loss, however went on to thank Bruce for his work at the club by saying, "What Steve has achieved here over the past 18 months has been magnificent. After a period of instability he put the team in order and started laying the foundations for a prosperous future."Sunderland slumped to their 14th league game without a victory despite a spirited performance against league leaders Chelsea F.C.. Records were set before this Sunday afternoon game kicked-off in the North-East; bookmaker's were offering the shortest odds for an away win in the history of the Premier League, as top faced bottom at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland, in the middle of a season breaking records for the wrong reasons, were hoping to avoid a result as bad as the 7-0 defeat local rivals Middlesbrough suffered to Arsenal the day before.Despite pre-match predictions, the Londoners looked out of sorts for much of the first-half, and it was the home side who took a shock-lead on 11 minutes. Jon Terry failed to completely clear a Julio Arca punt into the box, and Liam Lawrence pounced with a low, powerful volley in to the bottom corner.Chelsea were not behind for long; Sunderland defenders were caught-out on 20 minutes, when a William Gallas cross, which looked as though it was headed out of play, was headed back across the face of goal by Joe Cole. Defenders were caught flat-footed, and Argentinian Hernan Crespo was first to react with a close-range header.In the second half Chelsea began to exert authority; they dominated possession and chances and looked most likely to take the lead. Sunderland keeper Kelvin Davis, suffering criticism from Sunderland fans as of late, made a series of superb stops to deny Chelsea the lead. It was a cruel deflection off the head of Dean Whitehead which finally gave the reigning champions the lead on 70 minutes, Dutchman Arjen Robben providing the strike. The game's main talking point occurred moments later, as Robben jumped over advertising boards in order to celebrate the goal with the traveling fans. As stewards scrambled to remove Robben from the clutches of the jubilant Chelsea followers, referee Chris Foy, working to the letter of the law, brandished a second yellow card and sent the midfield playmaker off.10-man Chelsea held on despite a period of late Sunderland pressure. The defeat sees Sunderland remain rooted to the foot of the table on 6 points.Reigning Sunshine Coast Schoolboys Premier 1st XV champions have squeezed past Nambour Christian College seven points to five at the Nambour Rugby Club on Wednesday.

The games are considered a matter of national prestige and generate more media attention than the recent changes in Russian government (Russia’s Putin recently installed the new prime-minister, who, incidentally, also became the chair of the Russian Olympic committee.) As Russia takes enormous efforts to prepare for the Olympics and build a modern sport infrastructure from scratch, the Russian public is more concerned with the mascot for the upcoming games. When Moscow hosted the Summer Olympics in the 1980, the mascot for the Moscow Games was Misha the Bear, developed by children’s book illustrator Victor Chizhikov. Misha instantly became a graphic-design hit, especially in the Soviet bloc. Olympic posters were snatched up and t-shirts were fought over. And as Sochi is set to become the new Olympic city, Russians are keen to see the old bear return. There is a long way to the Sochi Olympics, but the Bear is already coming back from retirement. Russia! magazine, an English-language publication distributed in the US and the UK, has commissioned the most prominent designers and artists to do their own renditions of the famed mascot. “The Olympic Bear turns any Russian between the ages of 25 and 50 to quivering jelly. Our artistic compatriots were happy to whip the old bear into shape for 21st century use” – says Ilya Merenzon, the magazine’s publisher. “And the readers’ response was overwhelming. As soon as the new issue arrived at the stores, we constantly get emails requesting the Bear t-shirts. The animal is regaining his popularity”. – adds Merenzon. It has not been decided, however, on the Sochi Games mascot. Another option is Cheburashka, a famous Russian cartoon character with big ears and humble smile. Cheburashka was the mascot for the Russian Olympic team in Turin and is one of the best-selling children’s toys in former USSR countries and, surprisingly, Japan, where it is known as “Chebu”.The Surf Championship Competition, "Ceremonial Quiksilver Pichilemu 2010", took place on Wednesday in the Chilean city nicknamed "Capital of the Surf", Pichilemu.

Everest in 40 hours without using supplementary oxygen, a feat that astonished other mountain climbers.Saying that he was essentially a solitary person, he told a Trento film festival in a video posted on its web site last year, "First of all I’d like to thank the mountains, for almost 40 years they have allowed me to climb, and with this passion I’ve lived an extraordinary life up to now, that’s why I’d like to thank them."He added, "I now want to share this passion more with others, and it’s because of this that being a mountain guide is a good profession because you can help someone who dreams about climbing mountains. This is something very beautiful." In 2001 his personal life was marred by a manslaughter charge  for shaking to death his seven-month old son to stop him from crying. He plead guilty in 2003 and received a four-month suspended sentence.  The case ignited a debate in Switzerland over shaking babies.Switzerland has lifted a 52 year old ban on any form of motor racing taking part in the country. The ban was first introduced following the more than 80 deaths in the disaster at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans.The ban was lifted following heated discussions within the Swiss parliament with some arguing that the reintroduction of the sport could help the countries component manufacturers and the tourism industry, while others argued that the sport wasn't good for the environment.The final voting saw the ban lifted with 97 votes for and 77 against.Australian A-League club Sydney FC has sacked manager Branko Čulina, nine rounds into the 2007-08 season.Čulina was appointed following Terry Butcher's sacking at the end of the 2006-07 season, after Sydney played unattractive football and only managed to finish fourth in the eight-team competition.Čulina began his managament career at the St Albans Saints in 1989, following a successful career as a player which concluded at the same club. He has since managed seven other major teams, including the very successful Sydney United, before his appointment to Sydney FC.According to reports, he was summoned to Sydney FC headquarters on the afternoon of October 22 (AEST), before being told his services were no longer required. Čulina, having been appointed prior to Sydney's first incursion into Asian club football as part of the 2007 AFC Champions League, only served six months of his two year contract.His former team sit in sixth place, having won just two of a total of nine A-League games this season. They currently sit four points from the top four, which grants entry into the final series, after nine of twenty-one rounds.Australian A-League club Sydney FC has been docked three competition points by Football Federation Australia (FFA) after it was found guilty of breaching the Player Contracting Regulations.The FFA stated that the offences warranted a A$259,000 fine as well as a three-point deduction, however it considered "the cooperation and full disclosure provided by the current Sydney FC Board and Management to the FFA" during the investigation process, and reduced the penalty to a A$129,000 fine plus two competition points deducted.However, this most recent breach also activated a one-point suspended penalty issued to Sydney FC in August 2006 for previous breaches of the salary cap, increasing the total points lost during this case to three.This latest breach also incurred a suspended penalty of a one-point deduction which will automatically be activated for any breaches during seasons 2006-07 or 2007-08.In a statement released on the official A-League website, "the [FFA] Board determined that the following breaches had occurred: an undisclosed payment made to a player; pre-payments from the Club to players; and payments made by the Club to agents of the players".Sydney FC, the defending champions of the A-League, will not be deducted the competition points immediately and has one week to appeal. If Sydney decides not to appeal the FFA decision, the points will be removed on January 5, 2007.According to Sportal, the club has notified the FFA it intends to appeal the decision, however no formal confirmation has been published. Sydney FC have said in a statement on their website that "the club will consider its options regarding the decision before issuing a further statement".Sydney is currently sitting in second position on the 2006-07 A-League table and the three-point reduction would see it fall to third place.After 72 long years, long suffering fans of the Sydney Swans football club will be toasting their club's success as they defeated the West Coast Eagles of Perth today in the AFL Grand Final by a score of 8.10 (58) to 7.12 (54), a victory of four points. This gives the Swans, formerly based in South Melbourne before moving to Sydney in 1982, their first premiership since 1933.Sydney captain Barry Hall and West Coast goalsneak Adam Hunter both kicked two goals in a low-scoring affair. West Coast kicked the first goal, and then proceeded to kick another after Sydney replied. The Swans went on to kick five unanswered goals (6 points) to take a 20-point lead into halftime, while the Eagles could manage a handful of behinds (1 point). The Eagles came alive in the third quarter, and at three-quarter time reduced the deficit to two points thanks to picked-up performances from West Coast stars like David Wirrapunda and Brownlow Medal winner Ben Cousins. However, attempts at goal were wasted as West Coast failed to capitalize throughout the game at many scoring opportunities. West Coast gained the lead 15 minutes in the final quarter thanks largely in part to a misjudged short kick by Luke Ablett which was caught by Cousins right in the front of the goal. This would bring the Eagle lead up to 10, before Amon Buchanan's goal erased the deficit. The Eagles mounted a spirited charge in the dying minutes, but a timely saving mark by Leo Barry seconds before the final siren was the final nail in West Coast's coffin. Chris Judd won the Norm Smith Medal for being voted the best-on-ground, becoming the fourth person to win this honour while representing the losing side. The grand final was Sydney and West Coast's fourth meeting of the season, with both teams splitting the home-and-away series. The Eagles had defeated the Swans by the same Grand Final-winning margin in the Qualifying final at Subiaco Oval three weeks ago, and it is a vindication for the Swans, who lost that match on a number of questionable umpiring decisions which the AFL's chief umpire Jeff Gieschen later admitted were incorrect.The Swans had also come under great criticism earlier in the year from footy commentators and AFL Commissioner Andrew Demetriou for their now premiership-winning tactics, which was criticized as "boring" and, in the words of Demetriou, would lead the Swans to "lose more games than they would win" this season, but the Swans achievement forced  Demetriou to backtrack his words days before the Grand Final.91,898 footy fans of all stripes and locales packed the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the game, which was opened with entertainment from the likes of Delta Goodrem (singing I Am Australian), the finalists of Australian Idol (performing Waltzing Matilda), Dame Edna and Michael Buble.John Steven's (Sydney Swans fan) later remarked "This was one of the most exciting, gripping and enthralling matches I have ever witnessed." This game will certainly leave a mark in the record books.Sydney, New South Wales —Earlier today, in the city's central business district, the Australian Olympic Team were welcomed home in the first of a series of parades to be held in each Australian state capital.Thousands of Australians lined George Street, the city's original high street, and in front of Town Hall. At the ceremony welcoming the atheletes home, Lauren Jackson received the key to the city, silver medallist Jessica Fox received a plaque from the Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, and Libby Trickett reaffirmed her passion and desire to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games.Australia's London Olympians signed and displayed an Olympic flag to be given to the Australian Paralympians for the upcoming 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.The Suns had been on fire for the entire month of January. Unfortunately for them, Kevin Garnett was holding the extinguisher when the Suns came into the Target Center on Monday night.Garnett posted a double-double, scoring 44 points and snaring 11 rebounds, as the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Phoenix Suns 121-112. The loss prevented the Suns from posting a perfect record in the month of January, and ended the Suns' season-high 17-game winning streak.The Suns had problems answering Garnett's scoring prowess, but it was the Minnesota defense that doomed the Suns, limiting them to 17 points in the final quarter after allowing 95 from Phoenix in the first three periods. Steve Nash had 20 points and 18 assists, but in the fourth quarter he was only able to score 3 points and provide one assist.In the fourth quarter, it was simply the Kevin Garnett show.Garnett scored 15 points in the fourth quarter, with 13 of those points coming in the final 6:20 of the period. "It's just about being a presence," Garnett said. "It's about making them have to deal with me. I will continue to take that approach." In addition to his 44-point night, Garnett helped his team by not turning the ball over at all during the game.Such a performance was not the case for Steve Nash, who turned the ball over an uncharacteristic five times during the game. The Suns had 14 turnovers as a team. It was a case of Garnett and the Timberwolves taking full advantage of the mistakes the Suns made and turning it into an opportunity to win.However, the loss certainly didn't leave the Suns or their coach, Mike D'Antoni, discouraged."We'll start another [streak]. This is fun."Tatenda Taibu, the captain of the Zimbabwe cricket team, has announced that he will stand down from international cricket, after further threats were made against him by controversial Zimbabwean cricket figure Themba Mliswa.Taibu alleges that he was threatened by Mliswa at a meeting with Zimbabwe Cricket Board chairman Peter Chingoka at a meeting earlier this week.  He claims that Mliswa said to him "If you thought it is over it is not. Your time is coming and I will get you".  Taibu had earlier gone into hiding when he received a telephone call, allegedly from Mliswa, in which threats were made against him and his wife and child.  He says he is now considering his options, and a move to playing provincial cricket in South Africa, or county cricket in England appears likely.  The largely state-controlled Zimbabwean media has largely attempted to portray the defection as a money issue, or a racial issue, and has not aired Taibu's allegations publicly.Zimbabwe cricket has lurched from crisis to crisis recently, as political appointees from the Mugabe regime infiltrate the sport's governing structure.  Many of the country's top players have either fled the country or turned their backs on the game, including Henry Olonga who fled into exile after having an arrest warrant issued in his name for treason, after stating that democracy was dead in Zimbabwe at the 2003 Cricket World Cup.To help cancer patients overcoming cancer and finding a bright life, Taiwan Cancer Friends New Life Association invited more than 100 cancer patients and volunteers and held the pre-tour launch of "Passing Through Cancer, Finding Love" Eastern Taiwan Bicycle Tour Challenge from Fugang (Taidong) to ChiShinTam (Seven Star Basin, Hualien) for a new miracle.Min-fa Lin (Secretary General of Taiwan Cancer Friends New Life Association) remarked that a cancer patient inspires this tour because the one finished a small bicycle tour from Shihlin to Tamshui, after this event known by governments and companies, Sports Affairs Council of Executive Yuan of Taiwan (SAC) supervised and Giant Co., Ltd. sponsored this Hualien-Taidong tour. He also hoped this event will inspire common people finding a bright life from a dark or hopeless life.Huang-lang Tsai (Deputy Commissioner of SAC) remarked that SAC promoted public sports in Taiwan for a long period, and SAC respected the participation on disadvantaged people or minority. He hoped those disadvantaged people such as handicapped, cancer patients, deaf people can participate sports equally with common people, and also recommended some low-cost sports like long-distance running, walking, and bicycle riding, and hoped people in Taiwan will support "Taiwan Citizen Walking Day" at November 11, 2007.After the speech by Tsai, he presented a symbolized flag to a delegate named Tsia-tse Kuo and hoped this trip will succeed.This challenging tour will take place at September 23 and 24.London, England — Come rain or fair weather, the 2012 Summer Paralympics were off to a brilliant start with the official opening ceremonies."Prepare to be inspired, prepare to be dazzled, prepare to be moved." former British Olympian and politician Sebastien Coe told the spectating crowd of 80,000 at Olympic Park.A leading Queensland union says that the Melbourne Cup due to be run tomorrow at 3:00pm Australian Eastern Daylight Saving Time could be used as a valuable educational tool in the classroom.The Queensland Teachers Union president Steve Ryan said that he supported staff making their own decisions on whether to watch the race but statistics principles could be taught in conjunction with showing the race.Mr Ryan said that incorporating the Cup into the curriculum would make statistics 'real' to work with, rather than using textbook material. "It's about making subjects real and certainly that's a good example of how you can use a particular situation."Many religious schools in Brisbane have chosen not to show the race due to gambling concerns.Team New Zealand has beaten Luna Rossa Challenge 5-0, thus having the right to challenge current America Cup holder, Alinghi.Team New Zealand racing in NZL-92, beat Italian team, Luna Rossa five times in a row and won the Louis Vuitton Cup.NZL-92 completed the race 22 seconds ahead of ITA-94, the Italian's yacht.In the 24-year history, Team New Zealand has become the first team to defeat another team five times in a row, without losing once. Dean Barker, helsman, said that they are very proud of what they have achieved.Both teams had not been changed for the yacht race, though Luna Rossa did make an approved change to ITA-94.On June 23 the best-of-nine challenge for America's Cup will start. The fourth time straight New Zealand will be competing.Team New Zealand won the fourth race on Tuesday against Luna Rossa Challenge in the bid to win the Louis Vuitton Cup.Team NZ, racing with the boat NZL-92, won the race 52 seconds ahead of Luna Rossa, racing with boat ITA94.Team NZ have won all the races so far at Valencia, so if they can win another race against the Italian team, Team NZ will be able to challenge Alinghi for America's Cup. Luna Rossa will need to win the next five races to challenge for the Cup.Torben Grael, strategist for Luna Rossa, said that ITA94 does not handle very well in the light winds. Both Grael and mainsail trimmer Jonathan McKee, congratulates Team New Zealand for sailing well. McKee said it was no surprise that they were sailing well.Ray Davies, strategist for Team New Zealand, also described the conditions as "fickle", and says that anything can happen.The wind was estimated to be at around 6-10 knots. The other previous races have all been under 14 knots, lower for the most recent races.At mark one, NZL92 was leading by 19 seconds, despite ITA94 having a lead of four boat lengths at the start of the match. Grael said, "We thought the right side was good and we tacked on what we thought was a safe position."Traveller and wind spotter, Adam Beashel says that NZL92 is not faster than ITA94, but they are, at least, even. "We're happy with an even boat race with anybody at the moment." But does say that if they can match an opponents speed, they will be hard to beat.The only changes that Team New Zealand have made to NZL92 was a few new sails, but state that's about it. It has been reported that Luna Rossa will be technically altering their boat.Going into the third scheduled day of competition at the IPC Alpine World Championships in La Molina, Spain yesterday, the United States para-alpine team has delivered with a gold medal won by Laurie Stephens in the women's sitting downhill,  a silver medal won by men's sit skier Stephen Lawler in the downhill, and bronze medal won by Laurie Stephens in the women's sitting Super-G.

LW12-2 women's sit-skier Victor also did not start in the downhill event.Visually-impaired B3 classified skier Bathum chatted with his guide, Sean Ramsden, immediately following both his races.  While he was unhappy with his downhill run, Bathum was happy with and had fun during his seventh place run in the Super-G event where he finished with a factored time of 1:13.51, only 3.02 seconds slower than the winning time set by Spanish skier Jon Santacana.United States skiers were scheduled to compete yesterday in the Slalom discipline but the competition was cancelled due to high winds. Several members of Team USA had a pizza party after the slalom cancellation. Friday's scheduled event  had been rescheduled as a result of predicted snow and high winds during the day.  No snow arrived until late in the afternoon, where there was limited accumulation.  Some of the younger members of Team USA took advantage of the night off on Thursday to go bowling before a busy training day Friday.In other United States Paralympic news, Sir Philip Craven, the President of the International Paralympic Committee, told a Wikinews reporter the country will have live television coverage of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. When a member of  Team USA competing in La Molina was asked if they heard confirmation of this, they were unable to confirm.  They did highlight the lack of United States media coverage was frustrating for fans wanting to follow the Games in London.  According to the skier, many people he knew could only follow the Games by searching for video on sites like YouTube.Ten climbers at a ski resort in Zigana, Turkey have died in an avalanche. They were part of a group of seventeen from the nearby province of Trabzon. The avalanche occurred at 11:15 local time (9:15 UTC) yesterday on Mount Zigana in the Gumushane region of Turkey near the Black Sea coast. Winter sports are increasing in popularity across Turkey, as it is mountainous.The climbers were at a height of 7,260ft (2,200m) while crossing a deep valley, when the snow hit them. As search teams and locals arrived, they managed to pull seven climbers free from the snow; at least two were taken to hospital, one of which died in hospital. They were walking in a single-file line, as it hit them. One of the survivors made a hole with their arms, so they could breathe. The block of snow dragged them 1,000 metres into a valley as the avalanche traveled down the mountain.The avalanche may have caused by rising temperatures in the area. A gun-shot was also considered as an outside possibility after some witnesses said they heard one. This occurred as climbers were killed in Scotland after an avalanche, as well another seven deaths across the French Alps.Three French sport stars are among the dead following a helicopter crash on Monday in Villa Castelli, Argentina. In total, ten people died after the crash, which involved two helicopters. The dead included passengers and both pilots in the mid-air collision. The victims were taking part in the French reality television show 'Dropped' when the accident happened.The victims included Olympic swimmer Camille Muffat, Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine and Florence Arthaud, a yachtswoman. Both pilots were Argentinian, the remainder of the victims were French and worked as part of the television shows production team. Bodies of all ten of the victims have been retrieved and taken to the morgue. The accident occurred while both helicopters were flying at a low altitude in tandem. Amateur camera footage shows the helicopters colliding when one appears to fly into the path of the other. It remains unclear what caused actions which lead to the crash. Cesar Angulo, Secretary of Security for La Rioja, the province in which the accident happened released an update. He said "An explosion occurred and it's believed that they must have collided. Aeronautical experts will have to determine that."French President Francois Hollande paid tribute to the victims. Speaking about the sport stars who lost their lives he said "They are dead because they wanted to push the boundaries. They wanted to make new exploits known to the world, make people aware of new countries and regions." An involuntary manslaughter investigation has been opened by French officials. The procedure occurred automatically due to the fact the French citizens died abroad.The television show involves contestants taking part in survival style activities in remote locations. Other contestants taking part included figure skater Philippe Candeloro, footballer Sylvain Wiltord, snowboarder Anne-Flore Marxer, swimmer Alain Bernard and Jeannie Longo, a cyclist. All the other contestants were uninjured during the accident. The show, which was to be shown on TF1 in France started filming in February. The channel released a statement after the accident. They said "We learn with immense sadness of the accident that occurred during the filming of the show 'Dropped.' [Staff] come together in this terrible time with the pain of the families and those close to the victims". French media announced that all contestants and crew are returning home and that filming had been suspended. Muffat became the Olympic champion in the 400m freestyle event at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England. The 25-year-old also won a silver and bronze medal at the same games in different events. Vastine, 28, also competed at the 2012 games, being eliminated from the Light Welterweight category in the quarter finals. He won a gold medal in the 2008 games in Beijing, China. Arthaud, 57, was a yachtswoman who won the 1990 Route du Rhum.At the start of the tournament, 19-year-old Rafael Nadal of Spain was seeded as the second favourite to take the Monte Carlo Masters clay court title, ranked only behind the current world number one, 25-year-old Roger Federer of Switzerland. The finals match-up in question, the first where the number 1 and 2 seeds faced each other since 1985, was won in four sets; 6-2, 6-7, 6-3, 7-6, ending in just eleven minutes short of four hours.As the lengthy matchtime suggests, the action on the court was a see-saw battle with both players looking as though they would go on to win at different points of the match. At times, it was difficult to see who was the more experienced.  Nadal, the more successful of the two on a clay tennis surface, played to Roger Federer's weakness. Roger Federer didn't give up without a fight, but his best, which is capable of beating anybody on his day, seemed to remain in the locker room as Roger Federer's aggression came a rare second to Nadal's accurate baseline style.Nadal wins the Monte Carlo Masters for a second consecutive time. Nadal can celebrate his unexpected but much welcomed victory in Monaco, if only for a little while ahead of the next tournament in the clay court series.Scottish tennis player Andy Murray has won the Montreal Masters event in Canada. Murray, who recently reached number two in the world, defeated Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro.Murray lost the first set in a tie break after both men held each and every serve in the set. Del Potro had the early advantage in the second set, but this too required a tie break after reaching 6-6. Potro received treatment to his shoulder at this point but managed to return to the game. According to The Guardian, del Potro looked tired in the third set and this was ultimately won by Murray 6–1, giving the overall victory to the Scot.  He is now set to head to the Cincinnati Open next week to defend his title from last year.Today, Scottish tennis player Andy Murray withdrew from the upcoming Australian Open Grand Slam tournament, the organisers announced via Twitter. Two days ago, Murray announced withdrawal from the Brisbane International suffering from a hip injury. A five-time finalist at the Australian Open, Murray has not played a single competitive game since he was knocked-out of last year's Wimbledon Championship by US tennis player Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals. Murray did not participate in the US Open, withdrawing from the Grand Slam two days before it was to commence. Winner of three Grand Slams, the Scot is currently ranked sixteenth in the world. He was scheduled to play Ryan Harrison in Brisbane.The 30-year-old exited in the fourth round in last year's Australian Open. Next month, Murray is to lose points earned for the fourth round. This year's tournament is scheduled to start on January 15.

The final score was 6–4, 6–2 in a match that took one hour and forty-five minutes."I'm so thrilled to play this kind of match and beat the number one player in the world," said Janković, who has won only one other event this year.

Justine went on to win the second set as well, despite first squandering six match points, thus winning her sixth title in the season leading up to the US Open."I think both of us played very well and there (were) a lot of great points,"a defeated Jankovic said. "A high level of tennis, so it was great for fans to see that and I really enjoyed it... But unfortunately at the end ... I couldn't hang in there with her.""It was tough at the end of the match," Henin confided to reporters. She also stated that she had received "intensive" physiotherapy  the morning prior to the match and had been unsure whether she could play. There was a lot of suspense and intensity and both of us played our best tennis at the end. We both had a lot of opportunities but fortunately I was able to come through in the end. I am very happy to win" she said, adding I had five matches and won them all in two sets so it has been a great week for me,".It is Henin's first tournament since Wimbledon, where she was knocked out in the semi-finals.Britain's Andy Murray today was defeated by Rafael Nadal, who is ranked as the second best tennis player in the world, in the quarter finals of the Wimbledon Championships. Nadal won by three sets to none. As the winner, Nadal will face Rainer Schuettler or Arnaud Clement in the final. Except for in the Australian Open, neither Schuettler or Clement have got past the quarter final of a major tournament, while Nadal has won several international competitions. Reaching the quarter finals is Murray's most successful run. Murray was born in Scotland in 1987 and he is currently Britain's highest ranked player, at number eleven worldwide. A successful run at Wimbledon would have meant that Murray's ranking would have risen higher.Nadal was born in Spain in 1986, and his ranking is second only to that of Roger Federer. He is well known for winning a record 81 consecutive clay court matches.Murray started the first set well, with him being close behind for much of the first half of the set. After Murray had won three games of the set, however, his play got worse and he lost the set 6-3. Nadal dominated much of the second set, and he got a clear lead at the early stages of the set. Murray, fought back unsuccessfully, although he managed to stay only one game behind Nadal at the early stages of the set. The set finished with Nadal winning by six games to two. The first game of the third set was won by Murray, although Nadal won the next game without letting his opponent score a single point. Murray almost broke serve in the third game, although he started to fall apart after he had won thirty points. The set's next three games were very similar to the first three, with the two opponents being on an equal score after six games. Nadal then won the next three games to take the match.Before the match, Murray said that he thought he had a chance of beating Nadal. "Obviously he's the favourite for the match but I do think that I can win," he said, speaking to BBC Sport.On Sunday at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, the "King of Clay" Rafael Nadal defeated Austrian tennis player Dominic Thiem 6–4 6–3 6–2 to claim his eleventh French Open title at the Philippe-Chatrier Court. Defending champion Nadal became the second athlete to win a particular Grand Slam event on eleven occasions, the first being Margaret Court at the Australian Open.24-year-old Dominic Thiem was playing his first ever Grand Slam final while Nadal, who won his first French Open title in 2005 at the age of nineteen, had never lost a French Open final.Thiem won the toss, choosing to receive the service. In the set lasting just over the one-hour mark, Thiem served two aces. The Austrian missed all four chances to win any of the net points, while Nadal won three out of four net points. Thiem committed three double faults in the set. In the second set, Thiem served three aces and committed just one double fault. Nadal won all but one net points in the second set lasting for 53 minutes. In the last set, Nadal broke Thiem's serve twice, and won all five net points in the set. The match lasted for two hours and 42 minutes.Just like last year, Nadal did not drop a single set in the final. Last year, Nadal defeated Stan Wawrinka 6–2 6–3 6–1 in the final to win his tenth French Open. Nadal extended his record at the French Open to 86–2, losing just two matches in fourteen seasons on the French soil.After the match, Nadal said, "It's amazing, I can't describe my feelings because it's not even a dream to win here eleven times. It's impossible to think something like this." Former French Open winner Ken Rosewall, the first player to win the French Open in the open era, presented the awards. Rosewall said, "Words can't express what we feel for Rafa's game and what he's done for the game on a worldwide basis".With this victory, Nadal now has seventeen Grand Slam titles. Only Roger Federer has three more titles than the Spaniard. Nadal is the only athlete to win a particular Grand Slam on eleven occasions in the open era.Yesterday, Spanish tennis player and world number 1 ranked Rafael Nadal withdrew from the ATP Paris Masters suffering from a knee injury.Nadal decided to leave the tournament in Paris for a flare-up of a right knee injury during the third round match against Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas in the Paris tournament. Nadal, who played the third set wearing a knee strap, said "the pain during the match was too much."The "King of Clay" said he would consult a doctor. Last year, Nadal withdrew from French Open suffering from a wrist injury. He missed significant time from the tennis season last year, but this year, Nadal became the first person to win a particular Grand Slam on ten occasions in the open era, winning the French Open for a record tenth time. He also won the US Open, his sixteenth grand slam title, but lost to Roger Federer in the ATP Shanghai Masters, last month.The Spaniard said he would "do his best" for the upcoming London tournament scheduled from November 12 to 19. Nadal said, "For me it's not about London. For me it's about the longer term[...] And longer term, I'm going to do the treatment I believe that is going to be more safe and more important to keep playing tennis as long as possible."Nadal has never won the Paris Masters tournament, and finished second only when he made his debut in the Paris Masters in 2007.

In April, the 36-year-old defender announced his desire to leave his boyhood club, Chelsea, after his contract ended with the London-based club.John Terry joined the Blues 22 years ago, and made his professional debut against Aston Villa in 1998. Since then, Terry has won fifteen trophies making 717 appearances for Chelsea. The only players who made more appearances for Chelsea were Ron Harris and Peter Bonetti. He has won the Premier League and FA Cup five times, EFL (English Football League) Cup thrice, and one each of UEFA Champions League and Europa League. Terry led Chelsea to the Premier League title in his final season.Terry said he did not want to play against Chelsea, and hence joined Aston Villa, who are in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. He said, "The mental side of playing against Chelsea was too much to get over for me. I was there for 22 years at the football club. I am very proud of that but this is a new chapter in my life and career."After signing the contract, Terry said, "My thoughts are 100% here and the ambition is to get us back to the Premier League. It's a huge club." Terry has been assigned jersey number 26, the number he wore on his back in his entire professional career. His contract with Chelsea expired on Friday.The University of Texas Longhorns won the Rose Bowl and the 2005 National Championship with a 41-38 victory over the University of Southern California Trojans.Texas quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate Vince Young sealed the win with an 8 yard run on fourth down with 5 yards to go and 19 seconds remaining. The Longhorns followed the play with a successful two-point conversion.Young rushed for 200 yards and passed for 267 yards in the game; his combined 467 total yards of offense set a Rose Bowl record. The victory by the Longhorns ended USC's 34-game winning streak — then the longest in the nation. With the win, the Longhorns now control the longest streak at 20 wins. The Trojans, coached by Pete Carroll, came into the game ranked no. 1 in both the BCS and AP polls. Considering USC's streak and the Longhorns no. 2 ranking, the Texas victory was considered an upset.The morning of the victory President George W. Bush called Texas coach Mack Brown to congratulate the Longhorns and their victory.Texas Tech coach Mike Leach is reportedly interested in taking the vacant head football coaching job at the University of Miami, numerous sources have reported.As early as Dec. 1, reports were filtering out that Leach was open to discussing the job. Over the weekend, message boards and blogs were openly discussing the possibility that the coach, known for his wide-open offenses while at Tech, will make the jump to the Hurricanes.Leach, whose Red Red Raiders went 7-5 this season, is slated to coach in the Insight Bowl on Dec. 29.Female boxing champion Samson Sor Siriporn was released on parole from prison Pathum Thani, Thailand today, after serving five years of a seven-year term on a drug conviction.

The torch will travel across Italy transported by more than 10'000 carriers and it will arrive in Turin on February 9, 2006, where the Winter Olympics will be inaugurated, after 11'000 km (6,835 miles) of travel.On November 27 the flame was burned on the altar of Hestia in Olympia, in Greece, and delivered to the first torch carrier, pole vaulter Kostas Fidippidis. The first Italian to carry the olympic flame is the marathoner Stefano Baldini, winner of gold medal at the Olympics in Athens. He received the torch from the President of the Italian Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.Today, Arsenal have confirmed that they will be adding Theo Walcott to their side, after a 12.5 million pound deal was struck, on the premise that he pass rigorous medical examinations. Although the 16-year-old striker cannot sign until he turns 17 on 16 March, Wenger seems to see this only as a formality, as the player is set to be unveiled today at Highbury.Although there are not many other details at this moment, it is thought that he will not be able to return to Southampton on loan, due to the hectic schedule that he will have at Arsenal. Whatever way the deal may turn out, it seems that Theo's family are with him whatever he does.17 year old Arsenal FC striker Theo Walcott is the biggest surprise in England national team coach Sven-Göran Eriksson's preliminary pick for the FIFA World Cup 2006 in Germany. Injured Wayne Rooney is also one of the players in the squad.Theo Walcott hasn't yet played a Premier League game but Eriksson thinks that the team needs players with Walcott's pace. Eriksson decided this morning to pick Walcott ahead of players like Darren Bent and Jermain Defoe. When he named Walcott there were a lot of surprised journalists in the press conference room. "Sometimes you do it on feelings as well and I am excited about Theo Walcott," Eriksson said at the press conference.He consulted his assistant coach Tord Grip and Arsenal FC coach Arsene Wenger when he picked Walcott. Wenger, who in January convinced the Arsenal FC directors to transfer Walcott from Southampton FC, is impressed of what he has seen of him.Walcott's former mentor, Huw Jennings, agrees with Sven-Göran Eriksson. "He has got tremendous ability and pace, which England are short of," Jennings said in an interview with the BBC.As expected, Wayne Rooney was picked despite his severe injury. Eriksson thinks he should be in the team as the world class player he is. If Rooney isn't expected to be fit enough to play in the tournament he can be replaced, but that has to be done before June 9.Michael Owen is expected to train with the national team from Monday. Ledley King was not picked for the squad due to an injury and hasn't been able to train.Tottenham Hotspur FC coach Martin Jol is amazed that Jermain Defoe is not in the squad but he still believes that he will be there, referring to the situation with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen. Charlton striker Darren Bent says on his agents' website that he is disappointed to be overlooked. The final squad must be announced by May 15.The Third Ashes test ended in a draw as England ended 1 wicket short of victory. A captain's innings of 156 by Ricky Ponting helped Australia save the game on the fifth day. When Ponting was dismissed with four overs to go a tense endgame ensued as England sought the final wicket but Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath fought to deny them that prize.Earlier in the game the batsmen held sway as the third test saw the first centuries of the series from England's Michael Vaughan (166) and Andrew Strauss (106). With England setting Australia an unlikely 423 to win in just over a day it was Ponting's 156 that was the most significant contribution as he batted for six hours to deny England a second consecutive victory.The series remains at 1-1 with two matches to play.Scores: England 444 and 280-6 dec. Australia 302 and 371-9Norwegian cyclist Thor Hushovd sprinted his way to a stage four victory in the 2007 Tour de France on Wednesday.Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland maintained the overall lead, while Hushovd moved into second place, 29 seconds behind Cancellara.Cancellara is not confident of keeping the yellow jersey. "When I get into the mountains, it's sure that it's finished," Cancellara said.Danish mountain specialist, and "King of the Mountains" for 2005 and 2006, Michael Rasmussen agrees that the Alps will be a turning point in the race."We'll definitely get some answers on those days," Rasmussen said. "Already on the Colombiere [La Colombiere Pass], there will be guys from the general classification maybe even dropping or being in trouble."French mountain specialist Remy Di Gregorio withdrew from the Tour after fracturing his elbow during stage 4.An estimated two thousand people from the skateboarding and surfing communities, and a Wikinews reporter, attended the funeral service and memorial paddle-out and skateboarding session this past Labor Day weekend in California for skateboarding pioneer Jay Adams, who died on August 15 while on a surfing trip with his wife Tracy in Puerto Escondido, Mexico.  Within days after his death several smaller Hawaiian-style paddle-out tributes were also held in his honor from Santa Cruz, California to Jacksonville, Florida.Broadcast live on the web from Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa on Friday, pastor Raul Ries delivered the eulogy along with Skateboarder Christian Hosoi.  Both spoke about Adams character and influence on the skateboarding and surfing communities.  Adams' own church pastor and one of his closest friends Trip shared personal stories from letters Adams had written him concerning his faith and his desire to be known for being a man of God.  Adams' step-father Kent Sherwood who taught Adams how to surf when he was just three years old, also shared personal stories about Adams when he was just starting to surf and skateboard as a young child.With clear skies and warm sunny weather on Saturday, hundreds of surfers, amongst them long time friends of Adam's from the Z-Boys, held a large memorial paddle-out tribute mid-day on the north side of the Venice Beach Pier.  Chants of "Jay Jay Jay" could be heard from the pier as onlookers watched water being splashed about into the air by the hundreds of people perched on their surfboards.  Los Angeles County fire department boats and lifeguards were on hand to add to the paddle-out by spraying their water cannons high into the air and blowing their horns, while monitoring everyone's safety.  Later in the afternoon nearby a skateboarding session was held at the Venice beach skate park also in Adams' honor.Adams became an influential figure in skateboarding and its culture during the mid-seventies when he was a teenager, skateboarding with the Zephyr team in Southern California.  He has been acknowledged as someone who helped transform the novelty of skateboarding into a global phenomenon.  His story was featured in the films Dogtown and Z-Boys and Lords of Dogtown and he was inducted into the skateboarding hall of fame in 2012.Later in life Adams became a Christian and found a purpose in helping the next generation of skaters and surfers by speaking to the public with positive messages about making good choices in life, along with other notable skateboarder Dennis Martinez.  Adams is the second member of the Z-Boys to die this year, Shogo Kubo died while surfing in Hawaii in June.He is survived by his wife Tracy, his son Seven and his daughter Venice.Yesterday in Lausanne, Switzerland, three cities, Tokyo, Istanbul and Madrid, submitted their official bid books to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as part of their efforts to secure the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics for their cities.The books contain each city's plans for the Games as they relate to key hosting aspects such as venues, budgets, financial guarantees, security, accommodations, and transportation.  These are scheduled to be made public today.  The host city is to be named on September 7 at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, where a new IOC President is also to be chosen. All the bids are being viewed against a backdrop of the global economic downturn, with hosting costs and the national economy possibly playing a role in voter decision-making.Baku in Azerbaijan and Doha in Qatar took part in the first stage of the bid process but were eliminated from contention in May at a meeting of the IOC's Executive Board in Quebec City, Canada. Rome had considered a bid but withdrew early in the process because of Italian economic concerns.  An IOC report said Istanbul's bid "offers good potential" while  Madrid had "a strong application" and Tokyo had "a very strong application."Bookmakers have given Tokyo best odds to receive the Games at 4/6 compared to 5/2 for Istanbul and 3/1 for Madrid.  Tokyo's bid delegation included a member of the women's FIFA World Cup champions Homare Sawa, 2008 Summer Paralympics swimming gold medalist Takayuki Suzuki, President of Tokyo 2020 and Japanese Olympic Committee Tsunekazu Takeda, bid chief executive Masato Mizuno, senior director for planning for sports at Tokyo 2020 Katsura Enyo, and a member of the Executive Board for Tokyo's bid Yasuhiro Nakamori.  Tokyo last hosted the Olympics in 1964 and had previously won the rights to host the later canceled 1940 Summer Olympics. This is their second consecutive bid, having lost to Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Bid organizers believe the Games would be an uplifting force for a country still recovering from a natural disaster in 2011.  A possible complication to Tokyo's bid is territorial disputes with China. Sawa is quoted by Inside the Games, an Olympic and Paralympics news site, saying, "I want to feel that deeply moving spirit from the London Games once again in Tokyo, [...] I want to do all I can."Takeda is quoted by Inside the Games saying of the bid, "With tremendous support from people in Tokyo and across Japan, we have celebrated a memorable milestone today with the submission of our Candidature file, [...] Based on lessons from our bid for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, we have retained the best of that bid plan while adding important new strengths. Now that our Candidature file is complete, Tokyo is one step closer to implementing an innovative and inspiring Games plan. The Games in 2020 in Tokyo will offer athletes, spectators and Olympic and Paralympic family members a true once-in-a-lifetime experience." Most of the infrastructure for a Tokyo Games has been built, which assists in keeping costs down as the world economy is a potential concern for financing the Games.  Takeda remarked, "Many of our venues are in place; most of the games infrastructure is in place and the $4.5 billion budget to complete these tasks is already in the bank." Despite Tokyo's positive early response from the IOC, there is no guarantee the city will be selected as previous early favourites have failed to win hosting rights when it came down to the final vote. Amongst possible concerns, their bid could be undermined by South Korea's hosting of the 2018 Winter Olympics. Istanbul are bidding for the fifth time, with this bid viewed as their most competitive and serious one to date. Their bid was presented by the city's mayor, Kadir Topbaş, the bid leader Hasan Arat, President of the National Olympic Committee of Turkey and president of the World Archery Federation Uğur Erdener, Deputy Undersecretary of the Minister of Youth and Sports Yavuz Çelik, and general director of sports for Istanbul 2020 Mehmet Baykan. Their bid calls for the largest Opening Ceremonies in Olympic Games history, with a ceremony on the European and Asian banks of the Bosphorus involving a half million people.  Istanbul's bid calls for events to be held on two continents, which the bid organizers believe gives them an advantage of Madrid and Japan,  as this fits within the framework of the Olympic ideal. That they have not hosted the Games previously is another potential positive as the most recent successful bids for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were in cities that had never hosted them before.  Turkey's bid is bolstered by having successfully hosted the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics and the FINA World Short Course Swimming Championships last year. The strength of the Turkish economy is also seen as a positive with their bid going forward. Their bid is hurt by ongoing disputes with Syria that has resulted in 150,000 Syrian refugees living on the Turkish side of the border. Arat is quoted by Inside the Games on the bid saying, "This milestone is the latest step in our 20-year journey to win the honour of hosting the Games, [...] For the very first time, our desire to host the Games is matched by our capacity. We have been learning and evolving every step of the way, and today we are submitting a brand new and dramatically enhanced Games concept. Istanbul 2020 has a technically outstanding master plan and delivery structure, and we would grab the world's attention with a breathtaking setting and a series of groundbreaking firsts, such as being the first ever Games held in two continents simultaneously. Now is the time for Istanbul; now we are ready to deliver."  Istabul's mayor Topbaş arrived at the last minute to assist in the bid submission despite bad winter weather in Istanbul. Quoted by  Inside the Games, he said of the city's bid, "Today is a historic moment for Istanbul and the Turkish nation, [...] Istanbul 2020 is the first sports bid in Turkish history to have been officially launched by the Prime Minister, and it has been identified as a strategic national priority. As such, this bid has the unequivocal backing of every level of Government. [...] The Games would enhance Istanbul's growing global status as a place to visit, do business and, increasingly, stage world-class sport, [...] We are all aligned behind our shared vision: hosting the Games for the first time would be the defining achievement in nearly 100 years of the Republic of Turkey."Madrid's bid comes at a time when the Spanish economy is in the middle of a second recession where unemployment hovers around 25 per cent and on the heels of two previous failed bids. Bid organizers believe the Games could serve as an economic driver for the country. Juan Antonio Samaranch Salisachs, International Triathlon Union President and IOC member Marisol Casado, International Canoe Federation President and IOC member José Perurena López, Madrid mayor Ana Botella, Madrid's bid leader and the president of the Spanish Olympic Committee Alejandro Blanco, President of the Sports Council Miguel Cardenal, the Councillor for Education, Sports and Youth with the Madrid Regional Government  Lucia Figar, and two-time Olympic gold medal sailor Theresa Zabell were part of the Madrid bid delegation.  In submitting their bid, they gave a half-hour presentation to the IOC's head of Bid City Relations Jacqueline Barrett and Executive Director of the Olympic Games Gilbert Felli. Madrid's mayor is quoted by Inside the Games on the bid as "a project the whole country is behind and a dream for all Spaniards [...] The proof can be seen in the fact that three levels of Government are represented here — the city, the regional and the national. We are here to give our support to the countless people who are working for and believe in Madrid's Olympic aspirations."Like Tokyo, much of the sport-related infrastructure for a Madrid-hosted Games already exists.  This would keep infrastructure costs down and make the Games more affordable for Spain. Their bid is the least expensive of all the submitted bids. London's recent hosting of the Games is seen as potentially harmful to their bid because two Games in Europe within only a few Olympic cycles runs counter to traditional Games hosting. The IOC's Evaluation Commission is scheduled to visit each city in March, with their first scheduled visit starting March 4 in Tokyo, then starting March 18 in Madrid and wrapping up their city visits starting March 24 in Istanbul.  Following their visits, the Commission is to write and submit a report to IOC membership by July 4 to assist voters in making their decision.Three top FIFA (International Federation of Association Football) officials have been suspended from their jobs yesterday for a period of ninety days pending an internal inquiry into alleged corruption. The three are FIFA President Sepp Blatter, Vice President Michel Platini and Secretary General Jérôme Valcke. They aren't allowed to participate in football-related activities during their suspensions.Blatter was going to serve as president until February 2016, although he was elected to a five year term on May 29 this year.The suspensions have been issued by FIFA's Independent Ethics Committee, in the wake of the decision of Swiss authorities to investigate possible criminal charges against Blatter. The authorities are looking into an "unfavourable" contract signed by Blatter and a "disloyal payment" involving Platini. Valcke was already suspended from his job, allegedly involved in a controversy about FIFA World Cup tickets. These followed a US investigation in May 2015, which implicated fourteen FIFA employees in bribery and racketeering, and a Swiss inquiry about the conduct of the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process.The ethics committee has the power to increase the length of the suspensions by a further forty five days if it deems this necessary. The suspensions would then end just days before FIFA holds elections for a new president, for which Platini is a possible candidate. However, there have been calls for the reform of FIFA, by major sponsors and the International Olympic Committee, whose president, Thomas Bach, said "enough is enough".Three foreign journalists in South Africa have been robbed at gunpoint while they slept in their chalet in Magaliesburg, Gauteng.

Shortly after the interview and talking to people, Abbott and his advisors left the event due to his tight schedule.A total of 2988 people competed, with 788 bicycle riders and 2200 runners and walkers, a 20 per cent increase from last year and making this year’s fun run the largest since the first Lake to Lagoon was held in 2006.In the open men's category, first place went to James Davy who finished across the line at 30 minutes 15 seconds, second place went to Matthew Ho finishing in 31 minutes 16 seconds, and in third place was Caleb Noble at 31 minutes 50 seconds.

The event, entitled Winter Whackdown, featured the hosting association — the Coastal Assassins Roller Derby (CARD) — fielding two teams, the Toowoomba Range Renegades and the Brisbane City Rollers Punk Blockers.Upon arrival, the spectators were still filing into the stadium.The opening bout between the CARD Ace Invaders and the Toowoomba Range Renegades started around 5:15pm local time (0715 UTC).

The Punk Blockers won 215 points to 127.One month ago, the French soccer team took its revenge over Italy (World cup title holders) but the gap to stay number one remains slim.Most of this margin is only due to the victory over Brazil in Mondial quarter finals but any further loss (not expected against Faroë Islands next Wednesday) is enough not to stay in the leading chair.Both teams are likely to be hoping for a draw as the worst result, which would leave the situation as:Scotland top of the round-robin group;France World #1.After lots of turns on the route of torch relay of 2008 Summer Olympics, Taiwan and China still insisted their own political positions.  The IOC finally announced yesterday that the torch's route will not cross Taiwan.After the route was fixed by IOC, politicians and governments in Taiwan criticized China's behavior. One of Taiwan's 2008 presidential candidates, Ying-jiou Ma (former Taipei City Mayor), commented that without the torch, he can not welcome the torch with National Song and Flag of the Republic of China.  Also, Chih-hsiung Huang (KMT Legislator) supposed that Mainland China and Democratic Progressive Party should be criticized on this fault.At the governmental level, Ming-tung Chen (Commissioner of Mainland Affairs Council of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China) mentioned that people in Taiwan do not accept the request on welcoming the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics without Flags, Symbols, and the National Song of the Republic of China, based on the cross-strait common consensus on February 12, 2007.  Chun-hsiung Chang (Premier of the Republic of China) hoped that this fault won't take effect on the tourism between China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Chih-Wei Hsieh (Minister of the Government Information Office of the Republic of China) was proud of the protection of democracy and human rights in Taiwan even though the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics won't come to Taiwan.According to Eastern Television in Taiwan, the reciprocal consensus' between China and Taiwan became cracked slowly, especially in such sporting events as:Flag of the Republic of China was shown at Davis Cup in Taiwan at April, Cross-Strait Golf Championship and Asian Volleyball Championship at July.  This was said to anger the Mainland China National Team.Mainland China National Team withdrew the 2007 World Deaf Swimming Championship and YONEX 2007 Chinese Taipei Badminton Open.Ta Meng (Basketball Player of Jiangsu Nangang Team) deliberately elbowed Tai-Hao Wu at Cross-Strait Basketball Championship on September 4, 2007, and caused some spectators in Taiwan to protest Chinese Taipei Basketball Association and China by drawing Flags of the Republic of China.This Olympic Torch is first-ever declined by an IOC member without warfare factor, even though IOC won't punish Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), but this indicates that the 2008 Summer Olympics may be more faded with politics than previously has occurred.  The effects are indicated to be notable after Executive Yuan of Taiwan will promote the "Torch of Joining UN" in October 2007 and the "Human Rights Torch Relay" project by Taiwan newspaper Epoch Times in June 2008.Torino and Messina are facing the risk of expulsion from Serie A because of fraud. Both clubs submitted false financial information to the Serie A management.Covisoc, the body who must ratify that all clubs have the funds necessary to be registered for the new season, have found problems with both outfits.As it stands now, they are not part of the Italian First Division but the pair have submitted an appeal on July 12 against the initial decision.A final verdict on whether the clubs can compete in the top-flight next term is expected on July 15.Numerous other clubs in lower Divisions are facing similar problems, with Perugia and Salernitana risking demotion from Serie B. A total of 20 clubs are in trouble in Serie C.New signing Laurent Robert and the return of Greg Sutton were not enough for Toronto F.C. as they fell 4-1 to D.C. United in Washington. Early goals from Luciano Emilio and Santino Quaranta left Toronto in an uphill battle for the rest of the match. The hill only became bigger in the 22nd minute when Kevin Harmse put in a hard challenge on Gonzalo Peralta and was subsequently sent off. Marcelo Gallardo then made it 3-0 for the home side in the 52nd minute. Quaranta crossed the ball and Gallardo was wide open to smash the ball into an open net. Jaime Moreno capped off the scoring for D.C. in the 78th before Edu opened Toronto's MLS account with his first goal of the season. The loss leaves Toronto at 0-2-0 on the season, while DC pick up their first win after losing their opener. DC now travel to play Real Salt Lake, while Toronto will visit David Beckham and the L.A. Galaxy.File:Air Canada Center.jpgThe struggling Toronto Maple Leafs National Hockey League team is under new, interim management this week.  Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr. was replaced by Cliff Fetcher. Ferguson's contract was due to expire at the end of June. Fletcher was the Leafs' General Manager from 1991 to 1997.The new management began on a positive note as the Leafs won 3-2 over the Washington Capitals on Wednesday.In their first home match of the new season, Tottenham Hotspur won against newly promoted side Sheffield United, 2-0. The FA Premier League game was settled early in the first half by strikes from Dimitar Berbatov and Jermaine Jenas.The London side started very brightly, showing their attacking intent. This paid off for Tottenham after just seven minutes.A perfectly judged pass from Robbie Keane found Aaron Lennon on the right side of the penalty area. Lennon's low cross was tapped in from close range by the waiting Berbatov.Berbatov was signed by Spurs in the summer from Bayern Leverkusen for £10.9 million. This was his first competitive goal for Tottenham, after finding the net several times in pre-season matches.Nine minutes later, Tottenham struck again. Jenas received a header on from Berbatov, knocked the ball around United keeper Paddy Kenny and tapped in to double the lead.Spurs pressed for a third goal, but were unsuccessful as Young-Pyo Lee, Calum Davenport and Robbie Keane all missed opportunities.Despite this, Spurs looked comfortable in dealing with occasional threats from the Blades, missing the influence of manager Neil Warnock who was serving part of a suspension. Substitutions by United were not enough to turn around the result.Current yellow jersey, Michael Rasmussen has been withdrawn from the 2007 Tour de France by his team Rabobank for lying to the team about his whereabouts in June, saying he was in Mexico while he was, in fact, in Italy. An Italian Tour de France commentator mentioned he had met Rasmussen in June on a training camp in Italy.It has been reported that the hotel, where Rabobank's team was staying, was raided and searched late Wednesday by the police. There is no word on whether the search turned up anything.Rasmussen had come under heavy fire for having received four warnings from cycling authorities before the race, because of him failing to inform about his whereabouts.Before today's stage, which he won, Rasmussen said: "I want to make absolutely clear I've had out-of-competition tests prior to the Tour de France, 14 tests during the Tour and all the results are negative ... I do support my team in the fight against doping and [for] a clean sport.""Michael Rasmussen has been sent home for violating the team's internal rules," said Rabobank spokesman Jacob Bergsma.According to Danish news channel TV 2 News, the rest of the Rabobank team will be allowed to finish the race if they wish to do so. TV 2 News also says Rasmussen has left Rabobank's hotel.Davide Cassani, a former Tour de France cyclist and now a TV commentator for Italy, said that he had seen Rasmussen in the Dolomites area of the Alps on both June 13 and 14, 2007. Rasmussen had filed information with his team that he was in Mexico from June 4 through June 26.Akio Toyoda, the President and Representative Director of Toyota, made a statement on Wednesday that the company is leaving the Formula One championship before the 2010 season. The primary factor behind this decision was said to be the current economic environment in the midterm perspective.Panasonic Toyota Racing did not manage to ever win a Formula One race, winning only 13 podium and 278.5 points since 2002. Toyota will still be present in a number of racing series, including Formula Nippon, Formula Three, Super GT and NASCAR.Another major Japanese automotive giant, Honda, quit Formula One prior to this season and sold the team to Ross Brawn. The renewed team Brawn GP with Mercedes-Benz engined cars won the 2009 Constructors' Championship recently.Other Japanese companies Subaru and Suzuki withdrew from the World Rally Championship prior to this season and Kawasaki pulled out of MotoGP.The space cleared by Toyota may be now used by the BMW Sauber team's possible successor if BMW can reach an agreement to sell the team after their decision to quit Formula One earlier this year. Toyota drivers of this season Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock, as well as the Japanese rookie driver Kamui Kobayashi, could now look for seats in other teams for 2010 including the new entries US F1, Campos, Manor or Lotus.Traralgon bounced back after their loss to Morwell with a 73 point victory over Sale in round thirteen of the Gippsland Football League.The Gippsland League is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total).Traralgon's defence held strong as the team went inside their attacking fifty 63 times to Sales 57. Sale, however, lead the centre clearances 35 to Traralgon's 27.

However, 24 hours later, Maffra defeated Sale by 44 points. The Gippsland Football League, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region, according to the Victorian Country Football League.Warragul kicked both of its goals in the first half, still conceivably in the contest at that point thanks to Traralgon's inaccurate seven goals and ten behinds. The hosts kicked five goals in the third quarter to extend their lead to ten goals.At the end of the day, Traralgon won 20-13 (136) to Warragul's 2-6 (18).Drouin played Morwell in the other match played on Saturday. On Sunday, Maffra hosted Sale in Maffra, and Moe hosted Wonthaggi in Morwell to complete the round.Traralgon reclaimed some pride with a thirteen point victory against Drouin at the Traralgon Recreation Reserve and Showground. As a result, Drouin move to fifth on the Gippsland Football League ladder and Traralgon reduce Maffra's lead on to to one game. The Gippsland Football League (officially Gippsland League) is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total).A sturggling Drouin defence allowed early goals to Tim Johnston and Dan McKenna. The visitors struggled to get the ball out of their backline as Traralgon kicked and inaccurate three goals and six behinds. Drouin kicked two late goals to keep in the contest.Drouin kicked five goals in the second quarter to take a fourteen point lead into half time, thanks to dominant midfield porformances of Andy Soumilas and Pat McGrath.Steve Hazelman swung Nic Quenault onto McGrath with immediate success. McGrath gathered mandy poccessions but was not as effective as he was in the first half.Traralgon got back into the match leading at the end of the third and went on to win 10-11 (71) to 8-10 (58).Traralgon remain the only undefeated team after five rounds of the 2010 Gippsland Football League season after they defeated Warragul by seventy points and Sale defeated Maffra by one point. Warragul remain the only team without a win.The Gippsland Football League (officially Gippsland League) is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.In other games, Morwell defeated Drouin and Moe defeated Wonthaggi.After five rounds, the standings are;Traralgon (five wins, no losses - 166.67%)Maffra (four wins, one loss - 150.8%)Sale (three wins, one loss, one bye - 126.32%)Morwell (three wins, two losses - 115.62%)Drouin (two wins, two losses, one bye - 128.28%)Moe (one win, three losses, one bye - 85.58%)Leongatha (one win, three losses, one bye - 68.82%)Wonthaggi (one win, four losses - 46.68%)Warragul (no wins, four losses, one bye - 48.6%)Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total).Warragul lead Traralgon early in the third quarter but were quickly over taken and convincingly beaten.To that point in the game, the defence of both sides dominated not allowing many scoring opportunities. From the fifth minute of the third quarter, the game belonged to Traralgon.Tim Aitkin kicked six of his nine goals in the last quarter to help Traralgon stamp their authority on the game.Sale upset ladder leaders Maffra at home. One could have argued that Maffra's inaccurate kicking in the second half cost it the win.To the end of the third, Maffra lead but could not close out the match. Sale won the match with a goal from a free kick after the full time siren.Traralgon defeated Wonthaggi this past Saturday in round two of the Gippsland Football League (officially Gippsland League, GL). Traralgon came off a thirty eight point win against Moe with Wonthaggi beating Leongatha by a single point.With two goals separating the teams at the end of the first quarter and three and half time, Wonthaggi looked like they could upset the 2009 Grand Finalists. Traralgon, however, had other ideas, pushing their lead to five goals at the end of the third quarter and kicking five goals and six behinds to Wonthaggi's sole behind in the final quarter.In other round two matches, Warrgul lost to Sale, Leongatha lost to Morwell, and Maffra defeated Moe.The Gippsland Football League is considered one of the "major leagues" controlled by the Victorian Country Football League, the governing body of Australian rules football in regional Victoria, Australia.At the league's annual general meeting in December, it changed it's name from the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League. At the same meeting, Wonthaggi joined the GL after dominating the Alberton Football League during the past decade. Wonthaggi made five concecutive Alberton Grand Finals winning three, losing only to Yarram (2007) and Stony Creek (2009).Wonthaggi Power Football Club is a result of a merger between Wonthaggi Blues, a former Gippsland FL team, and Wonthaggi Rovers, an Alberton FL team. In February, the Gippsland Football League announced that Wonthaggi would be changing their uniforms, because their original one was similar to that of Warragul.In the hills of Weiswampach, Luxembourg yesterday, the 12th International Wämper Triathlon became the setting for the national championship Olympic distance (1,5 km swimming, 40 km cycling, 10 km running) triathlon for both Belgium and Luxembourg. The Belgian championship was scheduled to take place in Vilvoorde, Belgium, but because the concentration of Salmonella bacteria in the water was too high, the Belgians moved to Luxembourg.On Saturday, an event for children and for the handicapped took place, along with the 10 kilometre running event. On Sunday, the Juniors and the athletes for the Promotion race started the day, followed at 15:00 by the elite athletes. Even though dark clouds hung over Weiswampach most of the afternoon, there was only a short rain shower during the cycling course.In the men's race, Peter Croes (Belgium, Atriac team) and Dirk Bockel (Luxembourg, Celtic Diekirck team) started together for the final 10 kilometre run, but Bockel managed to outrun Croes by 23 seconds, prolonging his victory of last year. Last year's winner, Stijn Goris from Belgium (LTTL team), came in third, followed closely by Bas Diederen from the Netherlands. Lander Dircken (Atriac, Belgium) came in fifth.In the women's race, the top two athletes remained the same as last year; Elisabeth "Liz" May from Luxembourg managed to stay ahead of a pursuing group the entire race, and finished first ahead of Jessica Mayon. Mayon secured the title of Belgian 1/4 Triathlon champion, in addition to the previously won Sprint Triathlon and Long Distance championships. Evelyn Williamson from New Zealand finished third.Today, the open national championship Olympic distance triathlon has been held in Belgium in the city of Kortrijk, West Flanders. The 1.5 km swim (0.93 mi), 40 km bicycle race (24.8 mi) and 10 km run (6.2 mi) turned out to be a thriller event in both the men's and the ladies' event.The new Belgian champion Simon Decuyper was only 13th out of the water but was the fastest to complete the 4 bicycle laps, with still energy left to catch up with and run away from Stijn Goris halfway the second of three laps. Lander Dircken finished third, beating Marc Geerts by only a few meters in the final spurt. Geerts, who won last year in Kortrijk, may have lost a precious 30 seconds when he fell with his bike upon entering the transition area -fortunately not sustaining any serious injuries. Local athlete Bart Colpaert came in fifth.In the women's race, a group of eight women came out of the water within a minute of each other, among them winner Joke Coysman and Katrien Verstuyft who finished third. In this drafting race, Coysman soon took the lead in the cycling in a group of four. Behind them, Sofie Goos managed to close in with the help of Marjolein Truyers. Goos managed to run past everyone except Coysman, and Truyers managed to take fourth place before Christel Van Eesbeek.In the category up to 18 years old, Gilles Cottyn and Jolien Lewyllie took the gold medal. In the age group 40 and older, Gert Goedhart and Christel Van Eesbeek won. In the category 50+, Luc Geerts (Marc Geerts' father) fulfilled his favorite's role.Weather conditions were favourable with only a few rainshowers during the footrace. Mayor Stefaan De Clerck handed out the medals.In what might amount to one of the shocks of the tournament Trinidad and Tobago drew with Sweden 0-0 in the second Group B match, Saturday, despite having a defender sent off.Lars Largerback's Swedish side failed to break a high-energy team marshalled with great confidence from midfield by the Trinidadian captain Dwight Yorke. Some excellent defending from Carlos Edwards and the Caribbean back four managed to keep out its European rivals for a famous first ever point in the World Cup tournament for the small island country.Trinidad and Tobago started the game with a reserve goalkeeper after first choice Kelvin Jack was injured after warming up. But Shaka Hislop produced a string of outstanding saves, which included one 11 minutes from time when he stuck out a hand to stop Marcus Allback placing the ball over him.The sending off of Avery John, after getting booked for a second time for a lunge, this time on Christian Wilhelmsson on 46 minutes, did not stop the Soca Warriors. In reply Leo Benhakker changed to a more attacking 4-3-2 system and threw on an extra attacker.The West Indies team led by Yorke was competitive and hard in the tackle but Swedish pressure meant the team was in its own half of the pitch most of the game. The team had few chances on goal because its attacking plays were few; but one shot from substitute Cornell Glen clipped the crossbar to the glee of supporters.Sweden made many goalscoring chances but its strikers must feel unfortunate that none were converted. Rami Shaaban in the Sweden goal did not have a save to make. A statistic that says much for the dominance of the Swedish yellow jerseys is that Sweden had eight corner kicks to Trinidad and Tobago's one.Martin Truex Jr. was welcomed with a firework celebration into Gatorade Victory Lane at Daytona International Speedway late Friday night as the winner of the NASCAR Busch series Winn-Dixie 250 race.  Truex Jr. lead for most of the race, first taking the lead position at lap 21.Four fighter jets from the Connecticut Air National Guard flew over the track after the national anthem, a NASCAR tradition for races.The race got off to a rocky start for some, such as the #64 car driven by Jeremy Mayfield pit early twice, once on lap four and another one lap after.  On lap 13, the #60 car driven by Carl Edwards spun through the grass near Turns 1 and 2 after being hit by Truex Jr, sending the race into a caution.Truex Jr. fought for the lead on lap 21 with his car owner Dale Earnhardt Jr., where Truex passed Earnhardt on the high end of Turn 4.  Earnhardt would later slip back to the third position two laps later.Lap 37 started with a smoking run into the pits by Kyle Krisiloff and his #5 car after a break malfunction, which led to him exceeding the speed limit placed by NASCAR on pit road.  Seven laps later, JJ Yaley's #18 car stalled on the track and coasted into the garage.Nextel cup veteran driver Sterling Marlin's front right tire gave out on lap 56, sending the race into yet another caution for the night.  The race was then silent until lap 78, when Earnhardt came into contact with driver Paul Menard of the #11 car coming off turn 4, causing Earnhardt to spin.  Earnhardt did not return to the race after the incident, believed to be the cause of a broken transmission from the spin.  A caution was issued.It would be 10 laps until another caution would be issued, this time for the rookie Michel Jourdain Jr. in his #10 car, after he spins after coming in contact with two other cars.  After the caution, a three-car leadership of Greg Biffle, Kevin Harvick and Truex Jr. would lead the remainder of the race, with each of them taking a turn leading.A major crash caused by #34, driven by Randy LaJoie, resulted in an 8-car pileup along the backstretch on lap 97, sending the race into its final caution of the night.  A red flag was issued on lap 99, freezing the field of any movement or alterations with the cars.  The race finally resumed almost 20 minutes later, with a green-white-checkered finish led by Truex Jr.Yesterday Tunisian star swimmer Oussama Mellouli was stripped by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, of his world championship and another world championships silver medal from the 2007 World Aquatics Championship, which was held in Melbourne, Australia, in March.He was also suspended for 18 months retroactive to 30 November 2006 – all for testing positive for amphetamine, after using the drug Adderall, which aids concentration levels, and which is widely used by college students when cramming for exams.A few weeks after the conclusion of the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne in late March 2007, reports began to surface that Mellouli had tested positive for a banned substance at the US Open in November  2006. These reports surfaced because FINA, the international governing body of the sport, had discovered that Tunisian authorities had known about the positive test and only given him a warning. The rules state that when an athlete tests positive for a banned substance, he or she must be given a 2 year ban from the sport. Therefore, FINA had taken the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Finally, after months of speculation, yesterday Oussama Mellouli lost his case before that Court.He escaped the worst possible punishment, because the timing and the retroactive status of the suspension give Mellouli a chance to compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he is a favorite in several medium distance races.  However, he loses the distinction of having become the first Arab world champion in the history of competitive swimming (in 800 m freestyle), and loses another silver medal (in 400 m freestyle) from his best-ever showing at the Australian world championships.London, England — Yesterday, with less than a day before the start of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the Turkey men's national wheelchair basketball team practiced at the Basketball Arena in London's Olympic Park.  Turkey's campaign starts on Thursday in a game against the United States men's national wheelchair basketball team.Tuesday, para-alpine skiers from twelve countries competed on the second day of the IPC Nor-Am Cup at Copper Mountain. 106 competitors, 29 women and 77 men, from countries such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Great Britain, Iceland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Turkey, and the United States competed in the Super G on the second day of the IPC Nor-Am Cup. Of those 106 competitors, five did not start, at least two did not qualify, and at least twenty five did not finish.Para-alpine skiers were back on the slopes again yesterday.Two jockeys have been killed in a fire in a block of flats on Saturday. At 0200 BST on Saturday a fire broke out in a three-storey block of apartments in Buckrose Court near Malton, North Yorkshire, England.  The two jockeys have been identified as Jamie Kyne, who was only 18, and Jan Wilson, who was just 19.  Both were described as promising young jockeys.Two other men had also been taken to a hospital in York due to the effects of minor burns and smoke inhalation. One of the men has now been released from the hospital and the other man's injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.A police investigation is currently taking place in the area and a man in his 30s living in the area has since been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent. North Yorkshire Police are going to interview the man and try and establish whether he was involved or not.Kyne was due to ride at Haydock on Saturday afternoon, while Wilson was due to ride at Thirsk on the same day, while riding her mother's horse, Imperial Sword — and so both were staying in the apartment as a means of accommodation, as Jamie came from Ireland and Jan was from Forfar, Scotland.  "The family are devastated and Jamie was a star," Kyne's aunt said.  "They [his parents] are so proud of him.  At the moment they are just devastated and shocked."David Barron, Wilson's trainer, paid tribute to her as "a tremendous jockey". He said: “She was just at the start of her career and was only in her first year of riding as an apprentice. She joined me at the end of last year and had ridden three winners for me out of only a handful of rides. She was very good, very capable and had tremendous potential. Everyone in the yard is just devastated.”Barclaycard Premiership football match between Newcastle United and Aston Villa ended up with a fight between two teammates. Newcastle hasn't lost a single game since January 23 and looked as favourites for their April 2 home match against Aston Villa. However things haven't went as planned. On the 5th minute of the game Juan Pablo Angel scored for the away side. Villa continued to dominate and in the second half any hopes of fightback for Newcastle were shattered as Steven Taylor got sent off for the deliberate handball. The foul warranted a penalty and Gareth Barry scored from the spot. Seven minutes later he did it again, after Stephen Carr brought down Darius Vassell inside the box.However, it was not a result that disappointed Toon fans the most. Two Newcastle players, Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer, engaged in a fight in the middle of the pitch at the sight of the crowd. Referee Barry Knight made a decision to send both off. After the match, manager Graeme Souness made no excuse for the behavior of the players; however he defended Dyer, as it was Bowyer who started punching him. Both players could be facing 3-match bans by the English Football Association.Earlier today in Massachusetts, two explosions went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon that left two people confirmed dead according to local police.  A third explosion went off at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library located 8 miles (12.8 kilometres) from the race finish.  No deaths were reported at the site of the library explosion.The explosions went off at approximately 2:30pm Boston local time.   A third explosion at the Boston Marathon site went off at approximately 4:00pm Boston local time, with the Boston police aware of the bomb before it went off.  The Associated Press is reporting that two other devices were found and the police were working to defuse them.Police and paramedics are still on scene of the bombing. Area universities were being evacuated as a precaution.Laurent Fignon, the two time former winner of the Tour de France, has died at the age of 50.  His death was confirmed by his wife, Valerie.  The cause of death was announced as cancer.  Fignon had been battling the disease since 2009.Fignon won the Tour de France in 1983 and 1984 but is also remembered for the 1989 race.

Media photos showed University of Michigan coach John Beilen congratulating Hatch.Hatch survived a plane crash and eight-week coma in 2011, an accident that killed his father and step mother. Hatch had previously survived a separate crash in 2003, that killed his mother, brother and sister. Hatch's father was the pilot in both of those accidents. Hatch, raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, moved in 2013 to his uncle's home in California. He committed verbally to play sports with the university in 2011, and formally signed an agreement in November 2013. Of the tragedies, Hatch told reporters, "Obviously, it's a big part of my life, but I'm about moving forward and making the most of my experience here."The 20th Tour de Taiwan, sponsored by Atunas, organized by Chinese Taipei Cycling Association, will be raced on March 9 to 16 from Kaohsiung City through Pingtung, Changhua, Taiching, Hsinchu, and Taipei County, to Taipei City. What's different from last year is that the cross-division road race will not be arranged.For the joint promotion of Taipei Cycle at Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall and TaiSPO at TWTC Hall 1, the 2008 Tour de Taiwan will successively include elimination races around roads of TWTC Nangang and Taipei City Hall.According to the organizer, 23 teams from 15 countries will participate on this race, and for the promotion of "2008-2009 Visit Taiwan Year" by Tourism Bureau of Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China, ESPN Star Sports and Formosa Television will record on this race, the organizer predicted that spectators from 63 countries will watch this race on television.In one of College Football's oldest rivalries, the University of Michigan Wolverines take back the Little Brown Jug, 28-14 in a game at Minnesota.  This makes it the 14th time in the past 17 years, minus the two years (1999 and 2000) that they did not face each other, that Michigan has won the Trophy and the 64th time they have won it since the creation of the contest.Carlos Delgado was impressive in his National League debut with the Florida Marlins on Tuesday after getting off to a slow start.  In the first inning, the Marlins scored five runs off Atlanta Braves starting pitcher John Smoltz, while Delgado struck out on three pitches.  Delgado made up for this disappointment by following it with four straight hits, hitting four-for-five with three RBIs en route to a 9-0 victory.Before the start of the season, there was some concern about how the change from American to National League would affect the slugger's performance. Delgado spent the past thirteen seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays before signing a four-year, $52 million contract with the Marlins.  Marlins manager Jack McKeon said, wryly, "Many of the writers asked during spring training if his change of leagues was going to be a factor. In the first inning, it was."  Delgado has certainly made an impact on the Marlins organization, and there is a lot of excitement in Miami over his new arrival.  Opening day attendance was a record sell-out at Dolphins Stadium of 57,405, and spirits are high as the Marlins are one of the favourites to win the National League East, thanks in no small part to Delgado's presence.  But, the baseball season is a long road to travel; as Delgado said, "Obviously, we have good talent here. We've got to go out and play. Because we've got such and such, and we picked up this guy, that doesn't mean anything. You've got to go out and do it on the field. Yeah, it was a great game. But it's over now."Today's game was played in front of 57,405 at Dolphins Stadium.The U.S. Open kicked off Day 1 with many epic tennis matches. The USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center was abuzz with tennis fans young and old heading out to see their favorite players play their round one matches.A United States-based operation, known now as USF1, has unveiled plans to join the Formula One motor racing series beginning in the 2010 season. Team principal Ken Anderson and sporting director Peter Windsor officially launched USF1 in a live press conference broadcast on the US television channel Speed.Ken Anderson has previously worked for the Ligier and Onyx Grand Prix Formula One teams, and most recently held the position of technical director for the Haas CNC Racing team in the American NASCAR series. Windsor has previously been general manager at Scuderia Ferrari and team manager for WilliamsF1 before taking up his current role as a journalist and reporter for the Speed channel.USF1 would be based in Charlotte, North Carolina in the United States, unlike all eleven teams that participated in the 2008 Formula One season, which are based in Europe. Anderson also expressed a preference for the team's drivers to be of American nationality. They confirmed that they do not yet have an engine supply contact but expressed a desire to contact all existing Formula One engine builders before signing one.The team expressed an intention to be more open to fans than current Formula One teams in order to appeal to the US market. The possibility for fans to tour the factory and see the car being built as well as television shows showing the inner workings of the team were suggested. Windsor claimed that the team had received the backing of both Max Mosley, the president of Formula One's governing body, and Bernie Ecclestone, president of Formula One's commercial rights holders. No details were given on the team's financial backers, however.Basketball coach John Wooden died at the age of 99 on Friday of natural causes. Born in 1910, Wooden was the first person to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player (1961) and a coach (1973).  Wooden played both college and professional basketball.  He helped lead Purdue to the 1932 National Championship.  After serving in the United States Navy as a lieutenant for three years in World War II, Wooden first coached at Indiana Teacher's College from 1946 to 1948.In 1948 Wooden became the coach at UCLA.  There he immediately turned a failing team into Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) Southern Division Champions.  His 27 seasons with UCLA culminated in 10 NCAA titles in his last 12 seasons, including a record seven in a row from 1967 to 1973.Spurning a lucrative offer to coach the Los Angeles Lakers to remain at UCLA, Wooden stepped down in 1975 following a final NCAA championship winning season.  Following his retirement Wooden embarked in a second career as an motivational speaker and author, becoming known for his "Pyramid of success", a philosophy in which synergistic behaviours reinforce each other to create success in life and basketball.Wooden leaves behind a son James Hugh Wooden, and daughter, Nancy Anne Muehlhausen. His wife Nellie (Nell) Riley pre-deceased him in 1985 after 53 years of marriage.A full crowd showed up at the Guiseppe Meazza in Italy today to watch AC Milan take on Scottish side Celtic.  The first leg of the matches ended in a goalless draw, as both teams were spirited in defense.  Kaka and Inzaghi played as frontmen for AC, while Vennegoor of Hesselink and Jiri Jarosik were the strike pair for Celtic.Milan had the first chance of the game early when Kaka found room and flashed a shot towards the bottom corner, but keeper Artur Boruc got down well to make the stop.  Celtic then had a valid penalty claim after only 6 minutes when Jarosik's volley looked to be blocked by the hand of Maldini, but referee Konrad Plautz waved away the appeals.  Celtic's defense continued to play well, and they limited Milan's chances to long ranged shots.  Lee Naylor then performed defensive heroics for Celtic as he took the ball away from the open Inzaghi, who was waiting to tap the ball in at the back post.  Kaka had two more shots from range at the net, but neither were on target.  Naylor again saved Celtic by clearing the ball off the line from a Kaka attempt.Over an hour had passed when Gord Strachan sent Thomas Graveson on for Celtic in place of Jarosik, and the Dane almost scored right away.  He struck a fine shot at the net, but Massimo Oddo did well to block the attempt.  Milan counter attacked quickly, and Kaka saw his attempt also blocked by a defender.  McManus and Naylor were forced to clear headers off the line from Ambrosini and Inzaghi, both occurring after corners.  Maldini then had a header at the Celtic net, but Boruc was again in the right place to make the stop.  Celtic had another claim for a penalty when Nakamura was brought down in the area, but the Austrian referee again waved away all appeals.  Boruc was again forced into action from a Seedorf free kick, which he was able to deflect out with a hand.  Kaka then shot towards the goal, but the crossbar saved Celtic from going a goal down.  As 90 minutes approached, Celtic had two well positioned free-kicks, but could take advantage of neither, and the game entered extra time.It took Milan little time to go ahead in the extra period, and the scorer would be no other than the Brazilian Kaka.  The youthful striker put on a burst of speed to beat out the tired Celtic defenders and blasted the ball through Borucs legs to give the homeside the lead.  The game continued however, as the Champions League works on full extra time, and Celtic still had 27 minutes to equalize.    It was Milan who pushed however, and Andrea Pirlo twice forced Boruc to make saves.  Then Kaka, in search of a brace, sent a volley over the net after being left alone during a corner kick.  Gravesen's long effort for Celtic was easy pickings for Dida, and Craig Beattie headed a good chance over the bar.  Celtic vainly tried to tie the game, bringing on Kenny Miller, but AC finished the game comfortably, and advanced to the next round of the tournament.Celtic headed into this match knowing a goal would send them into the group stages.Celtic started well when Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink shouldered Shunsuke Nakamura's cross over the bar after ten minutes. If the Dutchman had've been more precise Celtic could've controlled the game from the start. Five minutes later Scott McDonald played a one-two with Vennegoor of Hesselink who played a good short ball back which fell right for McDonald's left foot but he agonisingly hit wide. It wasn't all Celtic though. Spartak Moscow counter-attacked brilliantly and nearly scored 17 minuted in. Artur Boruc made a last-ditch save and Lee Naylor cleared after Vladimir Bystrov cut the ball back to Dmitri Torbinsky just outside the box. Just 60 seconds later Aiden McGeady hit a good shot wide of the Moscow goal. Then 25 minutes in, the referee made the worst decision of the match. Welliton, the Brazilian striker, shot straight at Artur Boruc and the ball bounced off him and hit Gary Caldwell's grounded hand. The referee gave the penalty. There was nowhere for Caldwell to go and the penalty should not have been given. However Pavlyuchenko's penalty hit the post. 2 minutes later Celtic showed no signs of giving up. Scott McDonald scored his first Celtic goal after Massimo Donati's shot deflected off a defender and fell for McDonald on his stronger right foot. He slotted it straight past the keeper to give Celtic a 1-0 lead. 35 minutes into the match, Bystrov, who'd been causing Celtic, mainly Lee Naylor, many problems, sprinted past Lee Naylor again and if it wasn't for captain Stephen McManus blocking the shot, it could've been 1-1. Just before half time Spartak scored from a corner after scrappy Celtic defending. Vennegoor of Hesselink and Mark Wilson couldn't clear the ball and Pavlyuchenko, who missed a penalty earlier, controlled and slotted the ball past a very angry Artur Boruc. In first half stoppage time, Bystrov powered down the left wing and Naylor gave away another corner, luckily though the referee blew his whistle. But that didn't stop Artur Boruc from going over to Lee Naylor and shouting at him. Lee Naylor hit back and if it wasn't for Caldwell and McGeady breaking it up they could've both been sent off.The second half started as lively as the first. Vennegoor of Hesselink was being held in the box in the 51st minute but no penalty was given. The next big chance was when the ball fell for Vennegoor of Hesselink in the 65th minute, he turned and dragged a point-blank shot wide. From the 77th minute onwards the game started to open up with McDonald and Vennegoor of Hesselink having two great chances before Nakamura had three chances in two minutes. In the 84th minute Nakamura had a chance to score a free-kick after Vennegoor of Hesselink was taken down by Martin Stranzl, 21 yards out from goal. Stranzl was then sent off by the referee and Spartak Moscow were left with ten men for the remainder of the match. Unfortunately Nakamura's free-kick hit McDonald as it made it's way toward the goal. Celtic and Spartak both had chances before the full time whistle went.Celtic were very attacking from the start of extra time. The man advantage seemed to be helping Celtic as McDonald and Vennegoor of Hesselink both missed good chances in the first five minutes. In the 99th minute Aiden McGeady made a good run down the right wing to find nobody in the box. Forced to make a shot, it ended it up going off for a throw in. Just before extra time half time Derek Riordan, who replaced McGeady, picked up the ball and slammed a brilliant shot just a yard wide on his European début. Five minutes into the second half of extra time, Maksym Kalynychenko hit a superb shot which Boruc got a vital touch to. The ball then went straight down to the Spartak box but Vennegoor of Hesselink could only hit into Stipe Pletikosa's hands. In the 24th minute, Celtic were gifted a penalty after Scott Brown's power shot struck Radoslav Kováč's arm. Vennegoor smashed the penalty into the bar. Six minutes later the referee blew the whistle. The match was going to penalties.Penalty takersCeltic1) Caldwell2) Nakamura3) Vennegoor of Hesselink4) Riordan5) ZurawskiSpartak Moscow1) Mozart2) Titov3) Pavlyuchenko4) Şoava5) KalynychenkoCaldwell scored his penalty and Mozart equalised. Nakamura smashed his penalty against the bar but Boruc saved Titov's. Vennegoor of Hesselink scored his penalty this time round and so too did Pavlyuchenko. Riordan scored the perfect penalty and Şoava scored his. Zurawski knocked his home and Kalynychenko had his saved by Boruc.Man of the MatchArtur BorucCeltic manager Gordon Strachan says the 5-0 thrashing of Hearts will make no difference to the Champions League second-leg tie against Spartak Moscow."If we were playing a bad side then you could say everything was going for us, but we are facing a right good side," he said about Wednesday's tie. It's good that everybody knows what good players they are and know that the task in front of us is not easy. When I played, I always had a fear of the opposition that kept you going."Strachan says that fear would help Celtic be wary of Spartak and avoid any mistakes after the 1-1 draw in Moscow."If you don't have fear or respect, whatever you want to call it, then you have a problem. There is nothing wrong with a bit of fear now and again."Strachan also stressed that the money that Celtic would earn if they reached the UEFA Champions League Group Stages will not weigh heavily on his players' minds."It is important for us to be in the Champions League. We would like to continue and enjoy the experience. But it's not for us to worry about the financial side of things. Ours is to worry about the game and we have to deal with it. The players don't think about finances or things like that."Monaco was the location for the 2007/08 UEFA Champions League group stage draw. Before the draw took place there was a one minute silence in memory of Antonio Puerta who died earlier this week after collapsing during a La Liga match for Sevilla who then died on Tuesday, August 28.

A full crowd of 36,500 fans showed up at the Phillips Stadion to support their teams.  Liverpool went into the game on a high having beaten Arsenal 4-1 at Anfield on Saturday.  PSV on the other hand have been in a slump as of late in the Eredivise, as they have let Ajax Amsterdam back into the title race.  Peter Crouch, who scored a hat-trick on Saturday, was partnered with Dirk Kuyt for Liverpool, while PSV paired Jefferson Farfan and Diego Tardelli as strikers.PSV were the first to threaten either goal, when Mika Vayrynen blasted a shot over the bar from well out after a one-two with Jefferson Farfan.  John Arne Riise then had Liverpool's first chance as his shot was deflected wide, and the ensuing corner by Steven Gerrard was met by the head of Jamie Carragher, but keeper Heurelho Gomes produced a fine diving stop to keep the scores level.  Carragher then nearly gave the hosts a goal as he deflected a corner barely over the crossbar.  Reds captain Steven Gerrard then scored as he met Steve Finnan's cross strongly with his head, and Gomes could do nothing as Gerrard scored his team record 16th goal in international play.  PSV suffered a blow at the break with striker Jefferson Farfan having to leave the match.  He was replaced by Chinese international Xiang Sun.  A soft clearance attempt by Timmy Simmons then handed the ball to Riise, and the big Dane powered the ball past Gomes, giving the Reds a demanding 2-0 lead.  Liverpool continued to pressure for a third goal, and Riise had another chance when Gomes mishandled a cross, but the keeper was able to recover and save his blushes.  Finnan supplied the ball for the final goal of the match as well, as his cross was met by the head of Peter Crouch.  The 3-0 lead guaranteed the reds the win, but they did suffer a blow on the night when midfielder Fabio Aurelio was forced to leave the pitch with injury.

'There is no back-up plan. We have not had any second thoughts, or other thoughts and we respect our decision to go to Poland and Ukraine. The only thing that will make me decide not to go is if there are no stadiums in the capitals of Warsaw and Kiev. If there are no stadiums, there will be no tournament', he said. Asked if he really is disappointed about the preparations to the championships and the rumoured plans of moving Euro to Italy, he replied he has no information on that subject.  He has also added that UEFA is thinking about moving the championships to August instead of June. The footballers would have relaxed on their summer holidays, there would be less injuries and the level of the game would be higher. 'It is very hard because of the calendar of the European football leagues, the World Cup qualifying, and the calendar of UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup. We would have to come to an agreement with the clubs', he said.He didn't count out the possibility of having 24 teams in the Euros. 'Although the level of these championships is perfect, I think that such teams as England, Denmark, Serbia, Ireland, and Bulgaria could bring in lots to the Euros'. The UEFA has also revealed that the final decision is to be made at an executive meeting in Bordeaux in late September this year.POTSDAM, Germany — After a 3-1 victory in the 2nd game of the UEFA-Women's Cup final 2005 the players of the 1.

PCS members working in the Home Office, which operates the Border Agency, voted for the strike on Wednesday to protest against the loss of jobs at the Home Office, as well as pay and conditions of workers.Following the strike, union workers will also take other action including working to rule and a ban on overtime.Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the strike: "I do not believe it will be right. I do not believe it will be justified." Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, said the behaviour of the PCS was "totally irresponsible". Theresa May, the Home Secretary, described the strike as "shameful" and noted the government will put in contingency arrangements.Mark Serwotka, the head of the union, described the government's reaction as "hysteria" and claimed "there'll be no disruption to the Olympics".The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the largest civil services trade union in the United Kingdom, yesterday reversed its decision to hold a strike for its UK Home Office worker members scheduled for today, the day before the Olympic Games are due to start in London. The strike, which was called last week as a result of job reductions being made, would have affected the UK Border Agency (UKBA), the Identity and Passport Service, and the Criminal Records Bureau, at London Heathrow Airport amongst other UK airports.PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka cited the "significant development" of the creation of 1100 new job positions, 800 in the UKBA and 300 in the Passport Service, as the reason for the union's decision change. "We believe that significant progress means that there is no case for the union to proceed with industrial action tomorrow," Serwotka said yesterday morning. The PCS also reported position recruitment advertisements appearing on the Internet for London Heathrow, London Luton and Gatwick Airport.However, the UK government's Home Office denied that they had created such positions. "We have made no concessions to the PCS and are not creating any new jobs in response to their threat of strike action", a spokesperson for the Home Office stated. Saying the recruitment effort, initiated two months ago, was amongst scheduled modifications to the UK Border Force, the spokesperson clarified: "Unfortunately, due to an administrative error, a figure of 400 posts was repeated in both adverts by mistake. This will now be corrected".Serwotka's announcement was made one hour before lawyers representing the UK government had been due at the High Court to attempt to gain an injunction preventing the strike. According to the PCS, the government's plan was based on accusations that twelve staff members in Brussels and Paris became involved in the dispute despite the fact they would be unaffected. The PCS' decision was welcomed by airport operating company BAA. "So far passengers arriving for the Olympics have had a smooth journey through Heathrow and it is great news that those arriving tomorrow can also expect a warm welcome to London and the Games", a spokeswoman for BAA said yesterday. UK Home Secretary Theresa May had considered the PCS' plans "opportunist and wholly unjustified". Serwotka said he had "[a]bsolutely no regrets" about his previous decision to call the strike.The PCS has also postponed plans to launch a work-to-rule initiative during the 2012 Summer Olympics.The UK operations of Setanta Sports have been placed into administration. Financial firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu confirmed the division would be liquidated.The sports broadcaster, which employs 420 people in Ireland and the UK, entered administration after plans to raise fresh capital through the Russian-American businessman Leonard Blavatnik failed.With effect from today, the company is to cease accepting payments from television customers who had subscribed to its broadcasting services, and 200 employees in the United Kingdom are to be made redundant. Administrators will attempt to find a buyer for the Irish and international arms of the company.The administrators at Deloitte are Neville Kahn, Lee Manning, and Nick Edwards. The specific companies in administration are Setanta Sport Ltd and Setanta Transmissions (UK) Ltd. Setanta Ireland is not under administration.Setanta's UK sports channels, Setanta Sports 1 & 2, have ceased transmission in the UK, but are continuing transmission in Ireland.

Racing UK, which was bundled by satellite and cable television operators with Setanta channels, is not owned by Setanta and will continue transmission.

The rights that Setanta had to broadcast football matches to subscribers are to revert to their rights holders. The rights to broadcast 46 Premier League football matches for the next football season, and 23 matches for the three following seasons, have already reverted, and were sold to United States broadcaster ESPN for £260 million yesterday.Because of UK and European Union monopoly and competition laws, broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting is not permitted to bid for the broadcasting rights that Setanta had.Liverpool F.C., an association football club located in Liverpool, a British city, has been criticized by the city council for attempting to trademark the Liver Bird, a symbol used to represent the city of Liverpool, and its football club.Flo Clucas, the Deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, expressed her concern over the move. "I have some very real concerns over it," she stated. "They do already have their crest trademarked, but they have no right of ownership to claim the bird, or any version of the bird, as their own.""...Not only does it appear on the Royal Charter for the council, but it is also used by local businesses and schools," she continued. "It belongs to the city and nobody has a right to claim it exclusively as the own. It's a symbol for the city."The football club attempted to respond to these concerns by asserting that "Liverpool Football Club is seeking to trademark only its own specific version of the Liver Bird, to combat its use in counterfeit merchandise."However, Clucas stated that although "the club also says they have no intention of charging organisations that want to use it," there is no guarantee that this will still be the case in the future, so, according to Clucas, residents of the city may have to pay for the use of the bird in the future if the trademark is approved.The council is seeking legal advice over the application.Liverpool F.C. formed in 1892, and is currently managed by Rafa Benitez. They have qualified for the Champions League in every one of the last four seasons, and they are currently second place in the English Premier League, and they have won five of their last six matches.The club's home ground is the Anfield stadium, and the main focus of their crest is the Liver Bird.Bolton Wanderers F.C. player Fabrice Muamba has been discharged from the London Chest Hospital, having been taken there in the aftermath of experiencing a cardiac arrest during the first half of a quarter final tie between his team and Tottenham Hotspur on March 17 this year.

A spokesperson for Barts and The London NHS Trust clarified: "[We] can confirm that Fabrice Muamba has now been discharged following several weeks of treatment. All our staff wish him the very best in his ongoing recovery."Muamba thanked the workers at the London Chest Hospital who assisted him in the recovery process. "Their dedication, professionalism and expertise is simply amazing and I will forever be in their debt. I also wish to say thank you to all the many well-wishers who have sent thousands of messages of support," Muamba commented. "Now I am out of hospital, I am looking forward to continuing my recovery and spending precious time with my family," he added. Owen Coyle, the current manager of Bolton Wanderers, described the news as "absolutely fantastic", going on to add that "everyone at the club is delighted" and the treatment provided to Muamba by the London Chest Hospital was "outstanding".24-year-old Muamba was reportedly 'dead' for 78 minutes in the aftermath of his cardiac arrest at the match in White Hart Lane, London as paramedics attempted to restart his heart. Jonathan Tobin, Bolton Wanderers club doctor, explained in March: "It was 48 minutes when he collapsed to reaching hospital and a further 30 minutes after that. He was, in effect, dead at that time. We were fearing the worst and didn't think we would get the recovery we had." Tobin described Muamba's recovery as "incredible". However, Muamba's future in professional football appears uncertain at this stage.According to a report produced by the Culture, Media and Sport select committee of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom on Friday, discrimination against homosexuality is now a worse problem in sports than racism and sports governing bodies have failed to effectively respond to the problem.The wide-ranging report from the select committee was sparked in part by controversy around comments by professional boxer Tyson Fury that the Committee's report described as "violently homophobic". The subsequent inclusion of Fury on a shortlist for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year Award was, according to the report, "symptomatic of homophobia not being taken seriously enough" and "an example of how homophobic abuse is allowed to pass unchallenged too often".The report praised the inclusion of 44 lesbian, gay or bisexual athletes in the team sent by the United Kingdom to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, as well as the visibility of a number of top openly gay athletes including diver Tom Daley and Welsh international rugby player Gareth Thomas, but noted sport still lags behind wider society in acceptance, visibility and respect afforded to lesbian, gay and bisexual people. The authors of the report cited numerous examples of discrimination across different sports including the controversy around Tyson Fury's comments; comments by boxing champion Manny Pacquiao, with subsequent termination of a sponsorship contract Pacquaio had with Nike; verbal abuse faced by British race walker Tom Bosworth; alleged discriminatory comments by Russian Olympic athlete Yelena Isinbayeva; and the "extensive homophobic backlash" faced by the now-retired basketball player John Amaechi when he came out as the first openly gay player in the NBA.Discrimination is responsible, according to the report, for many lesbian, gay and bisexual people dropping out of participation in sporting activity. The report cited a study, "Out on the Fields", which found 30% of gay men surveyed said they had been discouraged from pursuing sport due to experiences from physical education classes in school. The report recommended sports governing bodies "extend their work in schools explicitly to address the problem of homophobia", and warned the exclusion of lesbian, gay and bisexual people has negative effects for both the individuals concerned and for the sports which potentially miss out on talent when players do not feel they are made welcome.The report recommended football clubs need to apply a zero-tolerance policy on anti-homosexual abuse from fans and issue "immediate bans" of one to two years. The report called on corporate sponsors to make it clear to players they won't risk losing sponsorship deals if they come out, citing as a positive change the reform to sponsorship contracts by Adidas. The report also cited the need for visible campaigns against anti-homosexual discrimination in sports to parallel earlier efforts to fight against racism, such as the Kick It Out and Show Racism the Red Card campaigns, and urged sports governing bodies make a sustained commitment to such campaigns.In the United Kingdom, Lancashire Constabulary have charged television and radio presenter Stuart Hall with three counts of indecent assault offences. The charges relate to complaints about alleged events between 1974 and 1984 involving three females between eight and seventeen years of age. Hall has been released on bail and is expected to appear at Preston Magistrates' Court January 7. Lancashire Constabulary described the nature of the allegations as "historic" and said the suspect was being interrogated at a police station today. They arrested Hall at his residence. John Dilworth, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said "there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and ... it is in the public interest to prosecute this case."Hall notably presented UK game show It's a Knockout. He has recently been featuring as an association football commentator on BBC Radio 5 Live, although the corporation said he was not scheduled to present at the station this weekend. Hall was awarded an OBE in the last New Year Honours for services to charity and broadcasting, having had a broadcasting career lasting fifty years.Dilworth stated the following information about the ages of the alleged victims and the dates between which these incidents allegedly occurred:  one aged 16–17, between September 1 and  December 31, 1974; one aged 13, between July 1 and September 27, 1984; and one aged 8–9, between January 1 and December 31, 1983.A student who mocked Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba on Twitter has been sent to prison for his 'racist' comments. Police forces around the UK received complaints about Liam Stacey who made the remarks after Muamba collapsed on the pitch during a match.Stacey, 21, admitted an offence of inciting racial hatred. He was today given a 56-day sentence at Swansea Magistrates' Court. He wept as he was handcuffed and led away. His defence noted he admitted his guilt as soon as police in Swansea arrested him, that he was drunk at the time, and claimed he was not a racist and had friends from ethnic minorities. He had, however, claimed initially his Twitter account had been hacked and tried to delete it when he learned police had been summoned. Former England international player Stan Collymore was among those to contact police.Shortly after Muamba collapsed Stacey posted "LOL, Fuck Muamba. He's dead." When other users responded, he called them "wogs", telling one "go pick some cotton". Some sexual comments were also made. The prosecution had hoped to see the case transferred to a more senior court for a sentence longer than the six-month maximum the magistrates' court could impose.Stacey is suspended from Swansea University in Wales, where he is a biology student. His lawyer had asked for a non-custodial sentence so he could complete the course, saying Stacey was doing well. However, a campaign among other students is calling for him to be expelled from university entirely.Liverpool FC revealed the plans for its new Stanley Park Stadium today. The stadium is to be built over the next three years in Stanley Park, to replace Liverpool's long time home at Anfield.

Their view is if they boycotted the Games, their message of peace would be forgotten in a few hours. While stating the team intends to compete, the Ukrainian team reserved the right to leave the Games immediately should peace not happen, and the Russian military does further intervention in the Ukraine.Sushkevich, who is also a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, denied accusations their comments and decisions have been political in regards to the two hour delay for the team's welcome to the Paralympic village, and actions taken during the welcome ceremony. Rather, he claimed these actions were motivated by a message of peace and human rights.  He claimed the situation for Ukraine is unique.  According to Sushkevich, never before during the Paralympic Games has the host country invaded a participating country.  Suskevich talked about a discussion he had yesterday with Vladimir Putin, the leader of Russia, where Sushkevich talked to Putin as a member of the Paralympic family. He said he asked Putin for peace, for detente at least until the Paralympic Games are over.  The response he received from Putin was that he was heard and Putin would think about what he said.The President said that he views the achievements of the Paralympics above that of the Olympics, that the Paralympics play a vital role in the lives of the athletes.  He said the 31 members of the Ukrainian team want to compete.  There is a problem being the national team of the Ukraine, though, when the country is not whole.  He later said the team has representatives from ten regions of the country, including the western Russian parts.Further comments were made by Ukrainian Paralympic Committee President that in past few years, all of Ukraine's Paralympians who were veterans of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  He hoped in the future, there would be peace and there would be no need to have veterans on the team who had disabilities that were a result of war.Ukrainian biathlon competitor Grygorii Vovchynskyii also spoke during the press conference.  He said Ukrainian Paralympians are part of a big family, and supporters ask them every day how they feel.  According to Vovchynskyii, Ukrainian Paralympians want peace.  They are ready to compete.  They want to show they are a free and independent people who love fair competition. At a press conference immediately following the Ukrainian one, IPC representative Craig Spence said IPC learned of Ukraine's decision to compete at the same time as the media. He said he would prefer Ukraine competes but would understand if they decided to leave. Spence also said all 45 teams and all competing athletes were reminded there could be no alterations to their kits, and no protests.  Everyone is bound by these rules, and the IPC is monitoring social media for athlete compliance.The news was published at today's press meeting.It is the first consequence of the big Spanish doping-scandal. The 32-year old Jan Ullrich won Tour de France in 1997. He was together with Team CSC's Ivan Basso the favorite winner in Tour de France, and the Spaniards Oscar Sevilla was one of Ullrich's most important helpers.All three have to prove their innocence before they can be released, said the German crew who will try to get the two new bikers in the game.Team CSC-owner Bjarne Riis said friday, when he was on his way to meet the other sports executives, and the Tour-management:- "It is sad news. I just heard it. It is of course a shame."Altogether 22 riders are mentioned on the list.The International Cricket Council announced on Friday that controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair has offered to resign from the ICC Elite Umpires Panel with effect from 31st August if he is paid a sum U.S $500,000 to do so. Hair is currently involved in a dispute with the Pakistan side after he penalised them for ball-tampering during their Test  against England at the Oval. The Pakistan team subsequently refused to come out of the pavilion, resulting in their forfeiting the match to the home side. The issue soon snowballed and both the Pakistani captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and Hair came under criticism, the former for bringing the sport into disrepute and the umpire for his alleged bias against players from the Subcontinent.The ICC's chief executive Malcolm Speed told a press conference that copies of Hair's letter had been forwarded to both Doug Cowie (the Council's umpire manager) and the Pakistan Cricket Board. The umpire asks, in his letter, for "a one-off payment to compensate for the loss of future earnings and retainer payments over the next four years, which I believe would have been the best years I have to offer ICC and world umpiring." Speed, however, said that neither he nor David Richardson (the ICC's General Manager)  believed that the episode was motivated by any "dishonest, underhand or malicious intent." on Darrell's part. He also expressed surprise at the contents of the letter and that he felt the issue had been "marked by a series of unfortunate and entirely avoidable overreactions.".Havant and Waterlooville F.C. were today beaten 5 -2 by Liverpool F.C. in their FA Cup 4th round game at Anfield.Havant, who are 122 places and 5 leagues below Liverpool, scored the first goal in 8 minutes, a header by Richard Pacquette.  Liverpool's Leiva Lucas then brought the teams back to one goal each, with a 25 yard attempt going in the top right corner beating goal keeper Kevin Scriven.Havant then replied 6 minutes later, with a attempt by Alfie Potter being deflected into the goal.  However the lead was again only held for a short time, until Yossi Benayoun once again brought the teams level again.  Liverpool then closed out their opposition scoring three more goals to bring the end result to 5 - 2.6,000 Havant and Waterlooville fans travelled the 250 miles to Liverpool and remained in the stadium after the game to applaud their team, most of whom have other jobs. The team were also applauded by Liverpool fans and players, after the game.It is thought that the game has made Havant and Waterlooville around £400,000 in sales and advertising.  However the £350 million deal between Liverpool's American owners highlights the difference between the two clubs.The 2013 Sunshine Coast Rugby Union regular season came to a close yesterday with Maroochydore claiming the minor premiership. Maroochydore defeated Caloundra 40 to 23 at Cotton Tree Oval while second-placed Noosa defeated Fraser Coast 55 to 8 in Urangan.Wikinews was present at Sunshine Coast Stadium where University defeated Nambour 40 points to 10. Both teams were playing for pride as neither could progress to the finals.Nambour opened the scoring kicking a penalty goal, going ahead 3–0. Both teams would score a converted try during the next ten minutes or so. University would score three tries in the last ten minutes of the first half to go to half time leading 33 points to 10. They scored a converted try right on full time in the only score of the second half.A penalty by Christiano Ronaldo midway through the second half kept Manchester United in the FA Cup earlier today at The Riverside.  United, who have their eye on three trophies this year, were forced to scramble back for the draw against Middlesbrough, who have been forced into replays in all three previous rounds, with two going all the way to penalties.  United were the strong favourites for the match, and sent Wayne Rooney and Henrik Larsson up front as strike partners, with Ronaldo supporting from midfield.  'Boro also fielded a strong attacking side, with Yakubu and Mark Viduka leading the way.  United was forced into a keeper change before the match, as Edwin Van Der Sar had a calf injury and was replaced by Tomasz Kuszczak.Middlesbrough had the first of the chances in the game through Stuart Dowing after he received a pass from Julio Arca and was able to run in alone at Kuszczak.  The keeper positioned himself well however, and he deflected Downing's shot out for a corner.  United soon was in control of the game, and their first chance came when Larsson passed in a ball to Rooney, but the young Englishmans shot flashed wide.  Rooney would not miss on his next chance though, as he received a pass from Giggs and slotted the ball past Mark Schwarzer from outside the penalty area.  Kuszczak was then called on again to keep United in the lead when Yakuba did well to turn defender Rio Ferdinand, and released a shot at the net, but Kuszczak dove to make the save.  Manchester's skipper Gary Neville then provided Ryan Giggs with a long cross into the box, but the Welshman's one-time volley clipped off the opposite post and stayed out of the net.  Middlesbrough made United pay for their missed chance before the break, and the 18 year old Lee Cattermole was the goal scorer.  Kuszczak made an error of coming out to catch the ball, and he became mixed up with Ferdinand, who headed clear instead.  The ball went to Arca however, and the Argentine headed the ball to Cattermole, who controlled, spun, and volleyed neatly past the sprawling Polish keeper, tying the match.Middlesbrough would start the second half the same way they ended the first; with a goal.  Cattermole earned a corner off Heinze, and Downing curled the free kick deep, where skipper George Boateng was waiting to head the ball easily past Kuszczak.  The goal was the first for Boateng in all competitions this season.  Being a goal down was a shock to United, who have rarely fallen behind after leading this season, and they soon were on the attack.  Henrik Larsson had the first of the chances, but his shot was blocked by Parnaby.  A flick on by Ferdinand after a Giggs corner hit Boateng's hand, and the hero soon became the villain as referee Rob Styles rewarded a penalty to Manchester United.  Christiano Ronaldo stepped up, and after a studder step slotted the ball past Schwarzer's right side, even though the German keeper went the right way.  The game was tied yet again, and both teams pushed for the win, neither wanting a replay.  Middlesbrough looked the most likely to score for much of the rest of the match as Viduka made space for Parnaby to shoot, but the ball was aimed right at Kuszczak who collected easily.  'Boro then introduced Jason Euell and Lee Dong-gook into the match in  an attempt for the win, but the game ended in stalemate instead.The replay will take place March 19 between the two at Old Trafford, which doesn't give either club much rest after their March 17 Premiership games, when United take on Bolton at home, and 'Boro will host Manchester City at the Riverside.  Manchester also will be playing their European charity match beforehand, which takes place on the 13th.The Vancouver Whitecaps announced the signing of former Toronto FC defender Chris Pozniak. Pozniak was chosen in the expansion draft by the San Jose Earthquakes and was then traded last March to Chivas USA of Major League Soccer. The contract is pending international clearance.Whitecaps president Bob Lenarduzzi said, "Chris brings a wealth of experience and quality to our back end. The signing of Chris made sense for a number of reasons for both the club and Chris. Chris was looking for a team that would be able to use his services for the next six weeks before allowing him to explore opportunities in Europe. We are currently playing through a busy stretch in our schedule and have sustained some recent injuries. This is a win-win for both club and player."In 4 games with Chivas USA this season, Pozniak started 3 and recorded 311 minutes.Pozniak, who was born in Kraków, Poland, and immigrated to Canada with his family in 1990, has been capped by Canada at the U-20, U-23 and senior levels. Pozniak earned his first senior cap in the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup against Haiti. He has since earned 21 caps, which includes a start in Canada’s 1-0 win over Martinique last January.The United States and England opened their 2010 FIFA World Cup campaigns on Saturday with a 1–1 draw in front of a crowd of over 38,000 at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa.England captain Steven Gerrard put the English in front early with his goal in the fourth minute. The goal came as Gerrard was able to slip in behind the U.S. defense in the middle of the penalty box.  The United States equalized in the 40th minute off a long-distance shot by midfielder Clint Dempsey. The shot, from roughly 25 yards from goal, seemed like an easy stop until it bounced off English goalkeeper Robert Green and in for a goal. Both teams had several chances to earn the go-ahead goal in the second half, including a shot by Jozy Altidore that was deflected by Green and bounced off the goal post. A couple of saves by U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard also played a large role in the second half.The draw means both teams earn one point from the match which temporarily placed them in first place in Group C. Both teams play their second game of the World Cup on June 18 when the United States will face Slovenia followed by England playing Algeria.Other 2010 FIFA World Cup action on Saturday saw Korean Republic get off to a strong start defeating Greece 2–0, while Argentina blanked Nigeria 1–0.On Sunday the first round of games in Group C concludes when Algeria and Slovenia face off.

Game Four, played at 12:30 yesterday, was played between the New Zealand Wheel Blacks and the Australian Steelers before a lunchtime crowd. Australia scored six straight goals in second quarter, to lead 29-44 at half time, and eventually came out the winners 41-57. The game featured an unusual duel between two 3.5-point players, Australia's Ryley Batt and New Zealand's Barney Konerferisi.In Game Five, played under lights at 17:30 yesterday, the United States proved too good for New Zealand, winning 36-62. Game Six followed immediately after at 19:30. This game, between Australia and United States attracted a sizable and animated crowd that filled the venue. Australia had only beaten the United States once in the last seven years. The Steelers managed to win gold at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London without having to play them.  Australia opened the game with three straight goals, but the United States caught up, and the score was 14-15 at quarter time, after a last second United States score was counted. While the United States frequently rotated its players, the Steelers had Ryley Batt, Chris Bond, Ryan Scott and Nazim Erdem on the court the whole time. Their strong defence caused timeouts and subsequent turnovers. Low-pointer Ryan Scott became an unlikely hero by prompting two turnovers. Australia won 64-53.Game Seven was the Semi-Final, between Australia and New Zealand, and was played at 12:00 today. The weather was warm and sunny. The New Zealanders performed a Haka, but it did not bring victory. This time Australia rotated its players, and Bond and Batt were on the court together only briefly just before half time, and again in the last four minutes. Australia won handily, 62-45.The Final game was therefore between the United States and Australia under lights at 17:00 on today. The commentators called it "Friday Night Footy". Australia once again played Bond, Batt, Erdem and Scott together, and took off to a three-goal lead, but the United States fought back with good defensive plays, tying the score at 14-all at quarter time. The United States scored three goals straight in the second quarter to take a 29-25 lead at half time. Hopes that Australia could repeat its win of the night before were dashed. The United States team had tight discipline and made few mistakes, in the end, winning 58-54.Medals were presented to the players, coaches and team staff by Greg Hartung, the President of the Australian Paralympic Committee. The players of all three teams voted for the Most Valuable Player of the series, which went to Ryley Batt.This is believed to be the first time that an international wheelchair rugby tournament has been held outdoors.London, England— The United States's Cynthia Paige Simon was quickly pinned in her women's 57kg judo quarter-final match against Spain's Monica Merenciano Herrero at the ExCeL centre in the second day of Paralympics competition.The first match of the competition for both competitors., Simon's previous best had been a third place finish in last year's German Open; Merenciano Herrero's best previous finish was third at last year's Senior World Games.Peaquonnock-based coach Simon is a B3-classified competitor who competes for the Kokushikai club in the United States.

Simon will continue on in the repechage whilst Herrero advances to the semifinals.Former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to prison on Wednesday for 40 to 175 years in Ingham County, Michigan, United States. Nassar pleaded guilty in November to seven charges of sexual assault in Ingham County, however, he is alleged to have victimized over a hundred girls over several years. Nassar is currently serving a 60-year sentence for federal child pornography charges. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, presiding over the Ingham County Circuit Court in Lansing, Michigan, handed down the sentence, stating: "I've just signed your death warrant." Rachael Denhollander first accused Nassar, filing a criminal complaint in 2016. Nassar was charged in Ingham County with seven counts of sexual abuse and pleaded guilty in November of 2017. The true number of victims is alleged to exceed one hundred. During the sentencing hearings in court over 150 women testified Nassar abused them. Alleged victims include famous Olympic gymnasts, such as Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, and Gabby Douglas, although Nassar was not specifically charged with abusing them.Judge Aquilina read out parts of a statement Nassar submitted to the court. In the statement, Nassar wrote, "I was a good doctor, because my treatments worked and those patients that are now speaking out are the same ones that kept coming back over and over". He also criticized an earlier judge for going "ballistic". Aquilina declined to read the entirety, citing concern for the victims; "I don't want them re-victimized by the words in the letter", she said.Nassar served as the team physician for USA Gymnastics for years, spanning four Olympic Games. Simultaneously, he served with Michigan State University. He abused his victims under pretense of treating them as a doctor.Nassar's case has led to allegations of lack of oversight by Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics, and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). At USA Gymnastics, prior to the sentencing three board members resigned over the case on Monday, as well as its president last year. Corporate sponsors of the organization also pulled out.The current president of USA Gymnastics, Kerry Perry, who was appointed in December, released a statement after the sentencing: "During the last seven days, more than 150 courageous women have shared their deeply personal experiences and how Larry Nassar’s despicable crimes impacted their lives. [...] USA Gymnastics applauds Judge Rosemarie Aquilina for handing Nassar the maximum sentence of up to 175 years[...] As stated on my first day on Dec. 1, 2017, I will not waver on my commitment to focus each and every day on our organization’s highest priority — the safety, health and well-being of our athletes."USOC head Scott Blackmun also released a statement in which he apologized: "The purpose of this message is to tell all of Nassar’s victims and survivors, directly, how incredibly sorry we are. We have said it in other contexts, but we have not been direct enough with you. We are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren’t afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams. The Olympic family is among those that have failed you."Both Reuters and the Los Angeles Times noted applause in the courtroom when Nassar was escorted out. Judge Aquilina said, "There has to be a massive investigation as to why there was inaction, why there was silence."University of the Sunshine Coast defeated Caloundra 38 points to 9 yesterday in their round one Sunshine Coast Rugby Union match in Sippy Downs, Australia.Noosa defeated Maroochydore 55 points to 10 in the round's other result.University has defeated Caloundra yesterday in their round 11 Sunshine Coast Rugby Union match at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Sippy Downs, Australia.Caloundra went 3–0 up at the five minute mark after being awarded a penalty due to University playing the ball in the ruck.

Forty-six of the sixty-five sportswriters from across the country agreed Alabama's 35–0 win over Arkansas State on Saturday was the best game in the country, giving Alabama the top spot in the rankings.Once a storied football program under former coach Paul "Bear" Bryant, who led the Crimson Tide to six national championship titles, the team had slipped from its former glory in recent years. With the AP Poll's most recent publication on Sunday morning, the Crimson Tide, only one of four Division I teams undefeated and the only one undefeated in the Southeastern Conference, has taken the top spot for the first time during the regular football season since 1980.The Tuscaloosa News remarked that the win on Saturday was a good gift for coach Nick Saban, who turned 57 on Friday. On Sunday, a brief statement was issued to reporters by Saban, in which he said, "We appreciate the interest shown to our team, but rankings at this time of the season do not define anything relative to the postseason...Our concern is our preparation to play a very good LSU team [Saturday], and these external factors can not affect our planning, schedule or focus on the task at hand."The game next Saturday is crucial to the Crimson Tide, as it will effectively decide who will play in the Southeastern Conference championship game. Louisiana State University (LSU), a powerhouse in past seasons, suffered two losses this season. Alabama hopes to clinch its first conference championship since 1999 and dethrone LSU, the current reigning national champion in college football.Billy Donovan, the head coach of the defending Nation Champion Florida Gators college basketball team, has accepted an offer from the NBA's Orlando Magic to become their eighth head coach.The terms of the deal call for Donovan to receive $27.5 million over five years, or approximately $5.5 million per year guaranteed over the life of the contract.  On May 17, Donovan had received an offer from Florida for a seven-year contract extension, which he never signed.  Although its terms were never officially disclosed, sources say that the salary ranged from $3 million to $3.75 million per year guaranteed.Donovan announced his acceptance of the Magic coaching job at a news conference in Orlando, Florida, at 11:00 a.m. on Friday, June 1.  At another news conference at 4:00 p.m. the same day in Gainesville, he will officially announce his resignation as the head coach of the Florida Gators.Donovan, who won two NCAA titles and three SEC titles in his eleven-year tenure with the Gators, has a career head-coaching record of 296-123: 261-103 with the Gators, and 35-20 in two seasons at the helm with Marshall.In addition to turning down the Gators' contract extension, Donovan earlier was mentioned as a possible candidate with the Kentucky Wildcats, where he was previously an assistant, to replace Tubby Smith as their head coach.  He was also mentioned as a possible candidate for the head coach job at the Memphis Grizzlies, replacing Mike Fratello.The previous head coach of the Magic, Brian Hill, was relieved of his duties on May 23 after barely making the playoffs with a 40-42 season record, and being swept in the first round by the Detroit Pistons.  Hill, who has a record of 267-192 overall with the Magic (191-104 in his first stint, 1993-1997), was 36-46 in the 2005-06 season, his first season back, punctuated by a 16-6 finish that inflated hopes for this past season.  Hill reportedly will be offered another job within the Magic organization.Some experts speculate that the signing of Donovan will boost efforts to build a new arena for the Magic.All times in this Article are North American Eastern Daylight Time - UTC - 4 hThe University of Florida Gators beat the University of Calfornia, Los Angeles Bruins 73-57 in the RCA Dome last night. The win gave the Gators their first NCAA basketball championship. The Gators, a number three seed in the tournament, spent most of the night dominating the Bruins on both offense and defense.Joakim Noah, center for the Gators, recorded 16 points, nine rebounds, and a NCAA tournament championship game record 6 blocks. Noah said, "It's like I'm in a cloud. Not only does this feel good, but it smells good and it tastes good. I can't even describe it."In the previous two games the Bruins allowed only a combined 90 points, but they never seemed to get organized on defense. Florida's early lead stayed throughout the game, with the Bruins unable to re-take the lead.Joakim Noah's father Yannick Noah was a French tennis player (now a singer) who won the Roland Garros tennis tournament. His grandfather was a soccer professional. It's the first time a french basketball player has been part of a winning NCAA basketball championship team. He'll join Tony Parker on the French national basketball team.University of Memphis football player Taylor Bradford died after being the victim of what police are calling a targeted attack.

Penn State is the largest university in Pennsylvania and among the ten largest public universities in the United States.Pennsylvanian James Sheep was charged with driving under the influence on November 22. Cheerleading coach Curt White told the Associated Press that Sheep will return later in 2009. The duration of the suspension was not mentioned.Sheep was pulled over on campus at 3:16 am November 22, before Penn's game versus Michigan State. He registered a .164 blood alcohol level. Penn State won the game 49-18.Sheep has avoided interview requests by The Daily Collegian, Penn State's newspaper, on multiple occasions.In a statement, White commented: "James has been a very enthusiastic and hard-working Nittany Lion, but we are disappointed that his recent actions did not represent the high standards of this position. We are planning to have James resume his duties in the new year and are confident that he will represent Penn State Athletics and the University with a high level of energy, dedication and respect."The Pennsylvania State University website lists Sheep on their website as the Lion from 2007-2008, conflicting with coach White's comment that he would return in the new year.The mascot was introduced in 1907, brought in as a costume character in 1921, and is even the subject of the book The Nittany Lion: An Illustrated Tale. While most American university mascots change in appearance over the decades, the Nittany Lion remains essentially the same design as it has for generations.Some earlier reports suggested that "46 current or former Penn State [football] players have been charged with crimes on 163 counts in the past six seasons." Of those players charged, 27 were found guilty of at least one charge.This season's Sunshine Coast Rugby Union semi finals are now scheduled to take place at Sunshine Beach and Caloundra, Australia.

Ticketmaster is being accused of violating anti-trust laws. According to TicketNews.com, Flash Seats provides an electronic, paperless ticketing system to Cavaliers season ticket holders, and the lawsuit is moving “to stop Ticketmaster’s ongoing campaign to utilize its substantial market power in ticketing service to exclude actual and potential competition.”The Cavs and Flash Seats allege that Ticketmaster is “coercively seeking to enforce its primary-ticketing contracts" (relating to the direct sale of tickets to the public) with the Cavaliers and other customers, by allegedly trying to make the Cavs “use only Ticketmaster’s own secondary-ticketing program (relating to the resale of tickets) or none at all.”Ticketmaster President and CEO Sean Moriarty, in response to the lawsuit filed Monday by the Cleveland Cavaliers and Flash Seats, said the Cavs “breached their contract” with Ticketmaster when the team turned to Flash Seats for the handling of secondary ticket sales.“The Cavaliers' and Flash Seats' lawsuit aims to deflect attention from the fact that the Cavaliers and Ticketmaster fairly negotiated a contract for Ticketmaster to serve as the team’s exclusive primary and secondary ticketing company,” Moriarty said in a prepared statement.Mehmet Okur scored 12 of the last 14 points for the Utah Jazz in the final minutes of their game against the Chicago Bulls on Monday night, propelling the Jazz to a 100-95 win against the Bulls. Okur finished with 20 points and was the high scorer for the Jazz, who now have won three in a row. He played most of the fourth quarter despite picking up a fifth foul early in the final period. In addition to Okur's contribution, Deron Williams contributed 18 points and 13 rebounds in the effort.Kirk Hinrich was the game's leading scorer with 26 points, and Luol Deng contributed 23. However, the Jazz shot 50% from the field and dished out 24 total assists. The Bulls could not match those numbers, only shooting 40% and earning 15 assists. The lack of ball movement was obvious early on, as the Bulls committed three offensive fouls in the second quarter - all as the result of Bulls players attempting to drive the ball rather than pass and try to break the effective zone of the Utah Jazz. Ben Gordon also picked up a flagrant foul early in the second quarter, starting off what would be an ugly twelve minutes for the visiting Bulls. The Bulls were outscored 33-18 in the second quarter, leaving them down 57-43 at the half.It almost wasn't enough of a lead for the Jazz, as the Bulls were able to fight back and cut the lead to three with a three-point shot from Chris Duhon with 1:20 remaining in regulation time. However, the Jazz answered right back with an Okur three-point field goal, and the Bulls could not recover. While the Bulls would answer back with another field goal, the Jazz would score the next four points and pull away with the victory.With the 2014 Winter Paralympics set for March, Wikinews sought comment from U.S. Representative Jackie Speier, who serves California's 14th congressional district about the event and how current U.S. policies impact people with disabilities.   Elected to the U.S. House in 2008, she serves on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Armed Services Committee.  For the first time ever, the Paralympics will be broadcast live in the U.S. on network television.((Wikinews)) : Will "Obamacare" have a positive or negative impact on the lives of people with disabilities?Jackie Speier: By-and-large the Affordable Care Act will have a significant and lasting beneficial impact on persons with disabilities [...] Most importantly, pre-existing conditions will no longer prevent persons with disabilities from obtaining health insurance.  Lifetime limits on medical expenses will be removed and preventive services will be free. All of these provisions of the law create health insurance that is highly supportive of good health outcomes for everyone, but in particular for those who have a disability.((WN)) : Are there any Paralympic athletes or elite athletes with disabilities from your district that people should know more about?Jackie Speier: There are currently two Paralympic athletes who train or live in my district that people will definitely hear more about in the coming years. One is a young woman named Allie Hyatt who trains in Judo with Willy Cahill, [whom] I have also trained with. Allie, who is visually impaired and just 15, has already won numerous awards and will participate in the Youth Olympic Games next year. She is sure to be a force in the Judo world for many, many years. Hyatt lives in San Francisco and Cahill is the founder and CEO of the Blind Judo Foundation. Another great athlete is Mohamend Lahna who is training for the Rio Olympics in 2016 for the paratriathlon," Speier continued. "He is from Morocco originally but lives now in San Mateo and trains daily at the College of San Mateo. He runs marathons with a prosthetic leg and has his sights set on winning several medals atworld and Olympic events in the future. Lahna has proximal femoral focal deficiency (PFFD), a birth defect that affects the hip and pelvis. He is married and has a 1-year-old child.Wikinews also sought comment from other members of Congress, including John K. Delaney, Mike Honda, Kyrsten Sinema, Eric Swalwell, Raúl M. Grijalva and Ann Kirkpatrick but at publication time, had received no response.On Wednesday, the US National Football League (NFL) announced adopting a new policy of fining the clubs if their athletes knelt during the national anthem. Per the policy, athletes who do not wish to stand for the anthem are now permitted to stay in the locker room. Under the new policy, the commissioner can "impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem."According to commissioner Roger Goodell, in their meeting in Atlanta NFL owners reached a unanimous decision. In the statement, Goodell said, "It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic [...] This is not and was never the case." Per the earlier policy, athletes had to be present on the sidelines of the field during the anthem.Since 2016, when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the pre-match national anthem in a protest against racial discrimination, police brutality and shooting of African-Americans by policemen, multiple athletes have joined the protests taking a knee when the US national anthem — The Star-Spangled Banner — was played. Kaepernick then said, "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour".The NFL Players Association said the NFL did not consult them before announcing the policy. The day before the NFL's statement, the clubs agreed to donate 90 million US dollars (USD) to initiatives for social justice.Eric Reid, a former teammate of Kaepernick who also took a knee during the national anthem, said, "I needed to use a platform to speak out for other people who didn't have a voice. So I joined Colin in protesting the issues in this country, which include police brutality, systemic oppression of black and brown people". He added, "This is not about disrespecting the military or the anthem. This is a way for me to bring awareness around these issues in our country."The new policy now allows the clubs to devise their own provisions for fining or suspending the players. New York Jets' chairperson Christopher Johnson said, "There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions. If the team gets fined, that's just something I'll have to bear."Owner of San Francisco 49ers Jed York abstained from voting for the NFL policy in Atlanta.Former US president Barack Obama, in September 2016, said Kaepernick was "exercising his constitutional right".  Current US president Donald Trump, in September 2017, called the athletes who knelt during the national anthem unpatriotic and "disgraceful". Trump also said, "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired.'"Regarding the new policy, Malcolm Jenkins, a defensive back for the Philadelphia Eagles, said, "What NFL owners did today was thwart the players' constitutional rights to express themselves and use our platform to draw attention to social injustices like racial inequality in our country. Everyone loses when voices get stifled." His teammate Chris Long, who donated USD one million to charity last season, wrote on Twitter, "This is fear of a diminished bottom line. It's also a fear of a president turning his base against a corporation. This is not patriotism. Don't get it confused."Retired quarterback Sage Rosenfels tweeted saying, "I hope the NFL decides to completely stop all concession stand sales during the anthem as well. We wouldn't want people buying a $10 beer and an $8 hot dog during our sacred anthem. All TV camera crews must stop filming and direct attention at the flag too. Just seems fair." He later added, "Forced patriotism is the opposite of freedom."About the new policy, Trump told Fox News, "You have to stand, proudly, for the national anthem or you shouldn't be playing. You shouldn't be there. Maybe you shouldn't be in the country".The NFL Player's Association said the union will "review the new 'policy' and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement."US professional pool player Wade Crane has died after a one-car accident in Tennessee, USA.

The cause of death was announced by Cade’s father as apparent heart failure. Cade, whose real name is Lance McNaught was trained by former world champion Shawn Michaels and made his professional debut in 1999. After working in Japan, Cade signed with World Wrestling Entertainment, the largest wrestling promotion in the United States. In 2003 Cade made his first appearance on television and teamed with Mark Jindrak. After one year the team split and Cade was tagged with another wrestler.

It read “World Wrestling Entertainment was informed Friday morning by Lance McNaught’s father that he has passed away of apparent heart failure. WWE extends its deepest condolences to the McNaught family”Tributes were also made by fellow wrestlers. Former Tag Team Champion Matt Hardy and WWE legend Mick Foley paid tributes to Cade.Durham County, North Carolina district attorney  Mike Nifong had his law license revoked Saturday, after a week of hearings by the North Carolina state bar. The hearing came after the state bar charged Nifong with ethics violations, and for breaking several rules of professional conduct, during the alleged 2006 Duke University lacrosse case. Addionally, Nifong was charged with making inappropriate statements to the media, and ignoring evidence in favor of the defendants.Nifong said Friday he would resign, regardless of the outcome of the hearing. He would also not appeal any punishment imposed by the state bar, according to his attorney. Nifong charged three players, Dave Evans, Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty, with rape. North Carolina attorney general Roy Cooper later concluded that the three players were innocent.Nifong was said to have made "multiple, egregious mistakes" as he pursued the charges, but not intentionally, according to his attorney .Nifong said he regretted some of what he said, such as that he wouldn’t allow Durham to become known for “a bunch of lacrosse players from Duke raping a black girl.”Attorneys for the players said they would seek charges for criminal contempt against Nifong."This matter has been a fiasco. There's no doubt about it," said state bar committee chairman F. Lane Williamson.Seattle based soccer club Seattle Sounders FC 2 (S2) lost their initial two away games of the season despite having entered the road trip undefeated with three wins.

The cause of the drowning is unknown.  However, Crippen told his coach that he was feeling ill eight kilometers (km) into the ten km race.The Philadelphian, who comes from a line of prominent swimmers, was participating in the FINA Open Water ten kilometer World Cup in Fujairah, Dubai. When Crippen did not finish the race, swimmers were the first to respond by returning to the water to search for him. Soon after the dive team arrived and found his body just before the last buoy of the two km triangular race course according to race officials.He was taken to the Fujairah Hospital where he was pronounced dead. FINA President Julio Maglione said that Crippen told his coach that he was not feeling well eight km into the race. Speaking from Mexico, where he was attending Olympic meetings, Maglione added, "He continued and he was found in the deep of the water." Maglione disclosed that this was the first death in a FINA event and that they had launched an investigation into the death.The Crippen family is no stranger to the swimming world with Maddy Crippen competing in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Terry Crippen on the US national team and Claire Crippen a former Virginia NCAA All-American. All was under strict rules that exist in our competition. All was absolutely correct. It was an accident, a terrible accident. – Julio MaglioneUnited States swimmer Michael Phelps has been banned from competition and his training stipend revoked for three months by USA Swimming after Phelps was photographed smoking from a glass pipe, often used for smoking cannabis. The picture was published last Sunday by British tabloid News of the World.USA Swimming, which is the governing body of swimming in the United States, however said that no "anti-doping" rules had been violated."This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated, but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people, particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero," it stated. "Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust."The suspension will end in time for Phelps to train for the US Championships, which are to be held on the 7th of July.Phelps has also lost sponsor Kellogg, who said that it would not renew its deal with the swimmer next month.Phelps won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing last year, and has since become one of the world's most famous athletes.Erasing a two-set deficit, the Penn State University Nittany Lions came from behind in dramatic fashion to win the 2009 NCAA Division 1 women's volleyball championship over the University of Texas Longhorns, held Dec. 19 in Tampa, Florida.Down 2-0, Penn State won the next three sets to extend their winning streak to 102 matches and in the process earning their third consecutive volleyball title.Texas' Destinee Hooker led all players with 34 kills, .316 hitting percentage and collected 17 digs.

Topping the list is Steelers linebacker Joey Porter. Porter was considering holding out of training camp for a new deal, and the Steelers needed breathing room to fit under the salary cap. Porter, called the "Most Feared Player in the NFL" by Sports Illustrated last fall, had a disappointing 2006 campaign, with only seven sacks.The New Orleans Saints released Joe Horn by his own request. Horn was a fan favorite, standing up for the city when the team was forced to evacuate following Hurricane Katrina. Horn is also known for infamously pulling a cell phone out of a goal post in a post-touchdown celebration. As expected, the Dallas Cowboys cut quarterback Drew Bledsoe, although Cowboys owner Jerry Jones did not rule out Bledsoe returning at a lower salary, stating: "I spoke with Drew today and told him that this was primarily a cap decision and that the door was very much open for him being a part of our future." Bledsoe, a former first pick in the draft, was pushed out of his job by Tony Romo after a terrible first half in 2006.The San Francisco 49ers released wide receiver Antonio Bryant, after Bryant had several clashes with the law, as well as 49ers head coach Mike Nolan. Bryant lead San Francisco with 40 receptions for 733 yards.

Foley had been shot this past year by a police officer.In an April 25th letter written to Don Fehr (Executive Director of the Players Association) and all major league team owners, Selig wrote, "Steroid users cheat the game." So far this season, four less-than-big-name major league players have been suspended. Under the current policy, each player is forced to sit out 10 games.The ball is now thrown to Fehr, who said over the weekend the union was not ready to discuss it. An answer from the players union will probably be forthcoming some time this week.Congressional hearings on steroids in baseball were held March 17. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), the ranking minority member of the House Government Reform Committee, said, "It's weaker than the policy Congress is considering, but significantly stronger than baseball's current policy."Testifying at the hearings, Fehr said, “My personal view, this is not an institutional view I'm expressing now, my personal view is that our job with violations of substance abuse is not to destroy careers. Our job is to stop it."Selig also wants to add amphetamines list of banned substances in the major leagues.The United States of America have beaten the New Zealand Wheel Blacks to win the 2006 Wheelchair Rugby Championships, the fourth championship ever held.The final score was 34-30 at Christchurch, New Zealand's Westpac Stadium.

This time, however, things turned out differently as USA ever defeated Cuba at the 2006 Americas Olympics Baseball Qualifying Tournament with 8-5.In the top of 2nd inning, with Cuba's starting pitcher Yadel Martí was unsteady. Justin Ruggiano started the offense for USA with a hit. After Norberto González replaced Martí on the mound for Cuba, USA scored after loading the bases and kept the lead through the end of the game.Even though Cuba scored 2 runs with successive hits in the bottom of 5th inning, the American pitchers from the Minor Leagues effectively shut down Cuba's offense. USA eventually ended Cuba's reign as champion with a final score of 6-3. The Americans were crowned the 2007 Baseball World Cup champions, a title they last held way back in 1974. Coincidentially, Cuba did not participate in the BWC in 1974.On Friday, USA Gymnastics (USAG) — the US national governing body for the sport of gymnastics — issued a statement that it will comply with an ultimatum for its entire board to resign.  The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) issued the ultimatum, in the wake of the sentencing on Wednesday of Larry Nassar for sex abuse, that the entire USAG board must resign within six days or face decertification as the gymnastics national governing body.On Wednesday, Larry Nassar was sentenced to prison for 40 to 175 years on seven counts of sexual abuse. He is alleged to have well more than 150 victims, however, with a history of sexual abuse of minors going back more than a decade. Nassar served as the team physician for USA Gymnastics in a career that spanned four Olympic Games. He abused female members of the gymnastics team under pretense of treating them.On Thursday, Scott Blackmun, head for the USOC, sent a letter to the USAG board, listing a set of demands. "[W]hile the USOC encourages USA Gymnastics to think and act broadly on reforming its culture, we also believe that reform must start with an entirely new board", Blackmun wrote. "We do not base these requirements on any knowledge that any individual USAG staff or board members had a role in fostering or obscuring Nassar's actions. Our position comes from a clear sense that USAG culture needs fundamental rebuilding."Although three members of the board had already resigned two days before Nassar's sentencing, Blackmun insisted on a "categorically fresh start at the board level." The letter gives the USAG board until January 31 to resign. By February 28 a new interim board with athlete representation must be seated. Blackmun also outlined a number of additional steps demanded by USOC or face immediate decertification. These include fully cooperating with independent investigations into the Nassar case, ethics training for all staff and board members, and "SafeSport" anti-abuse (i.e. bullying, harassment, hazing) training.On Friday, USAG issued the statement on its website, saying it intends to comply: "USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes. We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, may be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification. USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that may shine light on how abuse of the proportion described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes. USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal — making the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to follow their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment."The USA rugby union team has qualified for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. They defeated Uruguay in succession; in Montevideo 42-13 on September 30, and 33-7 in California on October 7. The USA team originally missed out on qualifying during an earlier round of the Americas qualifing tournament with Canada taking that position.USA went through as 'Americas 4' to Pool A, where they join 2003 champions England, and the 1995 champions, South Africa. The other nation in the pool is Samoa, and one other nation that has yet to qualify, which will be either an Oceania or Asian nation. The USA have been to four World Cups in the past, with their best results being in 1987 and 2003 where they won one fixture in the pool rounds.Next year's World Cup kicks off on September 7, and the USA will play their first game on September 8, against reigning World Champions England in Lens. Uruguay, although having lost the series against the USA, have one more chance at qualification : the series against the winner of (Africa 2 v Europe 4) to qualify as Repechage 1.With the home-crowd Russian fans on the side of the Italians, the United States defeated Italy in sledge hockey by a score of 5–1 today in both teams' opening game at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia.The United States started the first period with possession, but much of this was on their own third of the ice.  Both teams did a full line change within the first minute of play following an Italian penalty by Bruno Balossetti that resulted in a United States power player.  While the USA got possession on the penalty, it was after a few seconds where who had possession was questionable.  The puck then changed possession several times.  Both goalies had to work in the opening minutes of the game. With 12:20 left in the first, Italy had a fast break down the ice.  In defending his goal, the Team USA goalie fell over and there was a mob in front of the goal trying to move the puck.  The USA managed to prevent the Italians from scoring.  Following this, there was a line change and a similar pile up in front of the Team USA net at 12:13.  After a penalty that saw Andy Yohe get 2 minutes for roughing, the United States got possession.Both sides had their fans in arena, with several large Italian flags behind their team's bench.  There were a pair of United States flags.  When the Italians had the puck and looked likely to score, the multitude of Russian flags were waved and the fans cheered in support of the team.  The United States allowed Italy to get possession after two players crashed into each other and had to untangle their sledges.    At 10:20 left, Italy managed to get a shot on goal, which the USA goalie stopped.  With 10:09, both teams were to full strength.  There was another pile up, this time in front of the Italian net, at 9:12 left.  The United States had problems passing during much of this time, and with keeping the puck out of their third.  A United States fan was screaming at the team at one point shouting, "Get it out."  Italy had several good chances but they were not able to capitalize on them.  At 2:30 left, the United States and Italy were about equal with shots on goal: 4 for USA, 5 for Italy.  At 2:30 left in the first,  Valerio Corvino of Italy got 2 minutes in the penalty box for roughing.   With 1:15, good passes by Nikko Landeros and Taylor Chance lead to a goal by Declan Farmer on a power player opportunity.  Immediately following the goal, Italian Werner Winkler got a 2 minute penalty for roughing.  The pace of the game slowed down in the final minutes, and there were fewer hits.  The occasional United States fan chanted "USA, USA, USA."  The first period ended 1–0 in favour of the United States.The second period started with lots of Italian cheering from the stands, while the Americans possessed the puck on the Italian third of the ice.  Both teams were shorthanded, each with a player in the penalty box.  The penalties were over and both teams were at full strength by 14:10 left in the second.  Early in the period, Italy got a two minute penalty for too many players on the ice.  The United States also addressed possession problems they had in the first period and kept the puck in front of the Italian goal.  Team USA still had problems with executing passes though.  Whenever the Italians got possession of the puck and looked like they might have a remote chance of scoring, the Russian fans started cheering loudly.  With 3:48 left in the second, Brody Roybal scored with an assist from Declan Farmer.  With 1:18 left in the second, Guiseppe Condello got a 2 minute penalty for teeing when he rammed the front of his sledge into a USA player's sledge.  The period ended 2–0 in favour of the the United States.During the intermission, a Paralympic presenter went into the audience to talk to Team USA fans in the stands for the screens found on display in the arena.  Following a little patter, she asked the fans to do the Team USA chant, which they did.  In response to the requested, "USA! USA! USA!" chant, a number of people inside the arena booed.The third period started with Team USA possession.  Early in the period, Taylor Chase had a 2 minute penalty for teeing, and both teams were shorthanded with 14:38 left in the third.  Italy was back at full strength by 14:17.  Despite the teeing penalty, the number of collisions appeared down from earlier in the game.  Both teams were at full strength with 12:33 left in the third period.  With 11:56 left in the third, Joshua Sweeney got the puck, moved it down the ice and then slid it past the Italian goalkeeper to score an unassisted goal.  Midway through the third period, and most of the puck possession took place on the Italian third of the ice.  With 4:42 left in the third, with assists from Joshua Pauls and Nikko Landeros, Brody Roybal scored on the Italians to little applause from people in the arena.  The score was 4–0. Following the goal, Team USA took a timeout and made a goalkeeper change, with Steve Cash out and Jen Lee in.  With 3:26 left in the third, Team USA player Paul Schaus earned a 2 minute penalty for roughing.  The Team USA goalie made a fantastic above-the-head glove save with 3:05 left in the third.  With 1:26 left in the game, Italian Florian Planker scored off an assist from Gianluca Cavaliere.  The stadium erupted into loud chanting, and lots of waving of Russian flags. Adam Page was injured with 1:08 left in the game, and left the ice to a round of applause from the fans.  The United States's Paul Schaus scored off an assist from Nikko Landeros with just under 5 seconds left in the game, bringing the final score to 5–1.The United States comes into Sochi as previous Paralympic gold medalists, having won it at all at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, Canada. Steve Cash started for Team USA.  He did not let in a single goal during the 2010 Winter Paralympics.The United States men's ice hockey team upset host country Canada, 5-3, in a preliminary round game on Sunday at the Winter Olympics. It is being called the Americans' biggest Olympic win since the 1980s "Miracle on Ice" victory over the former Soviet Union.The game was only 41 seconds in when Brian Rafalski of Team USA fired a slap shot that deflected off Canadian star Sidney Crosby's stick and bounced past Canadian goalkeeper Martin Brodeur. The Canadians evened the game on a goal nearly nine minutes into the contest on Eric Staal's shot. The capacity crowd roared its approval and the stadium announcer was still giving the details of Staal's goal when Rafalski scored again.Canada evened the game in the second period, but American Chris Drury put Team USA ahead again, 3-2. The Americans took a 4-2 lead on Jamie Langenbrunner's shot with just under 13 minutes left in the game.Crosby cut the U.S. lead to 4-3 with about three minutes left. Canada pulled goalie Brodeur, adding an extra attacker in a desperate attempt to tie the contest. The hosts had clearly outplayed the Americans, with a shot advantage of 45-23. But U.S. goalie Ryan Miller, frustrated the Canadians all night, including their last-ditch attack.Then with just 45 seconds left in the contest, American Ryan Kesler reached around his opponent to slap the final U.S. goal into the empty Canadian net, making it 5-3.The game was just a preliminary round match, but in hockey-mad Canada, where the sport first originated, it was more than that. To lose to the United States in the Olympics on home soil was devastating.  After the game, Canada fans — many in replicas of the team's red and white Maple Leaf jerseys — seemed stunned as they filed out of the Canada Hockey Place. Some Americans chanted "U-S-A, U-S-A!" But many Canadians, including Melissa Mazeman of Winnipeg, Manitoba, were still trying to realize what had happened."As soon as that first goal was scored within in the first minute, that did hurt, it was kind of crushing," she said. "But every U.S. player — or every U.S. fan I have seen on the street — I have said congratulations [to]."Meanwhile, Canadian coach Mike Babcock has replaced Brodeur in the lineup, with Roberto Luongo of the Vancouver Canucks. Babcock said Brodeur's coordination with his defensemen that led to turnovers and four goals out of 22 American shot attempts. He also noted that Brodeur did not make many big saves.Babcock said, "We’re in the winning business. And to win at any level you need momentum-changing saves."Team USA fan David Loring of Colorado Springs, Colorado, one of a vastly outnumbered corps of fans wearing USA Hockey gear, gave goalkeeper Ryan Miller the credit for preserving the win."[Team USA] played really well tonight. I have to tell you, they got outplayed by Canada. We had some really good goalie work this evening.  Brodeur made some nice saves, but Miller really played well tonight. That was the difference I thought."However, not all Americans are happy. The general manager of the U.S. men's team, Brian Burke, feels the team isn't playing at it's best. "I’m not happy with the way we’ve played to this point. We have to play significantly better. We’re playing with about 10 guys carrying us. They don’t hand out any medals for finishing first in the preliminary round," Burke said.He continued saying, "Our center-ice play, we’ve made some glaring turnovers that have resulted in scoring chances. And our overall intensity for 60 minutes — for the first 10 minutes in the second period, I thought we were nonexistent."Chris Drury agreed saying, "I’d still say we would be the underdogs on our lack of experience, certainly now that the tournament takes on a whole new meaning with single elimination. We do need to get a lot better."The win is the United States' first Olympic win over Canada since the 1960 Winter Olympics. It also came one day short of the 30th anniversary of the U.S. hockey win over the former Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics' Miracle on Ice in Lake Placid.  The victory assures the Americans an automatic quarterfinal berth. Canada could still make the round of eight, but must beat Germany in a play-in game Tuesday to reach the quarterfinals.The United States defeated Spain in the semifinal round of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, claiming their first berth in the tournament's final. The United States, ranked #14 in FIFA World Rankings, snapped Spain's 35-match unbeaten streak heading into the game.The loss prevented Spain from setting a new world record of 36 matches without defeat. Spain, the UEFA champion, had set an international record with 15 straight victories and was trying to stretch its unbeaten streak to 36, breaking the mark set by Brazil from December 1993 to January 1996The match was held at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein, South Africa. The FIFA Confederations Cup has been held there as a prelude to next year's 2010 FIFA World Cup.Spain was ranked #1 heading into the match and were deemed heavy favorites. They had won their group games with ease and were expected to do so again against the United States, who barely qualified for the semifinal rounds over Italy. Just days ago, the United States was on the verge of elimination after losing their first two matches of the tournament. The United States had been 1–7–1 against top ranked teams heading into the match and lost its three previous matches against Spain in 1950, 1992, and 2008. The United States qualified for the tournament by winning the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup.A goal by Jozy Altidore (25') gave the United States the lead at halftime and a goal by Clint Dempsey (73') sealed the victory. The team attempted only four shots, two of which were on goal and both scored. Meanwhile, Spain attempted eleven shots with six on goal.The United States will play defending Confederations Cup champion Brazil or host team South Africa on Sunday in the tournament finals.Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt set a new world record in the 200 metres, Thursday evening at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin, Germany.Bolt sped through the 200m in a time of 19.19 seconds, breaking the 19.32 mark set by Michael Johnson of the United States in 1996."I was trying, I was dying," Usain Bolt said after the race. "It wasn't a good race I can say but it was a fast one.""Unbelievable — a ridiculous race. The bend is unbelievable," commented the aforementioned former record-holder Johnson while working for the BBC. "No one has ever run a bend like this and probably never will."At 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall, Bolt is uniquely tall among sprinters to have held record times."I definitely showed people that my world records in Beijing were not a joke," Bolt said on BBC television. "I keep telling you guys my aim is to become a legend. I don't think about records. I don't put myself under pressure. I know what to do and I go and execute ... I did well for myself and I am on my way to becoming a legend so I am just happy."  "We call him 'Insane Bolt,'" commented Wallace Spearmon of the US, the third-place finisher.Last Sunday, with a time a 9.58 seconds, the Jamaican runner set a new world record in the 100 metres, besting his own prior 9.69 second record, which he set at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the race, he beat his main contender, Tyson Gay, who was ahead for 10m until the Bolt reached his full stride.After the 100 metre race, Bolt said, "I was ready. I was feeling good after the semi-finals, feeling good in myself, I felt good. So I knew it was going to be a great race, I just came out here and executed it. It's a great time, I felt I did well. I just feel good to know that I went out there and executed it."Even before his exploits at the World Championships, Usain Bolt was chosen as Laureus World Sports Awards' Sportsman of the Year for 2009.The Jamaican Usain Bolt set a new world record in the final of the 100m sprint, which is often considered a very important event in the Olympic games, with his time of 9.69 seconds.BBC Sport reported that Bolt set the new world record even though "he didn't even try all of the way."Bolt passed through the semi-final with a time of 9.85, only 0.13 seconds behind his own world record time of 9.72.  This is despite the fact that, according to the BBC, Bolt jogged the last twenty metres.The American Tyson Gay failed to qualify for the 100 metre final. "I don't have any excuses. I'm pretty upset," said Gay after realizing he had failed to finish in the top four of the semi-finals, which took place approximately two hours before the final.The world record for the 100 metres has dropped significantly since the record of 10.6 seconds was set by Donald Lippincott on July 6, 1912.The ten second barrier was first crossed by Jim Hines of the United States on June 20, 1968.Triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt of Jamaica will run in a 150 metre street race in Manchester, England on May 17. The race will be conducted as part of the inaugural "Great Manchester 150." Bolt won gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 metres and 4x100 metres relay race in the 2008 Olympic games held in Beijing, China. He set world records in both the 100- and 200-meter races.This will be the first time Bolt will be running in Europe. This will also be the first time he will be running a distance of 150 metres. The race will be held on a specially built tartan track. This event will be followed by Bolt's participation in the August World Athletics Championships 2009 in Berlin, Germany."I am very excited to compete for my first time in Manchester, my first time in a 150 m race and my first time in a street race outside the stadium," Bolt said. "I love competing in the UK, it is like my second home as I usually stay in London during the European racing season. When I heard about the idea I thought it would be great fun and something new and exciting".According to the tournament organizer David Hart, apart from Usain Bolt, top British sprinters and a few other international athletes are also expected to compete in the 150 metre race.92,293 fans watched the University of Southern California Trojans defeat the Penn State Nittany Lions by a score of 38-24 in the 95th annual Rose Bowl Game, which took place Thursday at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena.USC quarterback Mark Sanchez led the Trojans with 413 passing yards, a career high, and 4 passing touchdowns. The Trojan offense surged in the first half, scoring four touchdowns and a field goal to give USC a 31-7 USC lead at halftime. Prior to the game Penn State's defense only allowed an average of 12.7 points per game.Joe Paterno, Penn State's head coach since 1966, watched his team fall behind early from the stadium's press box due to a hip injury suffered in 2006 after a player collided with him during a game. After USC increased their lead to 24 points, television broadcast a shot of Paterno in the press box shaking his head. Paterno commented: "They certainly deserved to win it, but I'm a little disappointed that we weren't a little bit more competitive. And a lot of that was because we made so many mistakes in the first half."The Trojans compiled a record of 12-1 during their 2008 season, the sole loss coming when the Oregon State Beavers defeated the then-top-ranked Trojans on September 25. A win in that game possibly could have earned them a spot in the BCS National Championship Game, which is set to be played next week between the Florida Gators and the Oklahoma Sooners. On the win, Sanchez commented, "We mixed up the run and the pass so they couldn't really key on anything. I think we really maximized our potential. I don't know if it was a matter of opening up the playbook or us just executing very well. Maybe a little bit of both."The Nittany Lions finished the 2008 season 11-2, with the only regular season loss at the hands of the Iowa Hawkeyes. Incidentally, Penn State defeated Oregon State on September 6, 2008.A sell-out crowed showed up at the Estadio Mestalla in Spain to watch Valencia take on Inter Milan in the second leg of the Champions League round of sixteen.  The first match ended 1-1 at the San Siro in Italy, and Inter needed a win or a draw of 2-2 or higher to advance.The first half presented little in the way of goal chances for either team, with the biggest action in the form of a penalty appeal from Inter's Hernan Crespo.  Crespo claimed to have been taken down by Robert Ayala, but referee Wolfgang Stark waved away the appeals.  The only real attacks came in the form of long range shots, with Ibrahimovic taking one for Inter, and Sanchez attempting a blast for Valencia, but neither produced a goal.  Valencias keeper Cañizares then took exception to a foul by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and both players were dealt bookings by the referee.  Another penalty was appealed for by Inter, with Crespo again involved. Inter claimed the Argentine's shot was blocked off the arm of Valencia'a Raul Albiol, but again the referee waved play on.  Valencia was forced into a change when Baraja was injured and replaced him with Hugo Viana.The second half showed slightly more in the way of chances, and Valencia in particular upped the pace.  Inter coped and had their own chance but a header from Dejan Stankovic was hit into the side netting.  Inter again threatened, and could have taken the lead, but Marco Materazzi's header was cleared off the line by Marchena.  Inter pushed now, but Valencia looked the more likely to score in the closing minutes with Marchena and Joaquin both coming close.  It didn't matter however, as Valencia won the series on away goals.The game erupted in violence and several players took swings at each other.  The display was truly disgraceful after the incidents in Italy, and UEFA is sure to envoke punishment once everything has calmed down.The inflatable roof covering BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia was intentionally collapsed in a "controlled deflation" on Friday after a section of the dome was ripped open. As the seven-metre tear became caught in the wind, it began to make loud noises, which one stadium worker described as similar to "elephants running through your living room". The venue was evacuated and no one was reported injured. Windy weather conditions are blamed for the damage. Officials have not yet indicated when roof repairs can be completed to allow the facility to re-open.BC Place Stadium was opened in June 1983 and is scheduled as a key venue for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The roof costs $300,000 per year to maintain.London, England — When Marcel Houssimoli enters London's Olympic Stadium tonight, he will be the only competitor from Vanuatu to represent his country at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.The 2012 Games will be only the third time that Vanuatu has sent a team, with George Kalkaua and Mary Mali Ramel representing the country at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, competing in the javelin, and Tom Tete representing the country at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in powerlifting.The Espiritu Santo based Houssimoli will compete in the men's T37 classification running in the 100m, 200m and 400m events. Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics start on Thursday.Just getting from his home to London required a lot as he flew from Santo to the capital of Port Vila, flew to Brisbane, caught another flight to Singapore before finally getting a plane to London.Venus Williams triumphed over Marion Bartoli of France 6-4, 6-1 yesterday to win the Women's Singles event at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships.For the first time, an American and Frenchwoman were matched up to compete for the British women's singles title. A Wimbledon champion in 2000, 2001 and 2005, Williams was not the favorite to win the title again this year. Currently ranked 23rd in the world, she entered the tournament in the shadow of her sister, Serena Williams.  At the beginning of the tennis season, Serena stated her own determination to reclaim the No. 1 ranking. Serena showed  better than Venus at the French Open by reaching the quarter finals, and won the Australian Open in January (Venus dropped out due to an injury).  In spite of her initial strength, Serena's hopes to dominate the tournament were cut short when she lost to No. 1 seeded Justine Henin in the quarterfinals.Bartoli, the eighteenth seed for this year's championships, had never progressed past the fourth round of any Grand Slam event. However, she progressed to the final by defeating third seed Jelena Janković in the fourth round and Justine Henin in the semifinals in one of the major upsets of Wimbledon history.As Henin lost to Bartoli in the semifinals, Venus Williams was poised to become the lowest seeded player in recorded history to win the Wimbledon singles title. With powerhouse serves and an aggressive ground strokes battle, she did just that. Williams comfortably knocked out Bartoli in two straight sets, with match point accidentally striking Bartoli in the wrist.  Venus was reunited with the Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court during the trophy ceremony. Another first, the All England Club is paying men's and women's singles champions equal prize money. Venus was paid $1.407 million, to which she replied "Thank you, All England Club - we're playing under equal terms."The men's final takes place later today with first seed and defending champion Roger Federer taking on second seed Rafael Nadal in a repeat of last year's final.Under the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu-Dhabi's floodlights, German driver Sebastian Vettel added a new Formula One record to his list as youngest winner of the championship at 23 years. On Saturday, Vettel took the title at the final race of this year's competition. Starting from pole position, the Red Bull Racing driver led the race right through except during pit stops, when reigning world champion Jenson Button led for a few laps.Championship leader Fernando Alonso started the race 11 points ahead of Mark Webber. With 25 points for a win, 18 for second and 15 for third, the Spaniard only needed to finish second to secure his third world championship. With a 15-point lag behind Alonso, Sebastian Vettel was third in the championship standings; winning the championship depended on neither Alonso nor Webber finishing on the podium.A major accident between Michael Schumacher and Vintantonio Liuzzi on the first lap of the race triggered deployment of the safety car. Alonso and Webber were among drivers who decided to make earlier than planned pit stops while racing was resricted. However, they rejoined the track behind the Renault of Vitaly Petrov, who proved extremely difficult to overtake. Both remained stuck behind Petrov for the remainder of the race, finishing 7th and 8th respectively to score 6 and 4 points.Sebastian Vettel went on to win the race ahead of the two McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, scoring 25 championship points to give a total of 256 - only 4 ahead of Alonso.Vettel had never previously led this year's contest. He had to wait until championship favorites Alonso and Webber crossed the finish line in 7th and 8th positions respectively before receiving the news by team radio. With his voice breaking among tears and laughter, Vettel thanked his team for their efforts throughout the season. He won five races from ten pole positions.Since the start of his F1 career, Vettel’s name has repeatedly entered record books.In 2007, he replaced an injured Robert Kubica in the United States Grand Prix. Finishing 8th and collecting one championship point; this his first record was youngest driver to score a point in F1.In 2008, Vettel had the opportunity to race for a full season with Toro Rosso, winning what remains that team's only race victory. At the Italian Grand Prix, he became the youngest driver to qualify in pole position and youngest race winner. In 2009, he moved to Red Bull Racing, scoring that team’s first pole position and first race victory. He went on to finish second in the world championship.Red Bull drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber took the top two podium places in the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in São Paulo on Sunday. This secures victory for their two-car Red Bull team in the 2010 Constructors' Cup, with one race left. However, the Drivers' Championship is yet to be decided. The Abu Dhabi GP will be the decider in a season of close competition.Surprisingly, Nico Hülkenberg started the race in pole position. But Hülkenberg couldn't delay Vettel beyond the first corner, his Williams being passed later in the opening lap by Webber and Fernando Alonso's Ferrari. Hülkenberg finished 8th, the first car to finish a lap behind the winner.Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) started 4th, but was overtaken by Alonso after an error. He and teammate Jenson Button saw the chequered flag 4th and 5th.Mercedes GP drivers Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher finished 6th and 7th, on the same lap as winner Vettel.A high-speed accident involving Force India's Vitantonio Liuzzi triggered a safety car twenty laps from the end, preventing overtaking for several laps and mixing up both lapped and leading cars.Alonso, who grabbed the remaining podium place, still leads the Drivers' Championship with 246 points. Both Webber and Vettel closed the gap to 8 and 15 points respectively.Bart Cummings wins his 12th Melbourne Cup with Viewed ridden by Blake Shin.  Bauer, ridden by C W Brown, was second after the photo finish, with C’est La Guerre ridden by B Prebble coming third. Honolulu was the last placed horse.Cummings began training in 1953. His first Cup win was with Light Fingers in 1965. This win is his 250th group one win.   Today's 148th Melbourne Cup field of 24 was reduced after the scratchings of Yellowstone and Zarita, withdrawn by its trainer Pat Hyland on Monday due to a respiratory infection. The English horse Yellowstone was scratched later in the day by a veterinarian after failing to recover from a hip injury sustained last week.The race began with Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien's 3 horses Septimus (an early race favourite and $7 chance), Honolulu, and Alessandro Volta setting a cracking pace for a large part of the race before fading badly at the turn into the straight to occupy 3 of the last 5 places. From there Viewed stormed clear before Bauer pulled it back in the last 50 yards to go down by a nose, in one of the closest finishes to a Melbourne Cup in the race's history.The race was watch by an estimated 105,000 at Flemington Racecourse with many more across the country stopping to watch the race on television.A representative of Chile's Under 20 team was subdued by taser after their match against Argentina in Toronto. The problem started as the Chile delegation entered the team bus.Nathan Denette, a CP photographer, was quoted, "All of a sudden we looked over and there was a big brawl that breaks out, between four or five people. Next thing you know, the bus just unloads and there's eight, 10 players come off the bus and there's just fists flying everywhere, between the cops, the security guards, a couple of ladies were involved that were security. It looked like a big dogfight. People throwing fists and cops with their billyclubs out and then all of a sudden it got out of control and a police officer grabbed his taser gun and tasered someone - I don't know if he was a player or if he was part of the team - as soon as that happened, it got even worse. We heard this big bang...it was just commotion after commotion after commotion. Some of the players were trying to get players back on the bus. But some were furious they were trying to get back off the bus. And then they opened up the windows on the bus and were throwing things at the officers. And then all of sudden, they were trying to grab them from the inside of the bus. And it just escalated."Police handcuffed some of the Chilean players. Many players were bleeding and screaming as they were escorted back to the dressing room.FIFA officials were at the game. However, Toronto police took control of the situation.This came after a very bad tempered 3-0 loss to continental rival Argentina where the referee and his assistants had to run to the tunnel after the game.On Sunday, Manchester United announced the loan of their Spanish goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to Belgian club Standard Liège for the rest of the season.Last year, Valdés signed an 18-month contract with the English club, but the three-time UEFA Champions League winner was given very little opportunity at Old Trafford. He made only two appearances for The Reds last season, after David de Gea was injured. Relations between Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal and Valdés were not good. Van Gaal did not pick him for the pre-season tour to the United States, saying Valdés was unwilling to play a game with the under-21 team.This season, Valdés was not allowed in the locker room, and van Gaal prevented him from training with the main squad and the under-21 team. The official team photograph omitted him.Valdés was a member of Spain's squad for the World Cup in 2010 and for Euro 2012, collecting a winner's medal both times. Per Manchester United's statement, "Manchester United and Standard Liege have reached agreement for the temporary transfer of goalkeeper Victor Valdes, effective until the end of the current season. The deal is subject to formalities being completed."On Instagram, he posted a photo that read "Thank you all for your support during these months of hard work for me, i will never forget! See you soon!"Dwayne Wade had 36 points to lead the Miami Heat to a 98-74 victory Thursday night over the Dallas Mavericks.

The £27 million Manchester United star had a scan on Wednesday that showed the 4th metatarsal he broke on Apr 29 had healed - in less than 6 weeks.Rooney was supposedly spotted boarding a plane to Germany while the BBC claim sources close to the Football Association indicated Rooney was in England's final World Cup squad.The news is considered a big boost to England's chances to win the World Cup. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had said the player's chances of playing were "a forlorn hope." The English soccer club, recently bought by American billionaire Malcolm Glazer, was concerned the investment would risk a worse injury if the previous toe-bone break had not healed when he started to play again. Manchester United's club doctor Todd Gill and physiotherapist Rob Swire, accompanied by a small army of Red Devils' lawyers, were said to have attended the foot scan.The scan was considered so important to England's fortunes that Eriksson sent England's doctor to observe the event. A FIFA official was also present in the crowd at the moment of truth for Rooney's foot. The official would have been final decision-maker in case of a dispute between one of the richest soccer clubs in the world and the country that invented the game.The Swedish manager of the English football team Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had said Rooney would play some part in the competition, named Rooney in England's 23-man squad for Germany. The World Cup tournament pits soccer players from national teams  against each other for a trophy. Previously graced by Pele and Maradona, England has not won the competition for 40 years.Strong road victories for the Columbus Crew and the Chicago Fire strengthened their positions at the top of the stacked Eastern Conference, while in the Western Conference defending champions Houston Dynamo became the final team to record a win.24-year-old Dutchman Pieter Weening takes out the eighth stage of the Tour de France to Gérardmer by millimetres over German Andreas Klöden.

The Puskás Award is given to the football player voted by the public to have scored the best goal of the year.Lira's goal was a bicycle kick, in a 2–1 victory for Goianésia on March 11; he has since moved to Vila Nova. His goal won 46.7% of the vote, with about 1.6 million people voting. He won the award ahead of five-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, whose solo goal against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final won 33.3% of the vote. Alessandro Florenzi, who plays for AS Roma, scored a 50m long-range goal against FC Barcelona in a UEFA Champions League group stage match and came third with 7.1% of the vote.When Lira's name was announced he broke into tears. He said "It honestly feels like a dream." Only 297 spectators were present in the stadium, Lira said, when he scored the goal in a regional championship of the second division. He added "I could never have guessed that it would change my life so much".This was his first time in Europe. As a player of a second division football club, he said "I've been struggling to get my head around meeting so many stars, let alone being up for [the] award with Messi and then having my goal beat his in the vote." Lira also thanked "my family and all those who voted for me."Messi praised the goal. "The fact is it's a great goal and he deserved it. The award is in good hands".On Sunday, Filipino-US chess grandmaster Wesley So won this year's Tata Steel Chess Tournament, held in Wijk aan Zee, Netherlands, securing 9.0 points out of thirteen. Following closely in second place was current World Champion Magnus Carlsen with 8.0 points. Wesley So won five games and drew the remaining eight. A player gets a point for each win, half a point for a draw and no points for a loss. He is currently on a 56 lossless game streak. In the final round, Wesley So was paired against Russian grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi. Wesley So captured a central pawn which was expected to be recaptured to equalise material but wasn't. Soon, his opponent unexpectedly castled offering a pawn sacrifice which was accepted. Despite being ahead in material his opponent threatened to capture his queen. However, he was able to defend using his extra central pawn and prevent counter-play forcing the Russian to resign. He won last year's Grand Chess Tour by winning the Sinquefield Cup and London Chess Classic and coming second in the Leuven Grand Chess Tour.Magnus Carlsen won four, tied eight and lost a game against Richárd Rapport. In the last round he faced his rival and contender for the World Chess Championship of the last year, Russian Sergey Karjakin. In the game, Karjakin provoked Carlsen to sacrifice his knight on which grandmaster Fabiano Caruana tweeted, "Karjakin must be in a very charitable mood". He quickly sacrificed his knight pinning Karjakin's knight to his queen. Despite being a piece down he gained an advantageous position. Karjakin defended his position extremely well, as grandmaster Alejandro Ramírez said, "He can commit the most despicable errors and then show world-class toughness from the next second!". The defence worked and a draw was agreed upon. Also known as the "Wimbledon of Chess", the Tata Steel Chess tournament attracts top chess players every year. The tournament has two professional groups, Masters and Challengers, and an amateur group. It is organised in a round-robin format where each player plays a game against all other players. The tournament is scheduled to run its 80th edition next year in Wijk aan Zee, Netherlands.The West Gippsland Latrobe Football League (WGLFL) Semi Finals were played this weekend at the Moe and Sale Recreation Reserves.Moe lost to Traralgon in the major Semi Final in Sale after beating Maffra in the Qualifying Final.

West Ham were 10 points adrift of relegation safety at kickoff, and desperately needed points to secure a stay in the Premiership for next season.  Tottenham on the other hand have been enjoying a good run of play as of late, and had a chance to jump above Portsmouth into 8th position in the Premiership.West Ham started strongly in the match, desperately trying to bring the game to Tottenham with the support of their home fans urging them on.  West Ham's first effort came in the second minute, but keeper Paul Robinson was able to beat away the shot of Mark Noble.  Things took a downturn for the Hammers several minutes later, when Matthew Upson was forced off the pitch after aggravating a calf injury, and was replaced by Calum Davenport.  Dimitar Berbatov then had two great chances for Tottenham, as he went one on one with keeper Robert Green, but Green was able to stop the Bulgarians attempts both times.  West Ham continued to press, and were rewarded with a goal on 16 minutes.  Paul Konchesky's pass was chested down by Argentinian Carlos Tevez, and Mark Noble half-volleyed the ball into the back of the net.  Tottenham nearly got an equilizer only minutes later after a defensive error by West Ham, but Berbatov's shot was again saved by Green.  More chances came for both sides in the forms of Defoe for Tottenham and Harewood for West Ham, but the next goal would come through the young Carlos Tevez.  Michael Dawson fouled the Argintinian on the outside of the 18 yard box, and Tevez curved the ensuing free kick in under the crossbar.  The goal was Teves' first since joining West Ham at the beginning of the season.  He was booked for his goal celebration as he ripped off his shirt and ran into a group of cheering fans.Tottenham made a change to start the second half, substituting Tom Huddlestone for Hossam Ghaly, and Huddlestones prescence helped Tottenham to control the midfield.  They used their control to its potential, and Aaron Lennon was able to earn a penalty after being brought down by Lee Bowyer in the area.  Jermain Defoe stepped up and slotted the ball past Green to cut the Hammers lead in half.  Spurs continued to press for an equilizer, and got it in the 63 minute as Lennon flicked a Berbatov cross into the path of Tainio, and the Finnish international volleyed the ball past Green.  The tying goal seemed to wake West Ham up, and Bobby Zamora and Keppa Blanco were added to the mix to try and save the 3 points for the home side.  West Ham got their goal, and Tevez was involved again as his cross was headed home by substitute Zamora.  As 90 minutes approached, Tottenham won a free kick on the edge of the box, and Dimitar Berbatov stepped up to the plate.  Several of Berbatov's attempts had been blocked by keeper Green already, but he would not be denied this time as he curled the ball into the top left corner, leaving the goalie helpless.  Tevez again threatened Tottenhams goal, but his shot flew just wide.  West Ham would be left to rue their missed chances when Defoe's shot was parried by Green, but the ball was tapped in by Canadian Paul Stalteri, giving the visitors their first lead of the game, and soon earning them all 3 points.  The goal came just over 5 minutes into stoppage time, and there was no chance left for West Ham to equilize.West Ham will continue their battle to stay in the Premiership in two weeks time against Blackburn, while Tottenham is due for an UEFA cup battle against Braga.England have beaten West Indies by 79 runs in the first One-Day International of the West Indies tour of England at Lord's, London, England, giving Paul Collingwood victory in his first match as England's one-day captain.England started their innings slowly, scoring just 26 runs off the first 10 overs.

West Indies win the three match series 2-1.England's bowlers fared poorly, despite removing Devon Smith early on, with the West Indies batsmen scoring 116 runs off the last ten overs. Runako Morton (82 not out), Chris Gayle (82) and Dwayne Bravo (42 off 24 balls) helped the West Indies to an imposing total of 289-5. The only wickets for England were taken by Liam Plunkett (3-59) and James Anderson (2-51).In response, England's batting performance was no better than their fielding. Although Owais Shah scored 51, England lost too many batsmen cheaply including Kevin Pietersen for 0. They were reduced to 196 all out, far short of the 290 runs needed. Fidel Edwards took 3-30 and Daren Powell took 4-40 for the West Indies.Previously on the tour, England won a four match Test series 3-0 and drew a two match Twenty20 series 1-1.Toss: West Indies won, and chose to bat first.Did not bat: D Ramdin, DBL Powell, R Rampaul, FH EdwardsFall of wickets: 1-16 (DS Smith, 2.3 ov), 2-93 (Chanderpaul, 20.1 ov), 3-108 (Samuels, 22.4 ov), 4-193 (Gayle, 41.6 ov), 5-285 (Bravo, 49.5 ov)Fall of wickets: 1-6 (Prior, 2.2 ov), 2-29 (Cook, 8.3 ov), 3-33 (Pietersen, 8.5 ov), 4-72 (Bell, 17.6 ov), 5-144 (Shah, 30.4 ov), 6-162 (Collingwood, 33.5 ov), 7-162 (Mascarenhas, 34.1 ov), 8-168 (Plunkett, 36.3 ov), 9-171 (Broad, 37.5 ov), 10-196 (Panesar, 44.2 ov)England: A N Cook, M J Prior (wkt), I R Bell, K P Pietersen, P D Collingwood (capt), O A Shah, A D Mascarenhas, L E Plunkett, S C J Broad, MS Panesar, J M AndersonWest Indies: C H Gayle (capt), D S Smith, S Chanderpaul, M N Samuels, D J Bravo, D Ramdin (wkt), D R Smith, R S Morton, F H Edwards, R Rampaul, D B L PowellPlayer of the match: D B L Powell (West Indies)Player of the series: S Chanderpaul (West Indies)Umpires: M R Benson and B G Jerling (South Africa)TV Umpire: P J HartleyMatch referee: M J Procter (South Africa)Reserve Umpire: I J GouldWest Indies have beaten England by 15 runs in the first Twenty20 international of their tour of England at The Oval, London, England.The West Indian innings started off badly by losing Gayle early, however they turned their fortunes around with some attacking and aggressive cricket and posted a huge total of 208. A bigger total could have been posted if it had not been for a late innings batting collapse. England started their reply by getting off to a flyer, but lost some early wickets that slowed down the run-rate. Leading the charge was Paul Collingwood with a fast 79 with 5 4's and 4 6's. In the end, England fell short by 15 runs. Had they not have lost the early wickets, England would have probably won the match to take a 1-0 lead in the series. Instead, it is West Indies that have taken a 1-0 lead in the series.Toss: West Indies won, and chose to bat first.Did not bat: DBL PowellFall of wickets: 1-13 (Gayle, 1.4 ov), 2-97 (Chanderpaul, 10.1 ov), 3-115 (DS Smith, 12.1 ov), 4-131 (Bravo, 13.2 ov), 5-190 (Ramdin, 17.3 ov), 6-199 (Samuels, 18.2 ov), 7-204 (DR Smith, 18.6 ov), 8-206 (Sammy, 19.3 ov)Did not bat: RJ Sidebottom, JM AndersonFall of wickets: 1-40 (Cook, 4.2 ov), 2-48 (Prior, 4.6 ov), 3-69 (Trott, 7.5 ov), 4-78 (Pietersen, 9.1 ov), 5-90 (Shah, 10.5 ov), 6-101 (Mascarenhas, 12.2 ov), 7-192 (Collingwood, 19.5 ov)England: A N Cook, M J Prior(wkt), I J L  , K P Pietersen, P D Collingwood(capt), O A Shah, A D Mascarenhas , M H Yardy, S C J Broad, R J Sidebottom, J M AndersonWest Indies: C H Gayle(capt), D S Smith, S Chanderpaul , M N Samuels, D J Bravo, D Ramdin(wkt), D R Smith, R S Morton, D J G Sammy, Ravi Rampaul, D B L Powell Result: West Indies won by 15 runsTwenty20 Debutants:AN Cook, AD Mascarenhas, MJ Prior, OA Shah, RJ Sidebottom and IJL Trott (England); DBL Powell, R Rampaul, DJG Sammy, MN Samuels and DS Smith (West Indies)Player of the match: P D CollingwoodUmpires: P J Hartley and N J LlongTV umpire: I J GouldMatch referee: M J Procter (South Africa)Reserve umpire: RT RobinsonWest Indies have beaten South Africa by 6 wickets in the second semifinal of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur to reach in final of the tournament.South African cricket captain Graeme Smith won the toss and decided to bat first.

The Be Active Western Stars won the Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League championship 40–43 in a low-scoring game on Sunday night against the Sachs Goudcamp Bears characterised by relentless defence by both sides. The Stars fought their way back from being nine points down at three quarter time to take the lead with only minutes to go, thanks to a spectacular shot by Georgia Inglis. The match saw Amber Merritt and Kylie Gauci engage in a protracted duel. At one point Merritt suffered a bone-crunching sideways fall that the crowd feared meant she had injured her shoulder, but Merritt got back up again.Gauci was fouled out in the last minutes, and Merritt used her free throws to put the Stars three points up. Japanese import Mari Amimoto attempted to tie the game with a three pointer, but missed. Merritt has suffered injury this season. She showed Wikinews a long scar along the right forearm. Surgeons had corrected where she had torn the muscle away from the bone.The Bears won their place in the final by beating Victoria in the Qualifying Final on Friday night 40–62. The Stars had to defeat the Sydney Uni Flames 66–34 on Friday night and then Victoria 32–48 on Saturday night to earn their place in the final. Victoria defeated the Sydney Uni Flames 59–42 to claim the bronze medals. After the games there were the presentations.  The Western Stars' Clare Nott was named 1 point player MVP, Kylie Gauci was 2 point player MVP, Sarah Stewart from the Sydney Uni Flames was 3 point player MVP and Merritt was 4 point player MVP. These four players, along with Cobi Crispin from Victoria form the All Star Five for 2013. Victoria's Ellie Cole, who won four gold medals in swimming at the London Paralympics, was named Best New Talent. Nonetheless, Cole told Wikinews that she was not giving up swimming to become a basketball player. Despite her injury, Merritt was the league's high scorer for the season. Mari Amimoto was named the MVP of the finals series, but Gauci was season MVP. Liesl Tesch made a special presentation to Lisa Edmonds, a pioneer of the women's game who has been playing wheelchair basketball for 24 years. Lisa was part of the original Australian Women's basketball team back in 1989, and played in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Paralympics. This was the last season to be administered by Disabilty Sports Australia. Starting next season, the league will be administered by Basketball AustraliaThe 2005-2006 Ontario Hockey League season kicked off to a start Wednesday night at Wendler arena in The Dow Event Center in Saginaw, Michigan, USA with the Saginaw Spirit hosting the Plymouth Whalers, with over 4,600 people attending.  The Whalers won 7 - 2.A power shot by a player sent the game into a 5-minute delay when a piece of glass on the boards was shattered during the first period.  The game opened its first period with 4 goals for the Whalers, with right wing player Dan Collins scoring two.  Teammates James Neal and John Vigilante picked up the remainder.  The Spirit also received a goal, made by defenseman Patrick McNeill.The second period started with an early goal by Michal Birner for the Spirit.  Plymouth later rebounded with two goals from players Ryan McGinnis and Dan Collins.  Later on in the period, Plymouth member Jared Boll was penalized with a ten minute misconduct.  He did not return to play for the remainder of the game.The third period held a goal made by Plymouth's Mike Letizia, rounding out the final score to 7 - 2.  Later on in the period, Plymouth's #2 defenseman Brett Bellemore suffered an injury that left him on the ice.  He later was able to skate to the bench, where he was examined by the team trainer, Dennis MacDonald.The Benet Academy varsity boys basketball team defeated the Wheaton Academy Warriors 64–55 in a non-conference game Tuesday night, handing the host West Chicago, Illinois, United States school its first loss to a team from Illinois and second loss overall this season. The gym was filled to standing-room-only capacity and Warriors fans donned white t-shirts specifically made for this event, saying "BEAT BENET" and claiming "There is only one Academy." Sixteen Wheaton Academy fans wore their school uniforms during the game. Such a show of support ultimately did not lead the Warriors to victory, however, even with 6-foot, 9-inch The College of William & Mary-recruit Tim Rusthoven on their side. Rusthoven was the focus of Benet's defensive strategy. As the Redwings point guard Dave Sobolewski said, "We knew that we wouldn't be able to take him out of the game with just a single guy. We had to take him out with our entire team, and we did a great job doing that."Wheaton Academy had a 19–15 lead at the end of the first quarter. Benet would never trail again for the rest of the game, however, with Sobolewski scoring ten points in the second quarter to give the Redwings a 37–32 lead at halftime. Benet eventually led by a huge margin of 56–41 with four minutes and 31 seconds left in the game. The Warriors managed to narrow that lead to 58–53 with 44.2 seconds left, but the Redwings successfully made eight of 12 free throws in the final one minute and five seconds.Wheaton Academy coach Paul Ferguson commented, "They were very physical. They killed us on offensive rebounds...Benet played a real good game, they shot ball well and rebounded well." Rusthoven had 21 points and seven rebounds, while Sobolewski also had 21 points but only five rebounds.The Warriors, now with a record of 20–2, had won seven straight games before this one. "We knew it was a big game from their standpoint. They were 20–1 and hadn't won by less than 12 points. We came in and took care of business," said Sobolewski. Benet, with a record of 18–3, now has an eight-game winning streak as well. The Redwings, still undefeated in conference, are now in contention for their first East Suburban Catholic Conference championship since the 1994–1995 season. Eddie Burns of the Naperville Sun attributes Benet's success to its defensive strategy, which he says is "making life miserable for the opposition". As of February 5, the Redwings had let their opponents score an average of 41 points. As forward Mike Runger said, "I think everyone on this team really values defense. Players on this team know that defense is what can get wins."Wheelchair curling continued today at the Ice Cube Curling Center at the 2014 Winter Paralympics on difficult playing conditions as a result of the warm temperature outside.  In the morning session, the South Korea lost to Russia in the eighth end by a score of 5–7, the United States lost to Canada 2–7 in seven ends, Norway edged out Finland 6–8 in extra ends, and China defeated Sweden 8–4 in seven ends.

Tied after eight ends, they went to extra ends which Norway won with 2 points.Outpacing other curlers on the ice, United States looked like they might be able to come back to tie things after their second end against Canada, and then only being down one after the fourth end, but Canada went on to score points in the next three ends.While Sweden won three of the seven ends they played against China, they were unable to beat the Chinese team who scored 2 points in two ends and 3 points in another end.  In the fourth end, the 3 points came after a precision takeout by the Chinese skip Wang Haitao that cleared two Swedish stones off the sheet.With the crowd behind them the entire match, Russia came from behind after the first end and third end to tie things up in the fifth end and take the lead.  They allowed the South Koreans to score two points in the seventh end to force an eighth end.  Russian skip Andrei Smirnov cleared a South Korean stone sitting in front of three Russian stones off the sheet that gave the Russians a two point lead.The United States has not medaled at the past two Paraympic Games, with their best finish a fourth at the 2010 Games. Of the United States's curling team, two are returning wheelchair curling Paralympic veterans.  James Joseph, the second, competed at the 2006 Winter Paralympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics.  The skip and Madison, Wisconsin native, Patrick McDonald, competed at the 2010 Games.  Penny Greely, the lead, competed in sitting volleyball at the 2004 Summer Paralympics where she won a bronze medal. David Palmer, the third, is competing at his first games after having a fourth place finish at the 2013 World Championships in Russia and a fifth place finish at the 2012 World Championships in South Korea.  Alternate and Cape Cod native Meghan Lino is also at her first Paralympic Games after taking up the sport in 2009.Sweden's team has three team members who competed at the 2010 Games in Vancouver, Canada: Jalle Jungnell, Glenn Ikonen, and Patrik Kallin. 60 year old Jungnell has the team's most Paralympic experience, having competed at the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Summer Paralympics in wheelchair basketball, as well as competing at the 2006 and 2010 Winter Paralympics in wheelchair curling.  Finnish born Ikonen had been suspended for six months following the Vancouver Games following a positive doping test. He claimed metroprolol was a drug he had been using for 4 or 5 years, and was unhappy that his doctor prescribed the blood pressure reducing drug because he would not have intentionally taken a banned substance.  The 2014 Games are the first Paralympics for Russia's wheelchair curling team.  Alternate Oksana Slesarenko from Yekaterinburg and skip Andrei Smirnov also from Yekaterinburg have the most experience on the team, both having taken up the sport in 2003, and competing at the 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2013 World Championships.Team Canada includes all five members of their 2013 World Championship winning team, including 63-year-old skip Jim Armstrong, 51-year-old Dennis John Thiessen, 52-year-old Ina Forrest, 47-year-old Sonja Gaudet, and 37-year-old Mark Ideson.  Gaudet is the only wheelchair curling Paralympian with two gold medals, having won them in 2006 and 2010.  Teammates Armstrong and Thiessen were part of the 2010 gold medal winning team. Gaudet also has gold medals from the 2009, 2011, and 2013 World Championships.  While Armstrong was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1990 for his accomplishments in able bodied curling, Gaudet was the first wheelchair-only curler to be inducted when she was part of the 2013 class.South Korea has two returning 2010 Games silver medalists, Kang Mi-Suk and Kim Myung-Jin.  Both originally played other sports before taking up curling.  Kang played table tennis and Kim played wheelchair basketball.On Saturday, Russia beat China 5–4, South Korea lost to Norway 0–10, Canada beat Great Britain 6–3, and Slovakia defeated the United States 6–4 in the morning session.

Another curler often sits behind the stone thrower to hold their chair in place while they execute their throw. Unlike a number of other Paralympic sports, there is only one classification in wheelchair curling and a variety of lower body disabilities compete in the sport.  South Koreans Kim Myung-Jin and Kim Jong-Pan, Swede Kristina Ulander, Team USA's Meghan Lino, Patrick McDonald, and David Palmer, and Russians Alexander Shevchenko, Svetlana Pakhomova, Oksana Slesarenko, Andrei Smirnov, and Marat Romanov have spinal cord injuries.  Canadian Jim Armstrong has injured knees.  Canadian Ina Forrest lost her leg in a farming accident. Team USA's James Joseph has a limb deficiency.London, England — Wheelchair rugby got underway yesterday at London's Basketball Arena with four games being played: the United States versus Great Britain, Sweden versus Belgium, Australia versus Canada, and Japan versus France.Before a full house at a game that was the first one to sell out in the lead up to the start of the London Paralympics, the United States national wheelchair rugby team defeated Great Britain national wheelchair rugby team by a score of 56–44.  While the game got off to a slow start for the United States, once the team found its rhythm, they dominated the home team and appeared to score at will.  Despite this, the crowd supported their side, even when they were down by eight points.  When the United States bench started a chant of U-S-A! U-S-A!, the crowd soon drowned them out with a chant of Team G-B! Team G-B!The United States came to London as defending gold medalists and ranked first in the world.  Coming into the game, the team's assistant coach James Mate told the media regarding this game, "To be truthful we have played the home team a couple of times, but you have to play the game in that moment and it can give the hosts the edge. [...] In Beijing, Great Britain gave us our best game, and the semifinal was a three-goal game. We had something similar in June (at the Canada Cup). [...] They (Great Britain) play some like us and some like Canada, and are one of the teams that have a lot of good players, so we can't focus on just one player, but on the team as a whole."Ranked sixth in the world, Great Britain came to London as the home town favorites.  Their roster included club players from across the country including David Anthony who plays for the Cardiff Pirates, Andy Barrow, Bulbul Hussain and Steve Brown who play for the Kent Crusaders, Jonathan Coggan and Mandip Sehmi who play for the Stoke Mandeville Storm, Mike Kerr who plays for the North West Bulls, Myles Pearson who plays for the West Coast Crash, and the team's only female player Kylie Grimes who plays for the London Wheelchair Rugby Club with teammate Ross Morrison.Before the game, first time Paralympian Great Britain wheelchair rugby player Mike Kerr told the media regarding his squad selection, "I felt I'd never been given a chance to get noticed, so I got myself some court time at big tournaments like Knock and Roll in 2010 (a USA national tournament) and Bernd Best (the biggest wheelchair rugby tournament in the world, held in Germany). I played well and I think people finally took notice."  Regarding the wait to play, Kerr said, "It's hard. I hate waiting around. I'm here to do a job and the sooner I get started the better. But it's been a great experience so far. The crowd and support have been amazing. [...] I'm really confident. We took confidence from how we played against them at the Canada Cup (in June). If we play our game we can shock them."The United States meets Japan while Great Britain meets France later today in their second games in pool play.In the second wheelchair rugby match of the London Paralympics, Sweden defeated Belgium by a score of 52–42. Sweden, the current European champions, came to London with a relatively new coach, who only took over the side in late 2011. Belgium's coach Bob Vanacker also plays on the team.  He and Peter Genyn and Lars Mertens play their club wheelchair rugby in the United States.In the first game for both teams since the London Paralympics began, Australia national wheelchair rugby team defeated Canada by a score of 64–52.  Australia and Canada both had their flag bearers from the opening ceremonies represented by this sport, Greg Smith for Australia and Garett Hickling for Canada.Beijing silver medalists Australia came to London ranked second in the world.

Japan came to London having beaten the top ranked United States in this year's Canada Cup.Cathedral Square, Sydney, Australia —Wikinews attended the Wheelchair Rugby Tri-Nations Series in Cathedral Square, Sydney, ongoing from Wednesday. This is the first time an international wheelchair rugby event has been held outdoors, and in this arena. Three nations are competing: the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.The venue is Cathedral Square, Sydney, which is adjacent to Hyde Park. The Sydney Central Business district is on the other side of the park. An outdoor stadium has been constructed specifically for the tournament, which is believed to be the first time an international wheelchair rugby tournament has been held outdoors. This choice was validated by the fine and warm weather. Free sunscreen was given to the crowd.The Opening Ceremony was officiated by Australian Paralympic Committee Chief Executive Officer Jason Hellwig. In attendance were the Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, the Deputy Lord Mayor of Sydney, Robyn Kemmis, and Paralympic swimmer Matthew Cowdrey. A large crowd, mostly consisting of school groups, was entertained by boy band Justice Crew singing their hit Best Night. Each team is to play the others two twice, on Wednesday September 18 and Thursday September 19. Finals are to be held on Friday. All three teams are highly ranked internationally. The United States team is ranked number one in the world. It won bronze at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, gold at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, and bronze at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, and is the current world champion. This is its first visit to Australia since the 2000 Summer Paralympics. The Australian team, known as the Steelers, is ranked second in the world. It  won silver in Beijing and gold in London. The team is almost unchanged from the one that won in London. Greg Smith has become the assistant coach.The first game, held immediately after the Opening Ceremony, was between the United States and Australia. The United States proved the better team, forcing errors and turnovers. Three turnovers in the first quarter were especially costly for the Steelers, who lost 56–43.The second game was held at 17:30 under lights. The crowd was small, but there were a number of New Zealand fans in the crowd, including a few Maori. Two of the New Zealand players are also Maori. The well-disciplined United States team proved too good for the Wheel Blacks as well, who lost 58–40 in an entertaining contest.The third game was at 19:30, between Australia and New Zealand. The Australians led the whole game, which was nonetheless entertaining to the last. In the dying seconds of the game, Australia's Ryley Batt shunted a stalling New Zealand player across the line to force him to score, then threw the ball to team mate Chris Bond, who raced for the line at high speed but was beaten by the buzzer. Australia won 61–48.The New Zealand team, known as the Wheel Blacks, is ranked tenth in the world. It won gold in Athens.Highlights of the tournament are scheduled to be shown on Foxtel Sports  in Australia on September 28 and 29.The wife of English football player Wayne Rooney has given birth to a baby boy in Liverpool, England.Coleen Rooney gave birth to the child in the Liverpool Women's Hospital at 1420 GMT, after being nine days overdue. The child has been named Kai Wayne Rooney. The father was present at the birth. The birth itself was natural, however Coleen did have to be induced.A spokesperson for the married couple has said: "Mother and baby are both absolutely fine. Wayne and Coleen are thrilled with the wonderful addition to their family life." Wayne Rooney is a striker player for Manchester United F.C. He had to abandon earlier training sessions due to the birth taking place.Wikinews witnessed three rugby union matches at Sunshine Coast Stadium in Queensland, Australia this past Saturday. Upon arrival, a woman's sevens match was in progress between the Sunshine Coast Stingrays and Toowoomba Army. Sunshine Coast won this contest 26 to 15, an 11 point margin.The local A-Grade contest between University and Caloundra started almost immediately after the completion of the woman's game. Caloundra went ahead after 12 minutes with a converted try. They would lead by 26 points early in the second half before University gained the momentum.University put on 21 points to 6 in the final half an hour. The final result — Caloundra 32 defeated University 21.In other local A-Grade games, Maroochydore thrashed Nambour to the tune of seventy points, 75 points to 5; and Caboolture easily accounted for Fraser Coast 46 points to 6. Noosa had the week off.The Sunshine Coast Stingrays lost there last Premier Rugby home game for a month against Sunnybank 36 points to 6. Sunnybank lead 17 points to 3 in the dying moments of the first half, but conceded a penalty which resulted in the hosts scoring what would ultimately be their final points of the game.The visitors would capitalise on Sunshine Coast mistakes. They won lineouts against the throw and counter rucked in a more efficient manner than Sunshine Coast. Sunnybank scored 19 unanswered points in the second half. The final score in a lop side contest — Sunnybank Dragons 36 defeated Sunshine Coast Stingrays 6.File:Paralympics 2014 stamp 30 RUB.jpgOn Thursday, with 110 days until the start of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, Wikinews interviewed Assistant Professor in Educational Leadership, Sport Studies and Educational/Counseling Psychology at Washington State University Simon Ličen about attitudes in United States towards the Paralympics.Licen has recently joined the Sport Management Program at Washington State University to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents.   Originally from Slovenia, he served as the Director of Media and Communications of a WTA Tour event and was a member of the UNESCO Slovenian National Commission.  He was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian wheelchair basketball national team.((Wikinews)) : Why do you think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and even Canada?Simon Ličen: Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society.  It emphasizes consumerism, the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities, dedication and qualifications, and reinforces, rather than changes, existing ideas related to gender, ethnicity and nationality.  Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled.  Although disability is not contagious, interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it.  Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication, hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to.Other countries, including the ones you mention, have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society.  Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act, many social institutions including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity.((WN)) :  What do you think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time?Simon Ličen: The impact depends on a number of aspects.  One of them is the channels that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on.  Will they be shown nationally or regionally, on NBC or on any of the company’s multiple cable networks?  A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown.  Remember that there is a nine-hour difference between Sochi and New York, and a 12-hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast.  So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night, and evening prime-time events will be shown — indeed live — in the morning U.S. time.  So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous than it appears.  A third important factor is the way the event will be mediated: will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics?  Will they treat and announce the competitions as they do all others — for better and worse?  Will they take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity?  All in all, I think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects; but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations.((WN)) : What role should the media be playing in promoting the Paralympic Games? Why does the US media provide so little coverage of the Paralympics compared to other sports?Simon Ličen: I don’t think the media should be promoting any sports event.  I think the role of the media is to inform about the event and to cover it fairly.  It is not just the Paralympic Games, or disable sports in general that yield very little media coverage; a recent study has shown that women's sports only account for 1.3%–1.6% of televised news media.  The situation improves considerably during the Olympic Games and prime-time Olympic coverage comes close to equal coverage of both men's and women's sport.  Outside of that, however, U.S. media coverage is largely limited to the men's four major leagues, college football and college basketball.   Again, the media decide which sports to cover based on their perceived entertainment value and its potential of generating sponsor revenues.  The Paralympic Games are complex to understand and its participants hard to identify with because there are less instances of dominating performances and long-standing rivalries, which are concepts that are understandable even to the casual fan.((WN)) :  What role does the fact that the Paralympics are about people with disability competing at sport play in the American public's reception of the Paralympics?Simon Ličen: I would speculate that the American public is largely indifferent to the event as it is currently represented in the media.  The majority of people are oblivious of the Paralympic Games.  They might greet an American medal winner as this would reaffirm the success, supremacy and tenacity of an American representative in a global field.  In more general terms, however, the American public chooses to largely overlook disabled sports as the average able-bodied person likely does not want to be represented by, and thus identify with, a disabled person.((WN)) : Is the fact the US Olympic Committee is the national Paralympic Committee a hinderance or help in the development of the Paralympic movement in the US?Simon Ličen: In general terms, this is both an opportunity and a risk: it can activate its sizable financial, promotional and media influence to bring attention to the Paralympic movement, but at the same time might choose to push disabled sports to the side in order to accommodate influential sponsors.  I am not familiar with the specific work done by the US Olympic Committee in terms of supporting, popularizing and expanding the Paralympic movement so I cannot speculate which way the actual work done by the USOC sways.((WN)) : What conditions need to exist in the US for Paralympic athletes to get sponsorship similar to their Olympic counterparts?Simon Ličen: Sport sponsorships are indeed strongly influenced by the media prominence of competing individuals.  Individual disabled athletes have already been able to secure profitable sponsorship and endorsement contracts; perhaps the most notable example is Oscar Pistorius who was in this sense a true groundbreaker before falling off the pedestal due to his pending trial.  This is even more true when one considers that not all Olympic athletes are able to secure profitable or even exaggerated contacts: an Olympic archery champion is less appealing than an Olympic champion javelin thrower, a female javelin thrower is less appealing than a male sprinter, and a Jamaican champion sprinter is less appealing than an American elite basketball player.  Sporadic media appearances, such as those during the Paralympic fortnight, will hardly suffice to land disabled athletes major contracts; an athlete has to be in the constant media and popular spotlights to secure lucrative contracts.  Until Paralympic athletes [...] [are] able to achieve that kind of media presence, high sponsorships are likely to elude them.((WN)) : Many countries provide federal money to support their Olympic and Paralympic athletes.  Should the US consider this as a way of increasing visibility for the Paralympics, supporting increased opportunities for people with disabilities and increasing the US Paralympic medal count?Simon Ličen:  Focusing on the US medal count will successfully keep the Paralympic Games away from mainstream attention!  A focus on the medal count as a means to establish supremacy is typical for American professional sports, and the Paralympics will never be able to beat the Olympic Games or the major leagues at their game.  This is why the Paralympic Games should involve a different narrative.Countries typically allocate governmental support to the more vulnerable groups in society because those who are strong can protect their interests through their vast financial and social means.  In this sense, the United States should support participation in the Paralympic Games to promote adaptive sports in general and thus increase sports participation among people with disabilities.  People with disabilities are among those who most benefit from participating in sports and physical activity due to their health and social advantage; however, they also have much fewer opportunities for sport participation and often require expensive adapted sports equipment.  Public funds should contribute to their sport activity in general, and federal funding of Paralympic athletes could certainly provide an excellent example for local communities.  Unfortunately, I fear that even the most progressive congresswomen and congressmen will be [reluctant] to increase that funding given the current federal budgetary situation.Yesterday, Wikinews interviewed Steve Redhead, a Professor of Sports Media and Acting Head of School of Human Movement Studies at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia, about the Australian women's national soccer team (Matildas), the Australian men's national soccer team (Socceroos) and the current differences between the state of women and men's soccer in Australia.  The Socceroos are currently getting international attention following yesterday's 2014 FIFA World Cup draw which placed the 59th FIFA ranked team in the same group as top FIFA ranked Spain, fifteenth ranked Chile and the ninth ranked Netherlands.The Matildas were in the news late last month, following their AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2014 draw which saw them placed in the group with Japan, Vietnam and Jordan.  With the competition scheduled to take place in May, the Matildas are looking to repeat their performance as AFC champions.  Domestically, Australia's top women's club team Sydney FC finish third in the International Women’s Club Championship held in Japan this past week after defeating South American club champions Colo-Colo in a penalty shootout.((Wikinews)) : The Socceroos are ranked 59th by FIFA.  The Matildas are ranked 8th by FIFA in the latest rankings. Should media coverage correlate to team performance and international rankings? Is there an element of tall poppy syndrome in the coverage of the Socceroos?  What other factors can be used to explain the relative differences in media attention other than performance?Steve Redhead: Women's sports performances are seen as less than men's — deep structural sexism (globally replicated).((WN)) : What's the difference in style of play between the men and women's national teams?Steve Redhead: If we take soccer teams, with the newish rules on tackling from behind globally soccer has become almost a non-contact sport — this has helped the women's game enormously and the styles of play don't differ very much at all. If you were from  outer space watching games, you would not know that a game was being played by men or women at the top level. The big remaining difference is goalkeeping. Men's team goalkeepers are invariably way over six feet at the top level. Goalkeeping in the women's game looks different because of this difference.((WN)) :  Why are the Matildas more successful in international competitions and ranking wise than the Socceroos?SR: Socceroos have been in decline since Hiddink stopped being coach. Aging team, no great young players coming through to replace the golden generation. No such problem with Matildas — just steady improvement, and good coaching.((WN)) :  Soccer is one of most popular spectator sports for women.  Why do you think the W-League has been unable to capitalize on the female audience like netball has?SR: This is a difficult question — I just think it is going to take time, and articles like this one — it has been the same problem all over the world for women's football and increasing the audience is always difficult.((WN)) :   Why do you think men don't watch the Matildas in the same numbers as they watch the Socceroos?SR: The soccer culture for men's football is long standing, there is a real history for the culture. Not so in the women's game.((WN)) :  Do problems with A-League finances translate into broader problems for the W-League and its ability to attract investors?SR: Yes, I think so. But there is a deep structural sexism in the culture too.((WN)) :  None of the Socceroos received DAS [Direct Athlete Support] grants from the Australian Sports Commission in the past year while almost every single player on the Matildas received DAS or SLGSfW [Sports Leadership Grants and Scholarships for Women] funding. What accounts for difference in Australian Sports Commission/Australian Institute of Sport funding and what would it take to change that?SR: Can't really answer that one.((WN)) :  What role should the government play in encouraging media organizations, both newspapers and television networks, to cover women's soccer in Australia?SR: I think it does take federal government intervention — educational programmes in sport long term, enforcement of equality legislation, etc.((WN)) :   Does the media feed into traditional Australian gender stereotypes by not covering elite women's sports?SR: Yes it does. Media sports education is crucial. We do this here at Charles Sturt University in NSW and I did it at University of Brighton in the UK.((WN)) :  Australia has a long history of a male-driven sporting narrative. How does this narrative play into current representations of men and women in Australian soccer?  Does the cultural heritage of male-driven narratives make one national team more inherently authentic than the other?SR: No, but I think it does make it difficult for women's sport to build the narratives over a period of time.((WN)) :   Do issues with the Matildas not receiving the same level of media recognition as the Socceroos play a role in the development and attention of other Australian national soccer teams like blind football at the Paralympic level, cerebral palsy football at the Paralympic level, Australian teams at the International Gay Games, deaf soccer teams at the Deaflympics, wheelchair soccer at the World Cup of Powerchair Football?SR: Yes, it is about equality — there is so much discrimination in the coverage of sports teams.London, England— Tuesday, following her team's 62–37 win over Mexico in the quarter-finals at the North Greewich Arena, Wikinews interviewed Amber Merrit of the Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team.In their next match, the Gliders will face the victors from the United States versus Canada, having suffered their first loss of this year's Games to Canada on Sunday night by seven points.Vail, Colorado, United States — Yesterday, Wikinews sat down with Australian blind Paralympic skier Melissa Perrine who was participating in a national team training camp in Vail, Colorado.((Wikinews))  This is Melissa Perrine. And are you like Jess Gallagher and just here training and not competing?Melissa Perrine: I'm not competing right now.((WN))  And you competed in 2010 in Vancouver?MP: I did.  Yeah.((WN))  And who was your guide?MP: Andy Bor.((WN))  Why a male guide? He's got to have different skis, and he can't turn exactly the same way. MP: I think that with me it was just that Andy was the fittest person that was with the team when I came along. He used to be an assistant coach with the team before I started with him.((WN))  And you guys have a good relationship?MP: Yeah!((WN))  Like a husband and wife relationship without the sex?MP: No, not at all. (laughs) Older brother maybe. Good relationship though. We get along really well.((WN))   So have you ever lost communications on the course in an embarrassing moment?MP: We ski courses without communications. (unintelligible)((WN))   You're a B3 then?MP: I'm a B2.((WN))   So you can see even less than Jessica Gallagher. MP: Yes.((WN))   How do you ski down a course when you can't even see it?MP: Andy!((WN))   You just said you had no communications!MP: Oh, I just have to be a lot closer to him.((WN))   So if he's close enough you can overcome that issue?MP: Yeah.((WN))   Why are you doing skiing?MP: Why?  I enjoy it.((WN))   You enjoy going fast?MP: I love going fast. I like the challenge of it.((WN))   Even though you can't see how fast you're going.MP: Oh yes. It's really good. It's enjoyable. It's a challenge. I love the sport, I love the atmosphere.((WN))   I've asked the standing skiers, who's the craziest Paralympic skiers? Is it the ones who are on the sit skis, the blind ones or the ones missing limbs?MP: I probably think it's the sit skiers who are a bit nuts. I think we all think the other categories are a bit mental. I wouldn't jump on a sit ski and go down the course. Or put the blindfold on and do the same thing.((WN))   B1 with the black goggles. Is your eye sight degenerative? MP: No, I'm pretty stable.((WN))  Not going to become a B1 any time soon?MP: Oh God, I hope not. No, I'm pretty stable so I don't envision getting much blinder than I am now unless something goes wrong.((WN))  And you're trying for Sochi?MP: Definitely.((WN))  And you think your chances are really good?MP: I think I've got a decent chance. I just have to keep training like I have been.((WN))  Win a medal this time?MP: I'd like to. That's the intention. (laughs)((WN))  Do you like the media attention you've gotten? Do you wish there was more for yourself and winter sports, or of women athletes in general?MP: I think that promoting women in sport and the winter games is more important than promoting myself. I'm quite happy to stay in the background, but if I can do something to promote the sport, or promote women in the sport, especially because we've got such a small amount of women competing in skiing, especially in blind skiing. I think that's more important overall.((WN))  Most skiers are men?MP: There's more men competing in skiing, far more. The standards are a bit higher with the males than with the females.((WN))  The classification system for everyone else is functional ability, and you guys are a medical classification. Do you think you get a fair shake in terms of classification? Are you happy with the classification? MP: I think I'm happy with it, the way it's set out. With vision impairment I'm a B2, against other B2s. It may be the same category, but we have different disabilities, so there's not much more they can do. I think it's as fair as they possibly can.((WN))  You like the point system? You're okay with it? Competing against B1s and B3s even though you're a B2?MP: The factors even all that out. The way they've got it at the moment, I don't have any issues with them, the blind categories.((WN))  What was it that got you skiing in the first place?MP: An accident, basically. Complete by chance. A friend of mine in the Department of Recreation used to run skiing camps in the South West Sydney region, and she had a spare spot at one of the camps. Knew that I was vision impaired, and: "Do you want to come along?" "Yeah, why, not, give it a go." This was back when I was about twelve, thirteen. I went, and I loved it. Went back again, and again, and again.  And for the first five or six years I just skied for like a week a season sort of thing, like, you're on a camp. Fell in love with the sport; my skiing and the mountain atmosphere, I love it, and then, when I finished my HSC, I decided to take myself off to Canada, and skiing Kimberley, the disabled race program that was run by the ex-Australian who coaches Steve Boba, and I'd heard about it through Disabled Winter Sports Australia. And I thought I'd spend some time in Canada, which is for skiing, and had a year off between school and uni, so... first time I ran through a race course actually. It was pretty awesome. So I went back again the next year, and Steve [Boba] recommended me to Steve [Graham], and he watched me skiing in September in the South Island, and invited me on a camp with the Australian team, and I trained for Vancouver, and I qualified, and I said "sure, why not?"  And here I am!((WN))  So you liked Vancouver?MP: It was just an amazing experience. I came into Vancouver... I had quite a bad accident on a downhill course in Sestriere about seven weeks out from the games, and I fractured my pelvis. So, I was coming into Vancouver with an injury and I  had only just recovered and was in quite a lot of pain. So it was an amazing experience and I was quite glad I did it, but wish for a different outcome.((WN))  So you are more optimistic about Sochi then?MP: Yes.((WN))  One of the things about skiing is that it's really expensive to do. How do you afford to ski given how expensive it is? And the fact that you need a guide who's got his own expenses.MP: I'm lucky enough to rank quite high in the world at the moment, so due to my ranking I'm awarded a certain amount of funding from the Australian Sports Commission, which covers my equipment and expenses, and the team picks up training costs and travel costs. All I've got to pay for is food and my own equipment, which is good, so I've managed to do it a budget.((WN))  What do you do outside of skiing, because you look kind of young? And you being not like, 30 or 40?MP: I'm 24. I'm a student still.((WN))  Which university?MP: University of Western Sydney. It's my third university degree. I've completed two others prior to this one that I'm doing now.((WN))  Which degree? That you're currently pursuing.MP: Currently, physiotherapy.((WN))  Because of your experience with sport?MP: Not really, except that my experience with sport certainly helped my interest and kind of fueled a direction to take in the physiotherapy field when I'm finished my degree, but more the medical side of injury, rehabilitation that got me interested in physiotherapy to begin with, burns rehabilitation and things like that.((WN))  You view yourself a full-time student as opposed to a full-time professional skier.MP: Not really. I'm a student when uni's on and when uni's finished I'm a skier. The way that the term structure is in Australia it gives me all this time to ski. The uni starts at the end of February and goes to the beginning of June, and then we've got a six or seven week break until beginning or mid-August, and uni starts again then, and we go up to mid way through November, and then we've got a break again. Skiing fits in very nicely to that.((WN))  What's the route for qualification to Sochi for you. MP: Just maintaining my points. At the moment I've qualified. I just need to maintain my points, keep my points under, and then I qualify for the Australian team.((WN))  So there's a chance they could say no?MP: If I'm skiing really badly. An injury.((WN))  Or if you're like those Australian swimmers who had the guns...MP: I've no sign of picking up a gun any time soon.  Giving a blind girl a gun is not a good idea. (laughs)((WN))  It just seemed to us that Sochi was so far away on out hand, and yet seemed to be in everybody's mind. It's on their program.  Sixteen months away?MP: Yes, something like that. Sixteen. I think it's been on our mind ever since Vancouver was over and done with. Next season, that was that, it was like: "what are our goals for the next four years?" And it was, "What are our goals for the next three years and two years?" And subsequently, next season, it's Sochi. What we need to work on, what we need to accomplish for then, to be as ready as possible.((WN))  What is your favourite event of all the skiing ones? You like the downhill because it's fast? Or you like Giant Slalom because it's technically challenging? Or...MP: I prefer the speed events.  The downhill; frightens me but I do love the adrenalin. I'm always keen to do a downhill. But I think Super G might just be my favourite.((WN))  Do you do any other adrenalin junkie type stuff? Do you go bungee jumping? Jumping out of airplanes? Snowboarding?MP: I don't snowboard, no. I have jumped out of a plane. I thought that was fun but downhill has got more adrenalin than jumping out of a plane, I found. I do mixed martial arts and judo. That's my other passion.((WN))  Have you thought of qualifying for the Summer [Para]lympics in judo?MP: As far as I know, Australia doesn't have a judo program for the Paralympics. But, if I ever get good enough, then sure.((WN))  They sent one.MP: They've sent one, and he's amazing. He beats up blind guys, able bodieds, quite constantly. I've seen video of him fight, and he's very very good. If I ever reach that level, then sure, it's something I'd look into it.((WN))  Does judo help with your skiing? MP: Yes, it increases my agility and balance, and strength, for sure.((WN))  I want to let you get back to changing. Thank you very much.Recently, Wikinews spent time with with Australian Paralympic skier Jonty O'Clallaghan who was in Copper Mountain, Colorado for the IPC Nor-Am Cup.((Wikinews))  I'm interviewing Jonty O'Callaghan, one of the Australian skiers with the IPC [International Paralympic Committee] Nor-Am Cup, and you're a fifteen-year-old?Jonty O'Callaghan: Yup. Yeah, I've been skiing since I was about ten and I really enjoy racing.((WN))  I talked to your father, he said you're kind of thinking Sochi?Jonty O'Callaghan: It's the matter of if I qualify by getting enough good races and points.((WN))  How do you balance skiing with doing school?Jonty O'Callaghan: Over the past few years in Australia I've been doing full time in tenth grade in the Australian winter, which means the school at the mountain brings up my work from my home school in Melbourne to do up at the mountain when I'm not skiing.((WN))  Since you're not on the development team, do you get enough support or your parents are supporting this?Jonty O'Callaghan: Yeah, my parents support me all the way. I've never doubted their support always though the journeys and I [thank them] for their support throughout and continuing through my journeys.((WN))  What classification are you?Jonty O'Callaghan: I am LW9-1.((WN))  What does that mean for people who know nothing about classification?Jonty O'Callaghan: I basically have a disability on the right side of my body.((WN))  Yep.Jonty O'Callaghan: which weakens two of my limbs and which means I favor my left side a lot more.((WN))  Did you have that from birth?Jonty O'Callaghan: Yeah, it was caused by premature birth.((WN))  Do you do any other sports anything other than skiing or are you one of those Australian ski bunnies?Jonty O'Callaghan: I've done a lot of sports doing my journey, I've always played cricket, Australian football, played a little tennis, and I like golf too as a hobby.((WN))  Are you going to and be one of those dual Paralympians for Winter and Summer? Jonty O'Callaghan: No, because I don't think any other sports I like are in the Summer Olympics. I think I'll pursue them after I finished my skiing career, because cricket you can do when you're much older.((WN))  Is there anything else people should know about you?Jonty O'Callaghan: Yeah, I'm just looking forward to the future and hoping for the best and maybe some medals.((WN))  Okay cool, thank you very much.Homebush Bay, New South Wales —On Friday, Wikinews sat down with first time Paraylympic Australian Gliders Leanne Del Toso, Sarah Vinci, and Amber Merritt, and second time Paralympic competitor Clare Nott at the Pullman Hotel following their 57–45 win against China at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge in Sydney.With South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius‎'s inclusion in the 2012 Summer Olympics as one of the most talked-about Paralympic stories, the players were asked their feelings about his inclusion in the Olympic Games.  As a group, they had mixed feelings.  One one hand, they felt his inclusion was a positive thing for people with disabilities.  On the other hand, they felt he could get a technological advantage from his blades. Del Toso said she could see that advantage based on her own use of splints for her legs.Related to the Pistorius‎ story, the Gliders were asked if they would favour the inclusion of 5 point players, able-bodied competitors, competing in their sport at the Paralympics.  As a group, they all said no, citing the numerous opportunities these players already had in Australia's domestic competition and in state competitions.  They felt their inclusion would deny opportunities to elite basketball players with disabilities to compete at the highest level.Merrit discussed problems with classification and her swimming career.  She started as a swimmer, but while she has a club foot, this was not severe enough to allow her to maintain a disability swimming classification: they said she should compete in able-bodied swimming as she could learn the style to swim correctly.  She was unable to do so and had to forgo swimming.  Following a talent identification program, she took up wheelchair basketball.Del Toso came into wheelchair basketball after acquiring, at the age of nineteen, a degenerative disease that effects her nerves.  She had previously played able-bodied basketball but had never considered playing wheelchair basketball until she participated in a talent identification event.With money being at the heart of many people's ability to take their game to the next level, the players were asked about their general financial situation in terms of the level of support they were receiving from Australian sport organizations.  They all indicated they received adequate funding from Basketball Australia, the Australian Sports Commission, and the Australian Paralympic Committee that allowed them to travel to games around the world and live comfortably, which contrasts to some other countries and sports where there is not a comparable level of support.When asked about the team's body posture on the bench and their volume, the players indicated they put their hands under their armpits for warmth as the building is cold: it was not body language intended to convey any feeling about what was happening on the floor.  The players also said their volume on the bench, while quiet, was effective and contrasted it to some teams who could be screechy, where volume is actually a sign of frustration with play.The Gliders start their London Paralympic campaign on August 30 against Brazil at 18:30 London time, August 31 at 3:30 Sydney time.Wikinews caught up with Australian wheelchair basketball coach David Gould in Canberra, where the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team — the Gliders — were having a training camp. Gould told Wikinews he retired from playing after the 2002 World Championships. He said he began coaching able bodied basketball at schools and clubs in South Australia. He was awarded a scholarship by Basketball Australia and the Australian Sports Commission, and became assistant coach of the Under 23 Men's team in November 2011. He is now national wheelchair skills coach, assistant coach of the men's and women's national teams, and coach of the Under 23 Men's and Under 25 Women's teams. He noted the Gliders have another training camp coming up in Brisbane in August. This is to be an open development camp any player can attend. Twelve players are to be selected for the Asia Oceania Zone (AOZ) Wheelchair Basketball Championships in Bangkok in November. The top three teams then qualify for the World Championships, to be held in Canada next year.He is acutely aware the Gliders have never won a World Championship or a Paralympics. But he has won a gold medal, with the men's team, the Rollers, in Atlanta in 1996. "We went on a tour of the United States beforehand", he recalled. Facing the United States in the United States was daunting. There was a huge crowd. So how did they do it? "We had confidence in ourselves, and stuck to our plan," he recalled.This, he said, is what he and Glider's head coach Tom Kyle are trying to teach the Gliders. To believe in the process. They take them out of their comfort zone, show them the right techniques, the right way to do things. The idea is to get the principles right. Gould told Wikinews they have to look not just to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio in 2016, but further ahead to 2020. They have to recruit new players and develop them. He said he took a Gliders team to the Osaka Cup with only four members of the 2012 team, in order to give members of the development team experience with international competition. He set up a mentor system whereby the six newcomers were each paired with one of the old hands. Wikinews was shown how the games are videoed and critiqued by the coaches. Special software allows the videos to be edited. Effects such as circling players can be added, along with captions and audio from the coaches. The edited video can then be downloaded by the players. Gould said there is a weekly video conference with the players.He considered video of other teams is an important training tool. He noted the Gliders had to play Brazil in the first match of the Paralympics in London, which was very tough, because so little was known about them. As it turned out, Brazil has a great program, and he thinks it could be a contender in front of a home crowd in Rio in 2016.Wikinews noted one of the Gliders, Amber Merritt, had her arm in a sling. Gould said her arm had been scanned, and the doctors will make their evaluation. Like most elite athletes, he knows about injury first hand. He told Wikinews he had injured his shoulder during the 2000 Olympics, and had to have it operated on afterwards. He said he did not want players playing injured, and sometimes it was better just to lose a week if you have the flu. He expected his players to be honest and up front with themselves, their coaches and their team.  "We need everyone on the same page", he told Wikinews. Gould told Wikinews the Asia Oceania Zone championships will feature Australia, Japan, China, Thailand, South Korea, and perhaps Hong Kong. The venue in Bangkok is well known to him, as the U23 Men's team have already played there. His plan is to arrive early, to allow the players to acclimatise to the high humidity and the food. Some of the U23 men got sick. He does not expect difficulty qualifying, but it is "one of the I's that have to be dotted and T's that have to be crossed." He said Australians intend to apply full pressure, but one of their objectives is also to help the competition. One of the problems in Australia is that it takes a long time to go anywhere, he told Wikinews. By building up the teams in the Asia Oceania Zone, he hopes Australian teams will not have to travel so much or so far to meet first class competition.Sunday, Wikinews sat down with Australian Paralympic guide skier Andrew Bor who was participating in a national team training camp in Vail, Colorado.((Wikinews))  This is Andrew Bor, who is Melissa Perrine's guide skier. How did you become a guide?Andrew Bor: I was coaching with the team, the September before the games here. And the APC [Australian Paralympic Committee] found out, I'm not sure how, sent Melissa out to New Zealand where there was a training camp. She didn't have a guide. And one of the coaches chose me to guide Mel.((WN))  Had you done much guiding before? Andrew Bor: Two days. Guided a visually impaired athlete twice before that.((WN))  Was there a steep learning curve?Andrew Bor: Yeah, very steep learning curve. Still learning.((WN))  Is it more difficult as a male guide with a female skier, do you think, because the rules require you to use male ski equipment? Andrew Bor: No. No, I don't think so. I don't think there's any issue with that. The skis make a different radius turn. Sometimes. No, I don't think it makes a huge difference.((WN))  As a guide skier, do you think that guides should be getting medals when their skier gets a medal? Are you that important?Andrew Bor: No, I don't know. It's the athlete's performance really.((WN))  But you're an athlete aren't you?Andrew Bor: No. I'm their eyes if that makes any sense. If they don't have the commitment to go down the hill, you're never going to get them to go fast anyway. The guide's responsibility is to put them in the right place. But beyond that...((WN))  You've gotten support because of the performance in Vancouver? The government has been supporting you guys?Andrew Bor: The government has decided to support the guides as equally as the athletes. Before I was employed by the APC, and now I don't get paid by the APC, I get the same support levels. Otherwise, you can't do it, you can't afford the time.((WN))  Why have you chosen skiing as opposed to oh, waterskiing or some other sport?Andrew Bor: I've worked in this industry for about 20 years. Teaching skiing, coaching. It's not something I chose to do, it's something that kind of happened. After a while a door closed, a door opened. I enjoy the environment. Working outdoors and work in some lovely places. You get some great days when there's blue sky and sunshine and other days in Australia where it might be two degrees and raining. But it beats working in an office.((WN))  Do you think the classification system for blind skiers works and is a good one? Especially with the factoring issues, and you're competing with B1, B2, B3, all compete against each other. Andrew Bor: Yeah, I don't know. I don't think there's a big enough pool of athletes to have three different classes. It's never going to be ideal. Different classes have different issues. The handicap for the twos and the threes is fairly similar across the different disciplines. Maybe the threes have an advantage in the tech because they can see a bit more, but they have a bit of a disadvantage in the speed because they can't see enough to see the next gate and have to rely on the guide. Bit of a trade off. It's never going to be perfect. It's a tough one.((WN))  Are you planning to go to Sochi with Melissa? Andrew Bor:  Yes.  Yes I am.((WN))  Do you think you guys have, you and Melissa can pick up a medal, and you get a medal?Andrew Bor:  I think Melissa is yeah. I think Melissa has a fairly good chance. You know, if things fall in place. I think she's got an opportunity to win at least a medal. If things don't fall in place. Yeah. She might miss out completely.((WN))  Do you plan to continue guide skiing with Melissa for a period following Sochi, or are you going to be like "I've had enough, I'm getting old, these mountains are really tall, I'm going to retire?" Andrew Bor: I don't know. We'll wait and see. At the moment the commitment is until Sochi. You see with athletes, some announce their retirement early. Depends what Melissa wants to do. Depends on whether you achieve the goals that she sets or not. Whether she's got unfinished business...((WN))  But at the moment, the goal is Sochi?Andrew Bor: The goal is Sochi, yes. You've got to have an end goal, and at the moment it's Sochi. The energy of the last four years has been put into that. There's been a commitment for her to go to Sochi, and at the same time you've got to commit to the same thing. The guide-to-athlete thing is a relationship that takes time to build and work out the needs of the athlete and the wants of the athlete. Beyond Sochi, don't know.  We'll see.Sunday, Wikinews sat down with Australian blind Paralympic skier Jessica Gallagher and her guide Eric Bickerton who are participating in a national team training camp in Vail, Colorado.((Wikinews))  This is Jessica Gallagher. She's competing at the IPC NorAm cup this coming week.Jessica Gallagher: I'm not competing at Copper Mountain.((WN))  You're not competing?Jessica Gallagher: No.((WN))  You're just here?Jessica Gallagher: We're in training. I've got a race at Winner Park, but we aren't racing at Copper.((WN))  So.  Your guide is Eric Bickerton, and he did win a medal in women's downhill blind skiing.Jessica Gallagher: Yes!((WN))  Despite the fact that he is neither a woman nor blind. Jessica Gallagher: No, he loves telling people that he was the first Australian female Paralympic woman to win a medal. One of the ironies.((WN))  The IPC's website doesn't list guides on their medal things. Are they doing that because they don't want — you realise this is not all about you per se — Is it because they are trying to keep off the able bodied people to make the Paralympics seem more pure for people with disabilities?Jessica Gallagher: Look, I don't know but I completely disagree if they don't have the guides up there. Because it's pretty plain and simple: I wouldn't be skiing if it wasn't with him. Being legally blind you do have limitations and that's just reality. We're certainly able to overcome most of them. And when it comes to skiing on a mountain the reason I'm able to overcome having 8 per cent vision is that I have a guide. So I think it's pretty poor if they don't have the information up there because he does as much work as I do. He's an athlete as much as I am. If he crashes we're both out. He's drug tested. He's as important as I am on a race course. So I would strongly hope that they would put it up there. Here's Eric!Eric Bickerton: Pleased to met you.((WN))  We've been having a great debate about whether or not you've won a medal in women's blind downhill skiing. Eric Bickerton: Yes, I won it. I've got it.((WN))  I found a picture of you on the ABC web site. Both of you were there, holding your medals up. The IPC's web site doesn't credit you. Jessica Gallagher: I'm surprised by that.Eric Bickerton: That's unusual, yeah.((WN))  One of the things that was mentioned earlier, most delightful about you guys is you were racing and "we were halfway down the course and we lost communication!" How does a blind skier deal with...Jessica Gallagher: Funny now. Was bloody scary.((WN))  What race was that?Jessica Gallagher: It was the Giant Slalom in Vancouver at the Paralympics. Actually, we were talking about this before. It's one of the unique aspects of wearing headsets and being able to communicate. All the time while we were on the mountain earlier today, Eric had a stack and all he could hear as he was tumbling down was me laughing.Eric Bickerton: Yes... I wasn't feeling the love.Jessica Gallagher: But um... what was the question please?((WN))  I couldn't imagine anything scarier than charging down the mountain at high speed and losing that communications link. Jessica Gallagher: The difficulty was in the Giant Slalom, it was raining, and being used to ski racing, I had never experienced skiing in the rain, and as soon as I came out of the start hut I lost all my sight, which is something that I had never experienced before. Only having 8 per cent you treasure it and to lose all of it was a huge shock. And then when I couldn't hear Eric talking I realised that our headsets had malfunctioned because they'd actually got rain into them. Which normally wouldn't happen in the mountains because it would be snow. So it was the scariest moment of my life. Going down it was about getting to the bottom in one piece, not racing to win a medal, which was pretty difficult I guess or frustrating, given that it was the Paralympics.((WN))  I asked the standing guys upstairs: who is the craziest amongst all you skiers: the ones who can't see, the ones on the mono skis, or the one-legged or no-armed guys. Who is the craziest one on the slopes?Jessica Gallagher: I think the completely blind. If I was completely blind I wouldn't ski. Some of the sit skiers are pretty crazy as well.((WN))  You have full control over your skis though. You have both legs and both arms. Jessica Gallagher: True, but you've got absolutely no idea where you're going. And you have to have complete reliance on a person. Trust that they are able to give you the right directions. That you are actually going in the right direction. It's difficult with the sight that I have but I couldn't imagine doing it with no sight at all.((WN))  The two of you train together all the time?Eric Bickerton: Pretty well, yes.Jessica Gallagher: Yes, everything on snow basically is together. One of the difficult things I guess is we have to have that 100 per cent communication and trust between one another and a lot of the female skiers on the circuit, their guide is their husband. That's kind of a trust relationship. Eric does say that at times it feels like we're married, but...Eric Bickerton: I keep checking for my wallet.Jessica Gallagher: ...it's always about constantly trying to continue to build that relationship so that eventually I just... You put your life in his hands and whatever he says, you do, kind of thing.((WN))  Of the two sport, winter sports and summer sports person, how do you find that balance between one sport and the other sport?Jessica Gallagher: It's not easy. Yeah, it's not easy at all. Yesterday was my first day on snow since March 16, 2010. And that was mainly because of the build up obviously for London and the times when I was going to ski I was injured. So, to not have skied for that long is obviously a huge disadvantage when all the girls have been racing the circuit since... and it's vice versa with track and field. So I've got an amazing team at the Victorian Institute of Sport. I call them my little A Team of strength and mission coach, physio, osteopath, soft tissue therapist, sport psychologist, dietician. Basically everyone has expertise in the area and we come together and having meetings and plan four years ahead and say at the moment Sochi's the goal, but Rio's still in the back of the head, and knowing my body so well now that I've done both sports for five years means that I can know where they've made mistakes, and I know where things have gone really well, so we can plan ahead for that and prepare so that the things that did go wrong won't happen again. To make sure that I get to each competition in peak tone.((WN))  What things went wrong?Jessica Gallagher: Mainly injuries. So, that's the most difficult thing with doing two sports. Track and field is an explosive power; long jump and javelin are over four to six seconds of maximum effort. Ski racing, you are on a course, for a minute to a minute and a half, so it's a speed endurance event. And the two couldn't be further apart in terms of the capabilities and the capacities that you need as an athlete. So one of the big things I guess, after the Vancouver campaign, being in ski boots for so long, I had lost a lot of muscle from my calves so they weren't actually firing properly, and when you're trying to run and jump and you don't have half of your leg working properly it makes it pretty difficult to jump a good distance. Those kind of things. So I'm skiing now but when I'm in a gym doing recovery and rehab or prehab stuff, I've got calf raising, I've got hamstring exercises because I know they're the weaker areas that if I'm not working on at the moment they're two muscle groups that don't get worked during ski. That I need to do the extra stuff on the side so that when I transition back to track and field I don't have any soft tissue injuries like strains because of the fact that I know they're weaker so...((WN))  Do you prefer one over the other? Do you say "I'd really rather be out on the slopes than jogging and jumping the same...Jessica Gallagher: I get asked that a lot. I think I love them for different reasons and I hate them for different reasons so I think at the end of the day I would prefer ski racing mainly because of the lifestyle. I think ski racing is a lot harder than track and field to medal in but I love the fact that I get to come to amazing resorts and get to travel the world. But I think, at the end of the day I get the best of both worlds. By the time my body has had enough of cold weather and of traveling I get to go home and be in the summer and be on a track in such a stable environment, which is something that visually impaired people love because it's familiar and you know what to expect. Whereas in this environment it's not, every racecourse we use is completely different.((WN))  I heard you were an average snowboarder. How disappointed were you when you when they said no to your classifications?Jessica Gallagher: Very disappointed! For Sochi you mean?((WN))  YesJessica Gallagher: Yeah. I mean we weren't really expecting it. Mainly because they've brought in snowboard cross, and I couldn't imagine four blind athletes and four guides going down the same course together at the same time. That would be a disaster waiting to happen. But I guess having been a snowboarder for... as soon as we found snowboarding had been put in, I rang Steve, the head coach, and said can we do snowboarding? When I rang Steve I said, don't worry, I've already found out that Eric can snowboard. It would have been amazing to have been able to compete in both. Maybe next games.((WN))  So you also snowboard?Eric Bickerton: Yes.((WN))  So she does a lot of sports and you also do a crazy number of sports? Eric Bickerton: Uh, yeah?((WN))  Summer sports as well as winter sports?Eric Bickerton: Me?((WN))  Yes. Eric Bickerton: Through my sporting career.  I've played rugby union, rugby league, soccer, early days, I played for the Australian Colts, overseas, rugby union. I spend most of my life sailing competitively and socially. Snow skiing. Yeah. Kite boarding and trying to surf again.((WN))  That's a lot of sports! Does Jessica need guides for all of them?Eric Bickerton: I've played sport all my life. I started with cricket. I've played competition squash. I raced for Australia in surfing sailing. Played rugby union.((WN))  Most of us have played sport all our lives, but there's a difference between playing sport and playing sport at a high level, and the higher level you go, the more specialized you tend to become. And here [we're] looking at two exceptions to that.Eric Bickerton: I suppose that I can round that out by saying to you that I don't think that I would ever reach the pinnacle. I'm not prepared to spend ten years dedicated to that one thing. And to get that last ten per cent or five percent of performance at that level. That's what you've got to do. So I'll play everything to a reasonable level, but to get to that really, really highest peak level you have to give up everything else.((WN))  When you go to the pub, do your mates make fun of you for having a medal in women's blind skiing?Eric Bickerton: No, not really.Jessica Gallagher: Usually they say "I love it!" and "This is pretty cool!"Eric Bickerton: We started at the Olympics. We went out into the crowd to meet Jess' mum, and we had our medals. There were two of us and we were waiting for her mum to come back and in that two hour period there was at least a hundred and fifty people from all over the world who wore our medals and took photographs. My medal's been all over Australia.((WN))  Going to a completely different issue, blind sports have three classifications, that are medical, unlike everybody else, who've got functional ability [classifications]. You've got the only medical ones. Do you think the blind classifications are fair in terms of how they operate? Or should there be changes? And how that works in terms of the IPC?Jessica Gallagher: Yeah. I think the system they've got in place is good, in terms of having the three classes. You've got completely blind which are B1s, less than 5 percent, which are B2, and less than 10 percent is a B3. I think those systems work really well. I guess one of the difficult things with vision impairment is that there are so many diseases and conditions that everyone's sight is completely different, and they have that problem with the other classes as well. But in terms of the class system itself I think having the three works really well. What do you think?Eric Bickerton: I think the classification system itself's fine. It's the one or two grey areas, people: are they there or are they there?((WN))  That affected you in Beijing.Jessica Gallagher: Yeah. That was obviously really disappointing, but, ironic as well in that one of my eyes is point zero one of a percent too sighted, so one's eligible, the other's just outside their criteria, which left me unable to compete. Because my condition is degenerative. They knew that my sight would get worse. I guess I was in a fortunate position where once my sight deteriorated I was going to become eligible. There are some of the classes, if you don't have a degenerate condition, that's not possible. No one ever wants to lose their best sight, but that was one positive.((WN))  On some national competitions they have a B4 class. Do you think those should be eligible? In terms of the international competition?Jessica Gallagher: Which sports have B4s?((WN))  There's a level down, it's not used internationally, I think it's only used for domestic competitions. I know the UK uses it.Jessica Gallagher: I think I... A particular one. For social reasons, that's a great thing, but I think if it's, yeah. I don't know if I would... I think socially to get more Paralympic athletes involved in the sport if they've got a degenerative condition on that border then they should be allowed to compete but obviously... I don't think they should be able to receive any medals at a national competition or anything like that. So I was, after Beijing, I was able to fore-run races. I was able to transition over to skiing even though at that stage I wasn't eligible. So that was great for us. The IPC knew that my eyesight was going to get worse. So I was able to fore-run races.  Which was a really good experience for us, when we did get to that level. So I think, with the lack of numbers in Paralympic sport, more that you should encourage athletes and give them those opportunities, it's a great thing. But I guess it's about the athletes realizing that you're in it for the participation, and to grow as an athlete rather than to win medals. I don't think the system should be changed. I think three classes is enough. Where the B3 line is compared with a B4 is legally blind. And I think that covers everything. I think that's the stage where you have low enough vision to be considered a Paralympic sport as opposed to I guess an able bodied athlete. And that's with all forms of like, with government pensions, with bus passes, all that sort of stuff, that the cut off line is legally blind, so I think that's a good place to keep it.((WN))  Veering away from this, I remember watching the Melbourne Cup stuff on television, and there you were, I think you were wearing some hat or something. Jessica Gallagher: Yeah, my friend's a milliner. They were real flowers, real orchids.((WN))  Are you basically a professional athlete who has enough money or sponsorship to do that sort of stuff? I was saying, there's Jessica Gallagher! She was in London! That's so cool!Jessica Gallagher: There are two organizations that I'm an ambassador for, and one of them is Vision Australia, who were a charity for the Melbourne Cup Carnival. So as part of my ambassador role I was at the races helping them raise money. And that involves media stuff, so that was the reason I was there. I didn't get paid.((WN))  But if you're not getting paid to be a sponsor for all that is awesome in Australia, what do you do outside of skiing, and the long jump, and the javelin?Jessica Gallagher: I'm an osteopath. So I finished my masters' degree in 2009. I was completing a bachelor's and a masters. I was working for the Victorian Institute of Sport guiding program but with the commitment to London having so much travel I actually just put everything on hold in terms of my osteo career. There's not really enough time. And then the ambassador role, I had a few commitments with that, and I did motivational speaking.((WN))  That's very cool. Eric, I've read that you work as a guide in back country skiing, and all sorts of crazy stuff like that. What do you do when you're not leading Jessica Gallagher down a ski slope?Eric Bickerton: I'm the Chief Executive of Disabled Winter Sports Australia. So we look after all the disability winter sports, except for the Paralympics.Jessica Gallagher: Social, recreational...((WN))  You like that? You find it fulfilling?Eric Bickerton: The skiing aspect's good. I dunno about the corporate stuff. I could give that a miss. But I think it is quite fulfilling. Yeah, they're a very good group of people there who enjoy themselves, both in disabilities and able bodied. We really need guides and support staff.((WN))  Has it changed over the last few years?Eric Bickerton: For us?((WN))  Being a guide in general? How things have changed or improved, have you been given more recognition?Eric Bickerton: No. I don't see myself as an athlete. Legally we are the athlete. If I fail, she fails. We ski the exact same course. But there's some idiosyncrasies associated with it. Because I'm a male guiding, I have to ski on male skis, which are different to female skis, which means my turn shape I have to control differently so it's the same as her turn shape. It's a little bit silly. Whereas if I was a female guiding, I'd be on exactly the same skis, and we'd be able to ski exactly the same all the way through. In that context I think the fact that Jess won the medal opened the eyes to the APC about visual impairment as a definite medal contending aspect. The biggest impediment to the whole process is how the Hell do you get a guide who's (a) capable, (b) available and (c) able to fund himself. So we're fortunate that the APC pushed for the recognition of myself as an athlete, and because we have the medal from the previous Olympics, we're now tier one, so we get the government funding all way through. Without that two years before the last games, that cost me fifteen, sixteen months of my time, and $40,000 of cash to be the guide. So while I enjoyed it, and well I did, it is very very hard to say that a guide could make a career out of being a guide. There needs to be a little bit more consideration of that, a bit like the IPC saying no you're not a medal winner. It's quite a silly situation where it's written into the rules that you are both the athlete and yet at the same time you're not a medal winner. I think there's evolution. It's growing. It's changing. It's very, very difficult.((WN))  Are you guys happy with the media coverage on the winter side? Do you think there's a bias — obviously there is a bias towards the Summer Paralympics. Do the winter people get a fair shake?Eric Bickerton: I think it's fair. It's reasonable. And there's certainly a lot more than what it used to be. Winter sports in general, just from an Australian perspective is something that's not well covered. But I'd say the coverage from the last Paralympics, the Para Winter Olympics was great, as far as an evolution of the coverage goes.((WN))  Nothing like winning a medal, though, to lift the profile of a sport. Jessica Gallagher: And I think that certainly helped after Vancouver. Not just Paralympics but able bodied with Lydia [Lassila] and Torah [Bright] winning, and then to have Eric and I win a medal, to finally have an Aussie female who has a winter Paralympic medal. I guess there can be misconceptions, I mean the winter team is so small in comparison to the summer team, they are always going to have a lot more coverage just purely based on numbers. There were 160 [Australian] athletes that were at London and not going to be many of us in Sochi. Sorry. Not even ten, actually.Eric Bickerton: There's five athletes.Jessica Gallagher: There's five at the moment, yeah. So a lot of the time I think with Paralympic sport, at the moment, APC are doing great things to get a lot of coverage for the team and that, but I think also individually, it's growing. I've certainly noticed a lot more over the past two years but Eric and I are in a very unique situation. For me as well being both a summer and a winter Paralympian, there's more interest I guess. I think with London it opened Australia and the word's eyes to Paralympic sport, so the coverage from that hopefully will continue through Sochi and I'll get a lot more people covered, but I know prior to Beijing and Vancouver, compared to my build up to London, in terms of media, it was worlds apart in terms of the amount of things I did and the profile pieces that were created. So that was great to see that people are actually starting to understand and see what it's like.Recently, Wikinews sat down with Australian standing Paralympic skiers Toby Kane, Cameron Rahles-Rahbula, and Mitchell Gourley who were in Vail, Colorado for a training camp for the start of this week's IPC Nor-Am Cup.((Wikinews))  I'm interviewing Cameron [Rahles-Rahbula] with a hyphenated last name, Mitchell Gourley, [and] Toby Kane. And they're in Copper Mountain to compete with the IPC NorAm cup. Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Yes.((WN))  So you guys can qualify for Sochi?Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Not this race, but yeah...Toby Kane: Any races that we kind of do, I think we can qualify, but technically, for the APC it would have to be a world cup first to qualify.((WN))  Where's the world cups?Toby Kane: We have one this year in Italy, in Sestriere, and one in St Moritz, in Switzerland...Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: and one in Slovenia, in Maribor, and Russia...Mitchell Gourley: world championships in La Molina in Spain as well, and Russia, the test event is another world cup in Sochi.((WN))  You guys are all skiers, right?all (in unison): Yes.((WN))  None of you, when they said "we're doing snowboarding", said "I want to jump ship and do snowboarding"?Toby Kane: No.Mitchell Gourley: No.Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: No.((WN))  You all love the skiing.((WN))  (to Cameron Rahles-Rahbula): What did you do to your chin [which is taped up]?Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: I had a crash last week, and I split my chin open. I kneed myself here, so I had stitches.Toby Kane: Thirteen stitches.((WN))  Crashed skiing right? Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Yeah.Toby Kane: Our physio probably took out five last night.((WN))  As somebody who knows very little about Paralympic skiing, I have a question having watched it. There seems to be three types skiiers: the ones who are in the monochairs, the ones who are blind, and the ones with amputations and the ones without arms. I've had this debate. Who's the craziest amongst you? The ones who can't see, the ones with no arms, or the ones on a mono-ski?Mitchell Gourley: The completely blind people are a little nuts.Toby Kane: A B1 is, blacked out goggles...Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: ... who just follows the sound of their guides. So they're probably, when it comes to speed events, in terms of fear level, that's pretty intense.((WN))  Not having arms, you don't think, would be scarier?Mitchell Gourley: No.Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Yeah, but you can see where you are going. When you have to trust the other person in front of you...Toby Kane: .. you have to be fairly crazy to do downhill in sit skis.Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Those guys, they start crashing, or they have a mistake, they can't recover in the same way a stand up can, so even though those classes aren't going as quickly, probably stand ups in general have a bit more control, and to recover.((WN))  Can you go and tell me your classifications?Toby Kane: Yeah, we all ski in the standing class. LW6/8-2((WN))  Like L1...Mitchell Gourley: These guys are both LW2s because they've both got on leg.Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: So we ski with just one leg, with crutches, whereas you've got people who've got below-knee amputations, they may have a longer stump and they ski with a prosthetic leg. Toby and I have got to legally ski on one ski.Toby Kane: And what you were referring to before was the three classes of alpine skiing is standing, sitting, and blind.((WN))  So you've all been to Paralympics before?Toby Kane: Cam's been to three, I've been to two, and Mitch has been to one.((WN))  And what was your favorite one? Do you have one? Mitchell Gourley: Vancouver. (laughter)Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Vancouver it would have been.((WN))  Because you love Canadians?Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: It's also, obviously, skiing comes down to results. So, I loved Salt Lake City. I was there for experience, that was great. My second one, I had bit of a disaster Paralympics. I didn't ski too well. Sestriere in 2006. The last one, I was able to come away with a couple of medals, so it was... I enjoyed that obviously. They all had different aspects.((WN))  How did the ski slopes compare?Toby Kane: Vancouver, they're good slopes.Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Salt Lake City, was a little bit flatter. Probably the type of hill... it was still good, it was my first games, I enjoyed it. Yeah, they usually prepare the courses reasonably well, 'cause they've got a lot of course workers on the slopes. That has a big influence on condition, not just the actual hill itself. Vancouver was a challenge in the sense that we had terrible weather, terrible conditions and snow, even though it's a good hill, whereas I think Sestriere we had sunshine virtually every day. So a lot of it comes down to weather as well as the hill, the time of year.((WN))  In Australia, the big visibility Paralympics are the summer. Do you guys ever feel vaguely — I know it's the wrong question to ask — but do you ever feel vaguely cheated because you're doing neglected, you don't get the attention, the ABC's like "nah, we don't want to cover you"? Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: umm...Toby Kane: Give us the official answer? (laughter, interjections from elsewhere in the room)Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Australia being a summer sport [country], we're aware that there's going to be more focus on the summer games and particularly because there's a larger... there's more athletes, there more events, there more medals. There will always be more coverage for the summer games. There's no winter athlete that could walk away with more than five gold medals. There's not enough events for that. Whereas I think you can get a swimmer who might get eight gold medals. So, it's a different sort of exposure.Mitchell Gourley: And realistically, it's pretty unlikely for anybody in winter sport no matter how good they are, to walk away with more than one or two, just because of the nature of the sport, which is that anyone can crash. You can be a great skier all the year and then crash.  [uncertain] can tell you about that in Vancouver. It's a pretty unpredictable sport.Toby Kane: The way that our sport moved after Salt Lake City is that instead of Cam and I skiing against each other, and only people with one leg, to being really competitive across those three classes, means that we think that the winter games are really, really competitive. Quite difficult to win a medal. I think, if you took Michael Milton as an example, he won four gold at Salt Lake out of four events. He won one silver in Torino out of four events with the new system, and he compared both events to be equal. So, yeah, I think you've got to look at the value of the medals at the winter games now has been quite high.((WN))  So you guys like the new point system they implemented?Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: There's always challenges, because you've got different classes, and varied conditions, so they try and adapt the times to fit, but it'll never be something that can be always right, because we've got a sport that's got different conditions, and different locations, as opposed to a swimming pool, where you know you've got fifty metres.  So that's something that'll always be a challenge, but in saying that, it has raised the bar, in terms of the standard of skiing, which is good. From an Australian perspective, not necessarily the public will be aware of that but I think from an international perspective, the skiing has moved into a more professional area, which is good, and I think that it will be the best thing for the sport moving forward.((WN))  Evan O'Hanlon at the summer games was talking about the disparity problem between able bodied athletes and athletes with disabilities in terms of sponsorship. You guys have no visibility, is that something that you guys sit there going "we should have the same sponsorship as the great Australian skiers"? Mitchell Gourley: The problem in that is that in our sport we would probably be the most visible alpine skiers from Australia. The able bodied alpine team is pretty average and has been for a few years now, since a couple of guys retired after Vancouver. So we're probably, while its still very small, it's a lot less than the summer guys, even the summer Paralympics guys, were are more visible than the Australian alpine team.Toby Kane: I think a few of us, well Cam and I and I think Mitch is along the same lines, is that we're not here for a career as an athlete. so I know I haven't actively a lot of sponsorships. I have a life away from skiing with what I'm doing at the university and I'm here because I really love to do it, and I love to compete, but I'm not overly fussed about the public recognition of it all. I'm more concerned with skiing with our able-bodied counterparts and showing them what we can do.((WN))  Do you guys get equal treatment? Your share of the same facilities, same trainers, that sort of stuff? Toby Kane: We train on the same hills.Mitchell Gourley: And last week we had pretty much the same races as the able-bodied had the week before on the same hills, and what they ski on next week, and we follow on that, so we don't have to start. But with a hundred of... that's why I'm a level below world cup for able-bodied skiers, and skiing on the same hill, and running pretty comparable times, and getting a lot of comments from coaches and athletes there. And yeah that's what we all, I think, strive for. It's an awkward thing to ever try and illustrate it to the Australian public, ski racing, and let alone Paralympic ski racing, and what we're doing. So [...] we've got to accept that we're not going to get the recognition publicly probably that we may or may not deserve, and we more look towards our peers, whether they're able bodied or disabled, and if they respect us, if the best able bodied skiers in the world respect what we are doing, and think that we are doing it bloody well, then we can hold our head high and feel really good. Had one of the best slalom skiers in the world walk up to me a few years ago when we were in training, and say "that's some of the best slalom skiing that I've ever seen, wow that's incredible. One-legged. I couldn't do that on one leg". That kind of thing. So that obviously makes us all feel like we're doing something that while the recognition might not be there from the public, that we feel as though we are doing a really competitive and really difficult sport, and doing it to a really high level.((WN))  You mentioned Australia being like a country of summer sports. What attracted you to winter sport in the first place?Mitchell Gourley: I think it's a better sport. (laughter)Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Australians, considering we don't have many hills, Australians do love skiing, those that do it. It's a unique sport in the sense that you get to travel at high speeds, on different mountains all over the world, under your own power, going down a hill at 130 or something k's an hour, that sort of thing. You don't get... to me, running up and down a track, or...Toby Kane: I think to me it's a fun sport. There aren't that many sports that people, a lot of people, spend heaps of their own money to go and do, as a pastime. As something that they want to do on the holidays and with their family and all that kind of stuff. It's kind of cool that that's what we do. Like, lots of people would spend a sh-tload of money to go skiing, and that's our sport. Not many people would pay a heap of money to stare at a black line in a pool, or to run around a track against the clock.Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: Yeah, we love it, and that's why I've done it for so many years, because I love the sport. I mean, racing's one thing but if I didn't enjoy skiing I wouldn't be here and there's not a day when... I mean you have cold days and weather and stuff, but you don't... for us to get out and get on the hill isn't a burden I don't think in the same way as other sports can be.Toby Kane: I think the change for me — I think I can speak for Cam as well, 'cause he's been around for a while — the change between racing in so many classes to racing in so few probably kept us around, I think. It made it a lot more competitive; it made it a lot more of a challenge, that previously it wouldn't have been, and I think if we took an LW2 class right now we'd be getting similar results to what Michael got in Salt Lake City, so, the fact that it did get a lot more competitive is probably why I've been here for so long, in the challenge to keep competing and keep improving and keep performing at the highest level.((WN))  Are there any skiers that you're looking forward to racing against this week coming up? Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: This week I think Australia has a pretty good, strong team from a standing perspective, so we're probably racing against each other.((WN))  So you do not care about the Chileans, or whoever, hanging around?Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: The Canadian and American teams are here, and they've got some developing athletes. Probably more the Europeans who are developing who've got the highest others skiing in our particular division, and the Americans are very strong with their sit skiers. So this week being just a North American-based race we'll probably be looking at the other two in terms of racing, but yeah, when we get over to the world cups over in Europe in January, that's when the whole field's together, and gives us some idea of what we're racing against.((WN))  I feel like we're almost coming to a close. What do you do outside of skiing? You had some life you said.Cameron Rahles-Rahbula: I work as a physiotherapist, and I am a family man. Since Vancouver I haven't skied a huge amount since then. I've got a little boy, and so other priorities definitely start to take effect. I think as a skier, it's a challenge from the travelling perspective when you do have family. I think that's unlike a lot of summer athletes who have their training base next door. For us, we need to be always on the move, so that's always one of the challenges with alpine skiing.  You get the privilege of travelling but you're away from your family, so for me, my last year I have focused more on family life and sort of getting back into the skiing this year.((WN))  What do you do Mitchell?Mitchell Gourley: I'm still studying. I'm a bit younger than these guys so I'm...((WN))  Which university?Mitchell Gourley: I'm at Melbourne University studying. So I've got pretty much a year to go now, but that'll take me two years to do just because of where Sochi is, in March 2014 I'll cut back this year coming, 2013, and I'll only do probably about half — I'll do five subjects as opposed to eight, just because when you're out travelling during the year and prepping, using your weekend to ski will it getting to you like that. With the schedule, from June to the end September will be pretty much flat skiing. Last time I did that leading into Vancouver, I mean I do that every year but probably a bigger load in the games lead that kind of thing. And I did that in the middle of Year 12 last time, and that was interesting, but now I can actually...((WN))  You finished your VCEs then?Mitchell Gourley: I finished that during the...((WN))  And you did well?Mitchell Gourley: Yeah, I was happy with how I went, so that was good of me. I moved schools to pursue what I was doing with skiing, to an international school that really helped structure things around me with my environment, and I sort of cut back on subjects and things but managed to make it work those times, but yeah. For me, it's university for a couple of years, or for a year and a half or so to knock that over. So then I have to think about getting a real job and that's a scary thought, a real job, or eventually doing further study, based on the Melbourne model, being what it is now that you can't usually do much with your first degree. (laughter)((WN))  And Toby, what are..?Toby Kane: I'm halfway through postgraduate medicine, so I am just trying to balance that and getting in to Russia. And Russia will be my third games, and most probably my last. And then it'll be the start of my fourth year of medicine so, yeah, I'm a bit like Cam, I've skied probably less over the last two years since Vancouver, just with uni and I'm kind of looking forward to putting everything that I've got left in me into skiing until Russia.((WN))  Thank you very, very much. It was much appreciated. ((WN))  Look forward to seeing you guys in Russia!Recently, Wikinews spent time with with Australian Paralympic wheelchair basketballer Shelley Chaplin.((Wikinews))  Interview with Shelley Chaplin. First of all, what position do you play?Shelley Chaplin: Usually a point guard.((WN))  Right. And whenever I go to see the basketball in Canberra, we pass by a glass case. In the case is a guernsey with number twelve on it, and a big sign that says that this was the guernsey worn by Shelley Chaplin...Shelley Chaplin: That's me! That's my...((WN))  It's signed by the rest of the team, if you look — press your nose to the glass and look really close. How did that come to be there?Shelley Chaplin: It's actually the singlet that I wore in Beijing. Usually you get people to sign stuff. Anyway, the AIS just asked everybody if we would donate something [...]. I wasn't using it so, yeah, I gave them that.((WN))  Oh okay.Shelley Chaplin: I don't think they have it... It's been there for a while now. It think that was a four year loan or something like that.((WN))  I think it's been there for longer than that.Shelley Chaplin: It's been there for longer than that. Or — it must be four years around about now. Went in just after Beijing.((WN))  So they'll return that to you?Shelley Chaplin: They'll return it at some point. I mean, I like it. It's nice to have it there. It's good that they have some stuff from wheelchair basketball there, and I don't need it, so, yeah.((WN))  How did you get into playing wheelchair basketball? Shelley Chaplin: After the Atlanta Paralympics actually. There was a welcome home parade in Melbourne. So I never knew anything about wheelchair sports before that. And I went to the parade, and I used to walk around, but that day I used a wheelchair because I was really tired, and someone just approached me and said "Hey, do you know anything about wheelchair sports? You should get involved!" And, yeah, so I did! I tried everything, and I liked basketball the most.((WN))  And you're a three point player?Shelley Chaplin: Three point five.((WN))  I'd never seen the game before. My first experience of it was when the Gliders came out on the court for that first game [in London], and I was really taken with the sport from the word go. It has a sort of grace that normal basketball lacks. But otherwise it's very similar.Shelley Chaplin: Yeah! I think people are often quite surprised by wheelchair basketball, what it is when they actually see it. I think the name "wheelchair" basketball means disability obviously, but when you watch it there's nothing about disability to it at all. Just that we use wheelchairs, and that's it. It's just another sport.((WN))  People in the press gallery were saying "I've just got to get out in a chair and..."Shelley Chaplin: Try it! Yeah!((WN))  So how did you get to go to Illinois? Shelley Chaplin: After the Athens Paralympics...((WN))  You won the bronze medal there?Shelley Chaplin: No, we won silver in Athens...((WN))  Silver in Athens, bronze in Beijing. Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, while I was over there I met one of the American girls, and she was about to take up a scholarship there. And so I ended up meeting the coach, who was in Athens coaching the Canadian men's team. So I ended up meeting him, and chatting to him about maybe going over there, and then when I got home I followed it up, and they offered me a scholarship, so I took it. So he'd already seen me play at the Paralympics, and knew who I was, so it was good.((WN))  Which lead to what we ran on the front page of Wikipedia.Shelley Chaplin: Oh yeah! I saw that! That was great!((WN))  That's why I rang up up and asked for your birth place. Somebody raised an objection, and said maybe she was born in the US.Shelley Chaplin: Nope!((WN))  I thought that was pretty spectacular, because there's not a lot of athletes in any sport that have done that [been All-American without being American].Shelley Chaplin: Cool. Definitely cool.((WN))  How did your team go while you were there?Shelley Chaplin: While I was there we... I was there for five years. The first three years we were national champions.((WN))  For five years from 2004 to 2009?Shelley Chaplin: No, I didn't actually go until 2005. So I went in August of 2005. And I finished up in May of 2010. I went to five national championships, and we won three and came runners up in two.((WN))  Wow!Shelley Chaplin: Yeah! We had a good team.((WN))  So you said you played for a club here in Melbourne as well?Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, I play for the Dandenong Rangers here. We've just won two championships in a row. So... hopefully three this year.((WN))  Wow!Shelley Chaplin: Yeah! It's pretty cool.((WN))  That's a pretty amazing record. Shelley Chaplin: Yeah.((WN))  And then of course there's the Gliders as well. You've got the gold... no wait...Shelley Chaplin: No, not the gold! Not yet! Two silvers and a bronze!((WN))  I was sure you'd be saying "I've already got the silver and the bronze. Give me the gold!"Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, that's exactly what I was saying! No, I think we just had a young team and...((WN))  Well, the team's pretty much the same one as in Athens isn't it?Shelley Chaplin: No! There was probably only four players from Athens that were the same. We've got a lot of young players that are just sort of coming into their own in wheelchair basketball, so.((WN))  What I noticed was when I looked over the statistics of basketball over the time you've been playing, the scores have been going up. Shelley Chaplin: Yes. I think that's partly to do with that we changed to a size six ball, so we went to a women's ball. Until 2006 we were still playing with a size seven, which is a men's ball. So we changed that. I think that helped with our statistics, 'cause it's easier for women to handle the ball and stuff like that. I also think there's been a big increase in the professionalism of wheelchair basketball internationally, so you have a lot of people who are training every day for this. Whereas I know leading into Athens not everyone was training full time. But now everyone's a full time athlete.((WN))  So you are a full time athlete?Shelley Chaplin: Yep, I was. Leading into London I was. So from halfway through 2011 till the Paralympics — so, probably a year — I was a full time athlete. So we trained three times a day, five days a week. Play on the weekends.((WN))  So you got a grant from the government?Shelley Chaplin: Yep, the Australian Sports Commission supports us. And so does Basketball Australia obviously. [...]((WN))  That's pretty intense though. Have you taken a break since then?Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, since London I haven't played any basketball. Been doing a lot of different things.((WN))  Like what?Shelley Chaplin: Just gotten into hand cycling actually.((WN))  Oh okay.Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, so myself and one of my team mates, Leanne del Toso, who was in London as well, we have decided to do a fund raiser. So we're going to ride around the perimeter of Fiji. And so it's 550 kilometres in ten days. So I'm going to be on a hand cycle, and Leanne, who can walk, is going to be on a real bike. She has really weak legs. So we're going to do that. Raise some money and awareness for women in sport.((WN))  Wow!Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, it's really exciting.((WN))  When is that?Shelley Chaplin: We go in June. But next month we're going to launch a big fund raising campaign to get together all the money to do it all. But yeah, it's pretty cool. ((WN))  Are you still with the basketball? Are you going to continue with that?Shelley Chaplin: Yep! I do! So two weeks, no less than two weeks, the fourteenth of January, we go to the AIS for our first training camp of the Rio campaign.((WN))  So I might be able to catch you guys again there. Shelley Chaplin: From the fourteenth to the seventeenth.((WN))  It must have been disappointing in London — Let me put it like this: I'm watching the game, and it's "oh no, they're losing" but you don't look like you're losing. You look like you're having the time of your life.  Shelley Chaplin: Yeah! Definitely. I mean, what we play for is to play on the world stage and it is a lot of fun.((WN))  Did you see how many people were there was?  Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, it was insane. In-sane.((WN))  I was staring up at the top and I could not see the top rows. They were completely in darkness.Shelley Chaplin: There was so many people there, and they were all supporting us. It was so much fun. It was the best I've ever done. But yeah, of course it's disappointing, because you don't want to win silver, or lose gold, but...((WN))  The silver's pretty good! Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, being second in the world's pretty good, definitely, but silver's tough.((WN))  It's just that the Gliders have never won. They've never won the World Championship, they've never won at the Paralympics.Shelley Chaplin: We've never won. Yeah, so obviously we wanted to change that. So yeah, definitely disappointing. We did what we were capable of. It wasn't like we underperformed. We didn't play badly. We just weren't quite good enough.((WN))  Yeah.Shelley Chaplin: And the Germans were very good. They worked really hard.((WN))  Really good. Shelley Chaplin: They were very good, so...((WN))  You played pretty well. Shelley Chaplin: We had patches where we didn't play well, but that's basketball.((WN))  The whole team needed to find something and lift, because like... we interviewed one of your team mates, and she we can't expect to win if we're shooting 39 per cent. Then of course you went ahead and won two games shooting 39 per cent, which sort of made a bit of a liar out of her...Shelley Chaplin: Yeah, well our biggest strength was our defence, so if we can play the defence, we can.((WN))  The defence was where you won those games. You blocked them off. Particularly Mexico, they couldn't... Canada was even better. You kept on forcing turnovers, forcing timeouts. That was the defensive game, was the way you won it.   Shelley Chaplin: Absolutely.((WN))  But Germany had a good defensive game as well. It must have been good, playing on your birthday.Shelley Chaplin: It was really cool. The whole team, the whole Australian Paralympic team wished me happy birthday, the whole crowd sang me happy birthday and this sort of stuff. It was pretty special, but once you get into it, it's just another game. I know all the people were talking about the fact that it was my birthday, but it didn't [get to me]. It was fun. It was fun. Not a bad place to have your birthday.((WN))  So how do you compare London with Beijing and Athens?Shelley Chaplin: Well, I think every games gets a little bit better anyway. Like, Beijing was better than Athens and I think London was a lot better than Beijing again. But I think the special thing about London is that it was British, and so they obviously support Australians, but we were just athletes to them, I think. Whereas in Beijing we were still disabled athletes. But in London we were just athletes and they loved our sport and they understood our sport, which was really cool. The crowds... it was amazing.((WN))  We have a lot of statistics on the response to it. Unfortunately, being in London I couldn't see the TV coverage.  Shelley Chaplin: Back here the ABC did a fantastic job with us. Everybody knows about the Paralympics. Everybody saw something.((WN))  Apparently there was extra requests for the Gliders. So more people wanted to see you.  Shelley Chaplin: People like basketball. Basketball is very easy to relate to. Team sports are good to watch. But I think, like I was saying earlier, if you take away the wheelchair, there's nothing to do with disabilities. If an able bodied jumped into a wheelchair, it's exactly the same as us. Whereas an able bodied can't run against someone with blades. You know?((WN))  Yes.  Shelley Chaplin: So I think that's why; it's very relatable, and obviously it's fun to watch.((WN))  It seems be be getting bigger with each set of games. Shelley Chaplin: Definitely.((WN))  I've got figures from Google. London is twice as big. Shelley Chaplin: Yep. Absolutely. The Paralympic movement is exciting because we're all amateur athletes, and we're all doing it because we love the sport. I think, during Beijing, I know in the Australian media they tried to get everyone to look away from our disabilities and look at us just as athletes, but I think in London they were like, here's their disabilities, here's what they are doing athletically, and combining the two, which made for amazing coverage, right? Cause everyone understood our disabilities but our sport as well.((WN))  Some of the things you were doing. The three point shot from a chair.Shelley Chaplin: Yeah.((WN))  And the speed at which you moved at times, in excess of what someone without a chair could do. It's just a fabulous sport. Shelley Chaplin:  I think so!((WN))  Are you're definitely up for Rio as well? Shelley Chaplin: Yep. Definitely. Obviously, it will be my fourth games and I was going to retire after London, but I'm still good enough to do it, and I'm young, I'm only only 28. So, yeah, I think I can play another games in me. The Paralympic movement as I was saying is so exciting right now. I can't even imagine what Rio is going to be like. It's going to be massive. Yeah, I want to be part of it. And representing your country is a big deal.((WN))  Well I look forward to seeing you there. Thanks very much!Shelley Chaplin: No worries!Recently, Wikinews spent time with with Australian Paralympic skier Lincoln Budge who was in Copper Mountain, Colorado for this week's IPC Nor-Am Cup.((Wikinews))  I'm interviewing Lincoln Budge, one of Australia's development team skiers, who is here at the IPC [International Paralympic Committee] Nor-Am Cup and you're not skiing today?Lincoln Budge: Well I skied first run.((WN))  Ooh, a DNF [Did not finish].Lincoln Budge: DNF, so nothing else for the rest of the afternoon now.((WN))  So how have you preformed in the past days? Lincoln Budge: I've done pretty well in the previous days. I've finished every race till now which has been good, I've improved my points on what I've had previously, so I'm progressing slowly and, yeah, it's good.((WN))  What classification are you?Lincoln Budge: LW11.((WN))  Are you shooting for Sochi or are you just kind of developing now with the idea of the next one [Winter Paralympics] in 2018?Lincoln Budge: I'd like to go to Sochi, but realistically it's probably not going to happen, I've only been skiing for three years, so.  Yeah.((WN))  And you're from some town that's really hard to pronounce in Australia.Lincoln Budge: Yes, Yackandandah.((WN))  What state is this in?Lincoln Budge: Victoria, north east Victoria((WN))  So Victoria is the state that produces all the great Australian skiers?Lincoln Budge: Correct, Victoria is the state to be in.((WN))  How long have you been in the development team?Lincoln Budge: Been skiing for almost three years now.((WN))  On the development team or just period?Lincoln Budge: Period but I pretty much got onto the development team [...] days in[?], so all my skiing has been with the team.((WN))  You never considered doing the nordic skiing?Lincoln Budge: No way. [laughs] That's way too much dedication.((WN))  Where do you like to ski and which, like Super G, Slalom, is your favourite?Lincoln Budge: Down hill would be the one I've enjoyed most so far. It's fast, obviously, a speed event, and the whole build-up to it, 's really fun and I enjoy the speed events.((WN))  Where do you like to ski? Are you one of these people likes to come to the US, or do you think Victoria's got the best ski fields in the world?Lincoln Budge: US is pretty good, I've sort of skied quite a few hills.  I've based somewhere different each year so far.  [...]  I don't really have a preferred one.((WN))  Considering how expensive skiing is, do you think you're getting adequate support from everyone to enable you to continue your ski career? Lincoln Budge: Yeah, at the moment I'm getting good support from the team and everyone, which is really good and hopefully financially I can keep doing it into the future.((WN))  As someone watching skiing: can you throw your monoski over your shoulder and transport it that way?Lincoln Budge: I can if I want to but I've got a set of wheels that I clip the rig into so I can push it around more easily than putting it on me shoulder.  I cart skis[?] around on my shoulder, but I've got a set of wheels, just to make it easier.((WN))  Ok, thank you very very much.Yesterday, Wikinews spent time with with Australian Paralympic skier Victoria Pendergast who was in Copper Mountain, Colorado for this week's IPC Nor-Am Cup.((Wikinews))  I'm interviewing Victoria Pendergast who is an Australian female sit skier on the development team.Victoria Pendergast: Yer, that's right.((Wikinews))  How have you been doing here [Copper Mountain] so far?Victoria Pendergast: Yer, its been alright. Like some races not so good, other races I was pretty happy with the results. We've got Winter Park to look forward to, so bit of a warm-up, but, trying to get results.((Wikinews))  Before this [skiing] the other sport you've done is athletics? You competed at that for the games or was that somebody else?Victoria Pendergast: No, that was me. I did it for the school, did shot put and did swimming for a bit.((Wikinews))  Why would someone switch from athletics to be a crazy mono skier?Victoria Pendergast: It was a bit of a crazy sort of events kinda went here with my family and then one thing lead to another and like wanted to give sit skiing a go.((Wikinews))  Australia doesn't have many female sit skiers, are you shooting for Sochi?Victoria Pendergast: It would be nice to get it. It'd be a bit hard to get points to get into it but, you know, if I can get the points to get into Sochi, I've got some [...].((Wikinews))  Cool. Thank you very much.Toronto , Canada —What experiences makes a coach of an international sports team? Wikinews interviewed Tom Kyle, the coach of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, in Toronto for the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship.((Wikinews))  Tell us about yourself. First of all, where were you born?Tom Kyle: I was born in Cooma, in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales. Way back in 1959. Fifteenth of June. Grew up in the Snowy Mountains Scheme with my family. At that stage my father worked for the Snowy scheme. And started playing sport when I was very young. I was a cricketer when I first started. Then about the age of 12, 13 I discovered basketball. Because it had gotten too cold to do all the sports that I wanted to do, and we had a lot of rain one year, and decided then that for a couple of months that we'd have a go at basketball.((WN))  So you took up basketball. When did you decide... did you play for the clubs?Tom Kyle: I played for Cooma. As a 14-year-old I represented them in the under-18s, and then as a 16-year-old I represented them in the senor men's competition. We played in Canberra as a regional district team. At the age of 16 is when I first started coaching. So I started coaching the under-14 rep sides before the age of 16. So I'm coming up to my forty years of coaching.((WN))   So you formed an ambition to be a coach at that time?Tom Kyle: Yeah, I liked the coaching. Well I was dedicated to wanting to be a PE [Physical Education] teacher at school. And in Year 12 I missed out by three marks of getting the scholarship that I needed. I couldn't go to university without a scholarship, and I missed out by three marks of getting in to PE. So I had a choice of either doing a Bachelor of Arts and crossing over after year one, or go back and do Year 12 [again].  Because of my sport in Cooma, because I played every sport there was, and my basketball started to become my love.((WN)) } You still played cricket?Tom Kyle: Still played cricket. Was captain of the ACT [Australian Capital Territory] in cricket at the age of 12. Went on to... potentially I could have gone further but cricket became one of those sports where you spend all weekend, four afternoons a week...((WN))  I know what it's like.Tom Kyle: At that stage I was still an A grade cricketer in Cooma and playing in Canberra, and rugby league and rugby union, had a go at AFL [Australian Football League], soccer. Because in country towns you play everything. Tennis on a Saturday. Cricket or football on a Sunday. That sort of stuff so... And then basketball through the week.((WN))  So you didn't get in to PE, so what did you do?Tom Kyle: I went back and did Year 12 twice. I repeated Year 12, which was great because it allowed me to play more of the sport, which I loved. Didn't really work that much harder but I got the marks that I needed to get the scholarship to Wollongong University. It was the Institute of Education at that stage. So I graduated high school in '78, and started at the Institute of Education Wollongong in '79, as a health and PE — it was a double major. So a dual degree, a four year degree. After two years there they merged the Institute of Education with the University of Wollongong. So I got a degree from the University of Wollongong and I got a degree from the Institute of Education. So I graduated from there in '83. At that stage I was coaching and playing rep basketball in Wollongong in their team underneath the NBL I played state league there for Shellharbour. Still coaching as well with the University, coaching the university sides. It was there that I met up with Doctor Adrian Hurley, who was then one of the Australian coaches, and he actually did some coaching with me when I was at the University, in the gym. So that gave me a good appreciation of coaching and the professionalism of it. He really impressed me and inspired me to do a bit more of it. So in '84 I got married and I moved to Brisbane, and started teaching and looking after the sport of basketball and tennis at Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane.((WN))  You moved to Brisbane for the job?Tom Kyle:  Yes, I was given a job and a house. The job basically entailed looking after their gymnasium and doing some part-time teaching as well as being the basketball convener and tennis convener. I looked after those sports for the private boys school. Churchie is a very big school in Brisbane and so I did that in '84 with my wife at that stage and we lived on the premises. In 1985 I took a team of fifteen boys from Churchie into the United States for a couple of summer camp tours which we do, and I got involved in the Brisbane Bullets team at that stage, getting them moved in to Churchie to train. The Brisbane Bullets was the NBL team in Brisbane at the time. So that got me involved in the Brisbane coaching and junior basketball. I was actually in charge of junior basketball for the Brisbane association. As part of that, I coached at Churchie as well. Looked after some things at the Brisbane Bullets' home games. So that got me well and truly involved in that. And then in '85 was the birth of my first son, and with that came a bit of change of priorities, so then in 1986 I moved back to Sydney. I got offered a job at Harbord Diggers Memorial Club at Harbord, looking after their sports centre. So I saw that as an opportunity to get out of, I suppose, the teaching side of things at that stage didn't appeal to me, the coaching side did, the teaching side and the fact that you had to follow the curriculums, and some of the things you weren't allowed to have fun, to me if you're going to learn you've got to have fun. So that was my sort of enough for the teaching side, I figured I'd go and do something else, and get to keep my coaching alive on the side. So I moved back to Sydney, with my family and my young son. I had a second son in 1987, and I started coaching the Manly-Warringah senior men's and development league teams. We were in the state league at that stage.  So I had both of those teams and I was coaching them, travelling around the north of the state, and competing.  We were fortunate enough we came second the year I was the head coach of the men in the state competition for our area. That gave me a whole new perspective of coaching, because it was now senior men's coaching as well as junior men's. We had people like Ian Davies coming out of the NBL at Sydney and trying out wanting to play with the men's squad. Fair quality in that group. The Dalton boys came out of that program. I didn't coach them, but Brad and Mark Dalton who played for the Kings. That gave me a good couple of years. At that stage I'd changed jobs. I'd actually moved up to Warringah Aquatic Centre in Sydney. Which was at the time the state swimming centre. And I was the director of that for a year. Or eighteen, nineteen months. In that time we held the selection criteria for the 1988 Seoul Olympics swimming. So the national championships and what they call the Olympic selection qualifiers. So we held them at the Warringah Aquatic Centre when I was in charge of it which made it quite an interesting thing, because there I got to see elite sport at its best. Australian swimming. All the swimmers coming through. Lisa Curry has just retired, and I saw her. All the swimmers going to Seoul. That gave me a good appreciation of professional sport, as well as managing sports facilities. So I was there for two years, eighteen months basically. And  we'd made a decision that we wanted to come back to Brisbane.  So moved back to Brisbane in 1989, to take up a job as a marketing officer at the Department of Recreation at Brisbane City Council. That was my full-time job. Meanwhile, again, I got involved in a bit of coaching. My sons were looking at becoming involved, they were going through St Peter Chanel School at The Gap, and that was a feeder school for  Marist Brothers Ashgrove in Brisbane, which was a big Catholic boys' school in Brisbane. So I started to get involved in Marist Brothers Ashgrove basketball program, and I became the convener of basketball as well as the head coach there for about seven or eight years running their program, while my boys, obviously, were going through the school. That was a voluntary thing, because I was still working for the [Brisbane City] Council when I first started. At that stage I'd also quit the council job and started my own IT [Information Technology] company. Which was quite interesting. Because as a sideline I was writing software. At Warringah Aquatic Centre one of the things when I got there they didn't have a computer system, they only had a cash register. And I asked them about statistics and the council didn't have much money, they said, "well, here's an old XT computer", it was an old Wang actually, so it was not quite an XT.((WN))  I know the ones.Tom Kyle: You know the ones?((WN))  Yes.Tom Kyle: And they gave me that, and they said, "Oh, you got no software." One of the guys at council said "we've got an old copy of DataEase. We might give you that," which old an old database programming tool. So I took that and I wrote a point of sale system for the centre. And then we upgraded from DataEase, we went to dBase III and dBase IV. Didn't like dBase IV, it had all these bugs in it, so my system started to crash. So I'd go home at night and write the program, and then come back and put it into the centre during the day so they could collect the statistics I wanted. It was a simple point of sale system, but it was effective, and then we upgraded that to Clipper and I started programming object orientated while I was there, and wrote the whole booking system, we had bookings for the pools, learn-to-swim bookings, point of sale. We actually connected it to an automatic turnstyle with the coin entry so it gave me a whole heap of new skills in IT that I never had before, self-taught, because I'd never done any IT courses, when I went to Brisbane City Council and that didn't work out then I started my own computer company. I took what I'd written in Clipper and decided to rewrite that in Powerbuilder. You've probably heard of it.((WN))  Yes.  Tom Kyle:   So that's when I started my own company. Walked out of the Brisbane City Council. I had an ethical disagreement with my boss, who spent some council money going to a convention at one place and doing some private consultancy, which I didn't agree with Council funds being done like that, so I resigned. Probably the best move of my business life. It then allowed me then to become an entrepreneur of my own, so I wrote my own software, and started selling a leisure package which basically managed leisure centres around the country. And I had the AIS [Australian Institute of Sport]  as one of my clients.((WN))  Oh!Tom Kyle:    Yes, they have a turnstyle entry system and learn-to-swim booking system and they were using it for many years. Had people all over the country. I ended up employing ten people in my company, which was quite good, right through to, I suppose, 1997?, somewhere in there. And I was still coaching full time, well, not full time, but, voluntary, for about 35 hours a week at Ashgrove at the time, as well as doing, I did the Brisbane under-14 rep side as well, so that gave me a good appreciation of rep basketball. So I'd been coaching a lot of school basketball in that time. And then in 2000 I decided to give that away and went to work for Jupiters Casino.  Bit of a change. I started as a business analyst and ended up as a product development manager. I was doing that, I was going through a divorce, still coaching at Ashgrove, I had been at Ashgrove now from 1992 through to 2003.  I had been coaching full time as the head coach, coordinator of all the coaches and convener of the sport for the school. We won our competitions a number of times. We went to the state schools competition as a team there one year. Which we did quite well. Didn't win it but, did quite well. In 2003 my boys had finished at school and I'd got a divorce at that stage. Been offered another opportunity to go to Villanova College, which was a competing school across the other side of the river. So I started head coaching there for five years. It was there where I started to get into wheelchair basketball. It is an interesting story, because at that stage I'd moved on from Jupiters Casino. I'd actually started working for various companies, and I ended up with Suncorp Metway as a project manager. Got out of my own company and decided to earn more money as a consultant. [evil laugh]((WN))  A common thing.Tom Kyle:     But it was in Suncorp Metway where I got into wheelchair basketball.((WN))   How does that happen?Tom Kyle:    At the time I was spending about 35 to 40 hours a week at Villanova College, coaching their program and my new wife, Jane, whom you've met...((WN))  Who is now the [Gliders'] team manager.Tom Kyle:   Correct. She was left out a little bit because I'd be with the guys for many many hours. We did lot of good things together because I had a holistic approach to basketball. It's not about just playing the game, it's about being better individuals, putting back into your community and treating people the right way, so we used to do a lot of team building and [...] cause you're getting young men at these schools, trying to get them to become young adults. And she saw what we were doing one time, went to an awards dinner, and she was basically gobsmacked by what relationship we had with these boys. How well mannered they were and what influence we had. How these boys spoke of the impact on their lives. It was where she said to me, "I really want to get involved in that. I want to be part of that side of your life." And I said, "Okay, we might go out and volunteer." We put our names down at Sporting Wheelies, the disabled association at the time, to volunteer in disabled sports. Didn't hear anything for about four months, so I thought, oh well, they obviously didn't want me. One of my colleagues at work came to me and he said "Tom, you coach wheelchair basketball?" I said, "yeah, I do." And he said, "Well, my son's in a wheelchair, and his team's looking for a coach. Would you be interested?" And I thought about it. And I said, "Well, coaching for about 35 hours a week over here at Villanova School. I don't think my wife will allow me to coach another 20 hours somewhere else, but give me the information and I'll see what we can do."  He gave me the forms. I took the forms home. It was actually the Brisbane Spinning Bullets, at that stage, which was the National [Wheelchair Basketball] League team for Queensland. They were looking for coaching staff. I took the forms home, which was a head coach role, an assistant head coach role, and a manager role. I left them on the bench, my wife Jane took a look at it and said, "Hey! They're looking for a manager! If I'd be the manager, you could be the head coach, it's something we could do it together. We always said we'd do something together, and this is an opportunity." I said, "Okay, if you want to do that. I'm still not going to drop my Villanova commitments, I'm going to keep that going. So that was in the beginning of 2008.  So we signed up and lo and behold, I got the appointment as the head coach and she got the appointment as the manager. So it was something we started to share. Turned up at the first training session and met Adrian King and Tige Simmonds, Rollers, Australian players... I'd actually heard of Adrian because we'd had a young boy at Ashgrove called Sam Hodge. He was in a chair and he brought Adrian in for a demonstration one day. I was quite impressed by the way he spoke, and cared about the kids.  So to me it was like an eye-opener. So I started coaching that year, started in January–February, and obviously it was leading in to the Paralympics in 2008, Beijing. And coaching the team, I started coaching the national League, a completely different came, the thing I liked about it is wheelchair basketball is like the old-school basketball, screen and roll basketball. You can't get anywhere unless somebody helps you get there. It's not one-on-one like the able-bodied game today. So that was really up my alley, and I really enjoyed that. I applied a couple of things the boys hadn't actually seen, and as it turns out, I ended up coaching against the [Perth] Wheelcats in a competition round. And I didn't at the time know, that the guy on the other bench  was Ben Ettridge, the head coach for the Rollers. And after the weekend we shook hands and he said, "I really like what you do, what you're trying to do with this group. And he said I like the way you coach and your style. Would you be interested if the opportunity came up to come down to Canberra and participate in a camp. He said "I can't pay you to be there, but if you want to come along..." I said "Absolutely. I'll be there." So about three or four weeks later I get a phone call from Ben and he said "We've got a camp coming up in February, would you like to come in?" I said: "Yep, absolutely", so I went and flew myself down there and attended the camp. Had a great time getting to know the Rollers, and all of that, and I just applied what I knew about basketball, which wasn't much about wheelchair, but a lot about basketball, ball movement and timing. And I think he liked what he saw. The two of us got on well. And out of that camp they were getting the team prepared to go to Manchester. They were going into Varese first, Manchester for the British Telecom Paralympic Cup that they have in May, which is an event that they do prior to some of these major events. That was 2009, my mistake, after Beijing; so the camp was after Beijing as well. So I was sitting at Suncorp Metway running a big CRM program at the time, because they had just merged with Promina Insurances, so they'd just acquired all these companies like AAMI, Vero and all those companies, so we had all of these disparate companies and we were trying to get a single view of the customer, so I was running a major IT project to do that. And I get a phone call from Ben on the Friday, and he said "Look, Tom, we're going to Varese in the May, and we're going on to Manchester." I said, "I know". And he said, "Craig Friday, my assistant coach, can't make it. Got work commitments." I said: "Oh, that's no good." And he said: "Would you be interested in going?"  And I said "Well, when's that?" And he said: "Monday week."  And this was on the Friday. And I said: "Look, I'm very interested, but let me check with my boss, because I [am] running a big IT project." So I went to my boss on the Friday and I said "Look, I am very keen to do this Australian opportunity. Two weeks away. You okay if I take two weeks off?" And he said. "Oh, let me think about it." The Monday was a public holiday, so I couldn't talk to him then.  And I said "Well, I need to know, because it's Monday week, and I need to let him know." And he said, "I'll let you know Tuesday morning." So I sort of thought about it over the weekend, and I rang Ben on the Sunday night I think it was, and I said "I'm in!" He said: "Are you okay with work?"  I said: "Don't worry about that, I'll sort it out." Anyway, walked into work on Tuesday morning and the boss said... and I said I just to put it on the table: I'm going. You need to decide whether you want me to come back." And he said: "What?!" And I said, "Well, I love my basketball. My basketball has been my life for many years, many, many hours. Here's an opportunity to travel with an Australian side. I'm telling you that I'm taking the opportunity, and you need to determine whether you want me back. " And he said: "Really?" And I said: "Yeah. Yeah. That's it." And he said: "Well, I'll have to think about that." And I said, "well you think about it but I've already told the Australian coach I'm going. It's a decision for you whether you want me back. If you don't, that's fine, I don't have a problem." So on the Wednesday he came back and said: "We're not going to allow you to go." I said: "Well, I'm going. So here's my resignation." He says: "You'd really do that?" And I said: "Absolutely."  And I resigned. So on the Friday I finished up, and got on a plane on Monday, and headed to Varese as Ben's assistant on the tour. Got to spend a bit more time with Tige Simmonds and Adrian and Justin and Brad and Shaun and all the boys and had a fabulous time. Learnt a lot. And then we went on to Manchester and learnt even more, and I think Ben was quite happy with what I'd done. With my technical background I took over all the video analysis stuff and did all that recording myself. We didn't really want any hiccups so he was pretty happy with that. So after that Ben asked me if I would be interested in becoming an assistant coach with the under-23s, because the then-coach was Mark Walker and Ben Osborne was his assistant but he wanted somebody else who, as he put it, he could trust, in that group, because a number of his developing players were in that group. So that meant that I had some camps to do in June when I came back, and then in July, think it was July, 2009, went to England and Paris with the under-23s for the world championships. That was my first foray as an assistant coach officially with the Australian team, and I was the assistant coach. It was a combined team at that stage, boys and girls. Cobi Crispin was on that tour. Amber Merritt was on that tour. Adam Deans was on that tour, Colin Smith, Kim Robbins, John McPhail, all of those. There was a number of junior Rollers coming through that group. Bill Latham was on that tour. He really appreciated what I'd done there, and when Craig Friday said that he was having a family and couldn't commit to the next year in 2010 which was the world championship year, Ben asked me to join the program. So that's how I started. So in 2010 I attended my first official world championships with the Rollers, and we won.((WN))  Yes!Tom Kyle: So that was an amazing experience to go on that tour and to see what a championship team looks like under the competition of that ilk. And I was then the assistant coach basically right through to London. After London, Ben was quite happy for me to continue. I was doing it voluntarily. By this stage, 2011, I'd given up all the Villanova stuff so I concentrated just on the wheelchair and my Queensland group. And I started to build the Queensland junior program, which featured Tom O'Neill-Thorne, Jordon Bartley, Bailey Rowland, all of those sort of players. You probably don't know too many of them, but,((WN))  No.Tom Kyle:   They're all the up-and-comers. And three of those were in last year's, 2013 under-23s team. So in 2012 obviously we went to Varese then on to London for the Paras. Won silver in that. When I came back, Ben asked me to do the under-23s as the head coach, and asked me who I wanted as my assistant, so in the December, we, David Gould and I...((WN))  So you selected David as your assistant?Tom Kyle: Yes! Yes! Yes! I had a lot of dealings with David, seeing him with the Gliders. Liked what I saw. Plus I'd also seen him with the Adelaide Thunder. He was coaching them for a while, and I really liked the way he worked with kids. He'd also done a camp with the under-23s in 2012 because I couldn't attend, himself and Sonia Taylor. What was Sonia's previous name before she married Nick Taylor? [...] Anyway, they did a development camp in January 2012 with the under-23s group because I couldn't attend. Good feedback coming back from that. In the April, the Rollers had gone off to Verase, and there was an opportunity to go to Dubai with the under-23/25 age group. So David and Sonia took them to Dubai and did a good job with them, a really great job with them. So the job for the 23s came up in November 2012. I applied. Got the job. And then was asked who I would want as my assistants, and Ben told me who the other applicants were and I told him, yep, happy with both of those.  David became my first assistant [...] So we took the under-23s group in December. Had a couple of camps in the first part of 2013, getting ready for the world championships in Turkey in September. At that stage we got to about June, and the head coach for the Gliders came up as a full time position.((WN))  They hadn't had a full-time coach before. Tom Kyle: No, it was all voluntary so John Triscari was, well, not voluntary; was getting a little bit of money, not a great deal.((WN))  But it wasn't a full time job.Tom Kyle: No. So Basketball Australia decided that they needed a full-time coach, which was a big investment for them, and they thought this was the next step for the Gliders. So at the end of May, I remember talking to my wife, because at that stage she'd been on the Gliders' tour as a replacement manager for Marion Stewart. Marion couldn't go on a certain tour, to Manchester, so Jane filled in. And they talked to her about possibly becoming the manager of the Gliders moving forward if Marion ever wanted to retire. So in the May when the job came up I looked at it and went, well, can't, it's a conflict of interest, because if I put my name up, potentially Jane misses out on being the manager. Also I thought if Ben really wants me to go for it he would have asked me. He hasn't mentioned it, so, I didn't apply at first look at it. And then I was just happening to talk to Ben on the side about something else and he asked me if I had put in for the Gliders and I said no I hadn't. And he asked me why, and I told him if you would have I probably would have, and with Jane. And he said Jane shouldn't be an issue, and he said I want you to go for it. I said, well, if you're happy, because I'm loyal to whoever I'm with, I said I'm loyal to you Ben, and at the end of the day I'd stay with the Rollers if you want me to stay with the Rollers. Because for me I enjoy doing whatever I'm doing, and I love the program. He said no, no, I want you to put in for it.  So then I had to discuss it with the wife because it meant initially that would want us to move to Sydney. That was still in the cards. So Jane and I had a talk about that. And I said, look, I'd go for it on the condition that it didn't interfere with Jane's opportunity to become the manager. So I put in my resume, I got an interview, and in the interview I went to Sydney, and I put all the cards on the table. I said look, the bottom line is that if it's going to jeopardize Jane's chances of being the  manager, I will opt out.  And at that stage they said no, they see that as possibly a positive, rather than a negative. So I said okay, if that's the case. It's funny. On the day we had the interview I ran in David Gould back in the airport, because he'd obviously had his interview. And we were talking and I said: "Oh, I didn't think you were going for it." And he  said, yeah, I wasn't, because I don't really want to move to Sydney. And I said, well that was one of the other reasons I did put in for it, because if you didn't get it I wanted to make sure someone who was passionate about the Gliders to get it. And there's a couple on the list who may be passionate, but I wasn't sure. I knew you were, because we'd talked about it at the under-23s. So we had a chat there and I said, if he gets it, he'd put me as an assistant and if I get it I'd put him as an assistant. Because we'd worked so well with the under-23s together as a unit. And we do. We work very well together. We think alike, we both like to play the game etc. So it turns out in June I got a phone call from Steve Nick at that stage and got offered the job with the Gliders. So I started on the first of July full time with the Gliders, but I still had the under-23s to get through to September, so we had a camp, our first camp in July with the Gliders. Went to a national league round in Sydney and then we bused them down to Canberra for a camp. And that was quite an interesting camp because there were a lot of tears, a lot of emotion. It was the first camp since London. It was eighteen months, nearly two years since London [editor's note: about ten months] and nobody had really contacted them. They've been after a silver medal, left. Just left. They were waiting for someone to be appointed and no one had been in touch. And all that sort of stuff. So we went through a whole cleansing exercise there to try and understand what they were going through. And I felt for the girls at that stage. 'Cause they put a lot of work into being the Gliders, and they do all the time. But they felt disconnected. So that was an emotional camp, but as I said to David at the time, we've got to build this program. Since then we've been working through. We did the under-23 worlds with the junior boys in September in Turkey. They earned third, a bronze medal. Could have potentially played for gold, but just couldn't get it going in the semifinal. And then we came back to the Gliders and got ready for Bangkok. Bangkok was our first tour with the Gliders, which was a huge success. Because we got some confidence in the group, and that's one of the things we're working on is building their confidence and a belief in themselves. Being able to put things together when it really counts. So that was one of our goals. So Bangkok was our first tour, and I think we achieved a lot there. Got a good team bonding happening there. We've since then been to Osaka in February, which was another good outing for the girls. Five day experience with playing five games against the Japanese.  That was good. Then in March we brought them here [Canada] for a tournament with the Netherlands, Canada and Japan, and then down to the United States for a four game series against the US. And again, that was a good learning experience. Then back home for a month and then we got to go to Europe, where we played in Frankfurt for the four games, and to Papendal with the Netherlands team. We played three games there before we came here.((WN))  So that's a pretty detailed preparation.Tom Kyle: Yeah, it's been good. Pretty detailed. It's been good though. We're still growing as a group. We're a lot stronger than we ever have been, I think, mentally. But we're now starting to get to the real honesty phase, where we can tell each other what we need to tell each other to get the job done. That's the breakthrough we've made in the last month. Whereas in the past I think we've been afraid to offend people with what we say. So now we're just saying it and getting on with it. And we're seeing some real wins in that space.((WN))  Thank you!Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center, Bangkok —Wikinews interviewed Caitlin de Wit, of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders. The Gliders are in Bangkok, Thailand, for the Asia–Oceania Zone Wheelchair Basketball Championships, which are being held at the Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center. Wikinews caught up with her on Tuesday, before the Gliders' match against China.((Wikinews))  Where were you born?Caitlin de Wit: In Cape Town in South Africa.((WN))  When did you come to Australia?Caitlin de Wit: When I was six.((WN))  And then you moved to whereabouts?Caitlin de Wit: And I grew up on the Central Coast.((WN))  A I believe you had a horse riding accident?Caitlin de Wit: I had a horse riding accident in Wagga.((WN))  What sort of horse riding were you doing?Caitlin de Wit: I was just riding with friends. We were just like out on a ride.((WN))  And you fell off.Caitlin de Wit: Yeah.((WN))  And you were at uni[versity] at the time?Caitlin de Wit: Yeah, I was at uni in Wagga and that's where I had my accident. And I went obviously to hospital for a little while and rehab and then I moved back to Wagga to finish my degree.((WN))  What was the degree in? Caitlin de Wit: Equine studies. Horses.((WN))  And you played sport before then?Caitlin de Wit: I ran a little bit, and I rode horses. They were my sports. And then in my first year of uni I started soccer. That was my first team sport that I played.((WN))  So what made you take up basketball?Caitlin de Wit: I suppose when I lefty hospital I was a bit bored. I wanted something to do. Keep me fit and occupied.  So.((WN))  So which team did you join?Caitlin de Wit: I just joined the local Wagga team.((WN))  There's a local Wagga team?Caitlin de Wit: Yeah, there was. I don't know if its still there. And then I joined... and then Sarah Stewart saw me at a juniors' camp. And I joined what was then the Hills Hornets in the women's league.((WN))  So you played with the Hills Hornets. Caitlin de Wit: mmm hmm((WN))  And when was that?Caitlin de Wit: My first season was 2007.((WN))  Did they win the championships that year?Caitlin de Wit: Yeah.((WN))  They won for a series of years straight...Caitlin de Wit: They won straight up until 2011. We had one win as the Flames.((WN))  And you joined the junior Australian women's team?Caitlin de Wit: Yeah, the under 25s.((WN))  And where did you go with them?Caitlin de Wit: We went to Canada for the under 25 World Championships.((WN))  When was that?Caitlin de Wit: 2011.((WN))  And you're still playing with the Flames in Sydney. And you played for the Gliders at the Osaka Cup?Caitlin de Wit: Yep.((WN))  And that was in January this year?Caitlin de Wit: Yeah.  February maybe?  January-February?((WN))  And that was your first trip overseas with the senior sideCaitlin de Wit: Yes.((WN))  And now this is therefore your second trip with the Gliders?Caitlin de Wit: Yes.((WN))  Been overseas much before then?Caitlin de Wit: Yeah. Been overseas a little bit. Not with basketball.((WN))  Being from South Africa.Caitlin de Wit: Yeah. My family traveled a little bit as a kid, so... yeah.((WN))  Have you played anywhere overseas with any other teams?Caitlin de Wit: No.((WN))  So how are you enjoying it here in Bangkok?Caitlin de Wit: Good. It's been a really great experience.((WN))  I keep worrying about whether they are going to blockade the airport when we need to get out of here.Caitlin de Wit: Yeah, it should be fine.((WN))  Okay, so enjoy it!Caitlin de Wit: Yeah!Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center, Bangkok —Wikinews interviewed Georgia Inglis, of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders. The Gliders are in Bangkok, Thailand, for the Asia-Oceania Zone Wheelchair Basketball Championships, which are being held at the Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center. They are hoping to qualify for the World Championships, which are being held in Toronto, Canada, in June next year. Inglis is one of two new players in the team. Wikinews caught up with her before the Gliders' match against China.((Wikinews))  Where were you born?Georgia Inglis: In Perth.((WN))  Perth!Georgia Inglis: Yep.((WN))  According to the [draft Wikipedia] article, it says that you had an accident involving a ride-on lawn mower?Georgia Inglis: Yep. That's true.((WN))  Really? What happened?Georgia Inglis: The boy just didn't see me, so he ran over.((WN))  And how old were you?Georgia Inglis: I was ten.((WN))  It says also that you were a tennis player and a swimmer.Georgia Inglis: Yep.((WN))  Which sports did you get involved in? You were playing sports before your accident?Georgia Inglis: I did tennis before my accident, and I did tennis after my accident and I did swimming after my accident.((WN))  And it says that you were a really good tennis player and swimmer.Georgia Inglis: Um, no, not that good. I was a little bit competitive, but that's about it.((WN))  So what made you take up basketball?Georgia Inglis: I just enjoyed the team sport more. Yes, enjoyed it a lot more.((WN))  So when did you start playing?Georgia Inglis: Three or four years ago, I think it was.((WN))  A you joined the local team there?Georgia Inglis: The juniors, yeah. Then I trained with the Western Stars. And I got on the team.((WN))  When was that, about 2010 or 2011?Georgia Inglis: The first Kevin King cup. Whenever that was.((WN))  I'll find outGeorgia Inglis: It was in Sydney.((WN))  You've been playing with them for three or four years. Georgia Inglis: Yep.((WN))  And you were selected for the Osaka Cup earlier this year. Georgia Inglis: Yep.((WN))  Which was your first overseas trip with the Gliders.Georgia Inglis: With the Gliders, yep.((WN))  You've been overseas with the under 23?Georgia Inglis: Yep.((WN))  Where'd you go?Georgia Inglis: Canada! Toronto.((WN))  Okay!Georgia Inglis: Yep.((WN))  I saw you play in the [WNWBL] games. You were particularly impressive in that final. Georgia Inglis: The Grand Final?((WN))  The Grand Final. You guys won.Georgia Inglis: Yeah.((WN))  You were really good.Georgia Inglis: Oh, thank you.((WN))  And so you were at a couple of training camps, and then you were selected for this.Georgia Inglis: Yep.((WN))  And so how has it been?Georgia Inglis: Yeah, it's been really good. I loved it. Really good. Really enjoyed it.((WN))  And Bangkok? What do you think about it?Georgia Inglis: It's an interesting place.((WN))  Bit different?Georgia Inglis: Very different to Australia.((WN))  Have you been overseas only to Toronto, or have you been elsewhere?Georgia Inglis: No, I went to Italy and trained over there for three months.((WN))  When was that?Georgia Inglis: Last year. And I played for... well I didn't really play, but I trained with a team in Sardinia.((WN))  So you were part of the team? Georgia Inglis: Yeah, but I didn't really play, just trained.((WN))  Some other players have...Georgia Inglis: Yeah, Luke Pople and Alan Deans. We all went over there.((WN))  Anything else you'd like to say?Georgia Inglis: Can't really think of anything.((WN))  Okay! No worries! Thank you!Preston, Victoria, Australia —On Saturday, Wikinews interviewed Tina McKenzie, a former member of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders. McKenzie, a silver and bronze Paralympic medalist in wheelchair basketball, retired from the game after the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Wikinews caught up with her in a cafe in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Preston. Tina McKenzie: [The Spitfire Tournament in Canada] was a really good tournament actually. It was a tournament that I wish we'd actually gone back to more often.((Wikinews))  Who plays in that one?Tina McKenzie: It's quite a large Canadian tournament, and so we went as the Gliders team. So we were trying to get as many international games as possible. 'Cause that's one of our problems really, to compete. It costs us so much money to for us to travel overseas and to compete internationally. And so we can compete against each other all the time within Australia but we really need to be able to...((WN))  It's not the same.Tina McKenzie: No, it's really not, so it's really important to be able to get as a many international trips throughout the year to continue our improvement. Also see where all the other teams are at as well. But yes, Spitfire was good. We took quite a few new girls over there back then in 2005, leading into the World Cup in the Netherlands.((WN))  Was that the one where you were the captain of the team, in 2005? Or was that a later one?Tina McKenzie: No, I captained in 2010. So 2009, 2010 World Cup. And then I had a bit of some time off in 2011.((WN))  The Gliders have never won the World Championship.Tina McKenzie: We always seem to have just a little bit of a chill out at the World Cup. I don't know why. It's really strange occurrence, over the years. 2002 World Cup, we won bronze. Then in 2006 we ended up fourth. It was one of the worst World Cups we've played actually. And then in 2010 we just... I don't know what happened. We just didn't play as well as we thought we would. Came fourth. But you know what? Fired us up for the actual Paralympics. So the World Cup is... it's good to be able to do well at the World Cup, to be placed, but it also means that you get a really good opportunity to know where you're at in that two year gap between the Paralympics. So you can come back home and revisit what you need to do and, you know, where the team's at. And all that sort of stuff.((WN))  Unfortunately, they are talking about moving it so it will be on the year before the Paralympics.Tina McKenzie: Oh really.((WN))  The competition from the [FIFA] World Cup and all.Tina McKenzie: Right. Well, that would be sad.((WN))  But anyway, it is on next year, in June. In Toronto, and they are playing at the Maple Leaf Gardens? Tina McKenzie: Okay. I don't know where that is.((WN))  I don't know either!Tina McKenzie: (laughs)((WN))  We'll find it. The team in Bangkok was pretty similar. There's two — yourself and Amanda Carter — who have retired. Katie Hill wasn't selected, but they had Kathleen O'Kelly-Kennedy back, so there was ten old players and only two new ones. Tina McKenzie: Which is a good thing for the team. The new ones would have been Georgia [Inglis] and?((WN))  Caitlin de Wit.Tina McKenzie: Yeah... Shelley Cronau didn't get in?((WN))  No, she's missed out again.Tina McKenzie: Interesting.((WN))  That doesn't mean that she won't make the team... Tina McKenzie: You never know.((WN))  You never know until they finally announce it.Tina McKenzie: You never know what happens. Injuries happen leading into... all types of things and so... you never know what the selection is like.((WN))  They said to me that they expected a couple of people to get sick in Bangkok. And they did. Tina McKenzie: It's pretty usual, yeah.((WN))  They sort of budgeted for three players each from the men's and women's teams to be sick.Tina McKenzie: Oh really? And that worked out?((WN))  Yeah. I sort of took to counting the Gliders like sheep so I knew "Okay, we've only go ten, so who's missing?" Tina McKenzie: I heard Shelley got sick.((WN))  She was sick the whole time. And Caitlin and Georgia were a bit off as well. Tina McKenzie: It's tough if you haven't been to Asian countries as well, competing and...((WN))  The change of diet affects some people.Tina McKenzie: Yeah. I remember when we went to Korea and...((WN))  When was that?Tina McKenzie: Korea would have been qualifiers in two thousand and... just before China, so that would have been...((WN))  2007 or 2008?Tina McKenzie: Yeah, 2007. Maybe late, no, it might have been early 2007. It was a qualifier for — Beijing, I think actually. Anyway, we went and played China, China and Japan. And it was a really tough tournament on some of our really new girls. They really struggled with the food. They struggled with the environment that we were in. It wasn't a clean as what they normally exist in. A lot of them were very grumpy. (laughs) It's really hard when you're so used to being in such a routine, and you know what you want to eat, and you're into a tournament and all of a sudden your stomach or your body can't take the food and you're just living off rice, and that's not great for anyone.((WN))  Yeah, well, the men are going to Seoul for their world championship, while the women go to Toronto. And of course the next Paralympics is in Rio.Tina McKenzie: Yeah, I know.((WN))  It will be a very different climate and very different food.Tina McKenzie: We all learn to adjust. I have over the years. I've been a vegetarian for the last thirteen years. Twelve years maybe. So you learn to actually take food with you. And you learn to adjust, knowing what environment you're going in to, and what works for you. I have often carried around cans of red kidney beans. I know that I can put that in lettuce or in salad and get through with a bit of protein. And you know Sarah Stewart does a terrific job being a vegan, and managing the different areas and countries that we've been in to. Germany, for example, is highly dependent on the meat side of food, and I'm pretty sure I remember in Germany I lived on pasta and spaghetti. Tomato sauce. Yeah, that was it. (laughs) That's alright. You just learn. I think its really hard for the new girls that come in to the team. It's so overwhelming at the best of times anyway, and their nerves are really quite wracked I'd say, and that different travel environment is really hard. So I think the more experience they can get in traveling and playing internationally, the better off they'll be for Rio.((WN))  One of the things that struck me about the Australian team — I hadn't seen the Gliders before London. It was an amazing experience seeing you guys come out on the court for the first time at the Marshmallow...Tina McKenzie: (laughs)((WN))  It was probably all old hat to you guys. You'd been practicing for months. Certainly since Sydney in July.Tina McKenzie: It was pretty amazing, yeah. I think it doesn't really matter how many Paralympics you actually do, being able to come out on that court, wherever it is, it's never dull. It's always an amazing experience, and you feel quite honored, and really proud to be there and it still gives you a tingle in your stomach. It's not like "oh, off I go. Bored of this."((WN))  Especially that last night there at the North Greenwich Arena. There were thirteen thousand people there. They opened up some extra parts of the stadium. I could not even see the top rows. They were in darkness.Tina McKenzie: It's an amazing sport to come and watch, and its an amazing sport to play. It's a good spectator sport I think. People should come and see especially the girls playing. It's quite tough. And I was talking to someone yesterday and it was like "Oh I don't know how you play that! You know, it's so rough. You must get so hurt." It's great! Excellent, you know? Brilliant game that teaches you lots of strategies. And you can actually take all those strategies off the court and into your life as well. So it teaches you a lot of discipline, a lot of structure and... it's a big thing. It's not just about being on the court and throwing a ball around.((WN))  When I saw you last you were in Sydney and you said you were moving down to Melbourne. Why was that?Tina McKenzie: To move to Melbourne? My mum's down here. And I lived here for sixteen years or something.((WN))  I know you lived here for a long time, but you moved up to Sydney. Did your teacher's degree up there. Tina McKenzie: I moved to Sydney to go to uni, and Macquarie University were amazing in the support that they actually gave me. Being able to study and play basketball internationally, the scholarship really helped me out. And you know, it wasn't just about the scholarship. It was.. Deidre Anderson was incredible. She's actually from Melbourne as well, but her support emotionally and "How are you doing?" when she'd run into you and was always very good at reading people... where they're at. She totally understands at the levels of playing at national level and international level and so it wasn't just about Macquarie supporting me financially, it was about them supporting me the whole way through. And that was how I got through my degree, and was able to play at that level for such a long time.((WN))  And you like teaching?Tina McKenzie: Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do. I'm still waiting on my transfer at the moment from New South Wales to Victoria, but teaching's good. It's really nice to be able to spend some time with kids and I think its really important for kids to be actually around people with disabilities to actually normalize us a little bit and not be so profound about meeting someone that looks a little bit different. And if I can do that at a young age in primary school and let them see that life's pretty normal for me, then I think that's a really important lesson.((WN))  You retired just after the Paralympics.Tina McKenzie: I did. Yeah. Actually, it took me quite a long time to decide to do that. I actually traveled after London. So I backpacked around... I went to the USA and then to Europe. And I spent a lot of time traveling and seeing amazing new things, and spending time by myself, and reflecting on... So yes, I got to spend quite a bit of time reflecting on my career and where I wanted to go.((WN))  Your basketball career or your teaching career? Tina McKenzie: All the above. Yeah. Everything realistically. And I think it was a really important time for me to sort of decide sort of where I wanted to go in myself. I'd spent sixteen years with the Gliders. So that's a long time to be around the Gliders apparently.((WN))  When did you join them for the first time?Tina McKenzie: I think it was '89? No, no, no, sorry, no, no, no, '98. We'll say 1998. Yeah, 1998 was my first tournament, against USA. So we played USA up in New South Wales in the Energy Australia tour. So we traveled the coast. Played up at Terrigal. It was a pretty amazing experience, being my first time playing for Australia and it was just a friendly competition so... Long time ago. And that was leading into 2000, into the big Sydney Olympics. That was the beginning of an amazing journey realistically. But going back to why I retired, or thinking about retiring, I think when I came home I decided to spend a little bit more time with mum. Cause we'd actually lost my dad. He passed away two years ago. He got really sick after I came back from World Cup, in 2011, late 2010, he was really unwell, so I spent a lot of time down here. I actually had a couple of months off from the Gliders because I needed to deal with the family. And I think that it was really good to be able to get back and get on the team and... I love playing basketball but after being away, and I've done three Paralympics, I've been up for four campaigns, I think its time now to actually take a step backwards and... Well not backwards... take a step out of it and spend quality time with mum and quality time with people that have supported me throughout the years of me not being around home but floating back in and floating out again and its a really... it's a nice time for me to be able to also take on my teaching career and trying to teach and train and work full time is really hard work and I think its also time for quite a few of the new girls to actually step up and we've got quite a few... You've got Caitlin, and you've got Katie and you've got Shelley and Georgia. There's quite a few nice girls coming through that will fit really well into the team and it's a great opportunity for me to go. It's my time now. See where they go with that, and retire from the Gliders. It was a hard decision. Not an easy decision to retire. I definitely miss it. But I think now I'd rather focus on maybe helping out at the foundation level of starting recruitment and building up a recruiting side in Melbourne and getting new girls to come along and play basketball. People with... doesn't even have to be girls but just trying to re-feed our foundation level of basketball, and if I can do that now I think that's still giving towards the Gliders and Rollers eventually. That would be really nice. Just about re-focusing. I don't want to completely leave basketball. I'd still like to be part of it. Looking to the development side of things and maybe have a little bit more input in that area would be really nice though. Give back the skills I've been taught over the years and be a bit of an educator in that area I think would be nice. It's really hard when you're at that international level to... you're so time poor that it's really hard to be able to focus on all that recruitment and be able to give out skill days when you're actually trying to focus on improving yourself. So now I've got that time that I could actually do that. Be a little bit more involved in mentoring maybe, something like that. Yeah, that's what I'd like to do.((WN))  That would be good.Tina McKenzie: Yeah! That would be great, actually. So I've just been put on the board of Disability Sport and Recreation, which is the old Wheelchair Sports Victoria. So that's been a nice beginning move. Seeing where all the sports are at, and what we're actually facilitating in Victoria, considering I've been away from Victoria for so long. It's nice to know where they're all at.((WN))  Where are they all at?Tina McKenzie: Yeah, dunno. They're not very far at all. Victoria... I think Victoria is really struggling in the basketball world. Yeah, I think there's a bit of a struggle. Back in the day... back in those old times, where Victoria would be running local comps. We'd have an A grade and a B grade on a Thursday night, and we'd have twelve teams in A grade and B grade playing wheelchair basketball. That's a huge amount of people playing and when you started in B grade you'd be hoping that you came around and someone from A grade would ask you to come and play. So it was a really nice way to build your basketball skills up and get to know that community. And I think its really important to have a community, people that you actually feel comfortable and safe around. I don't want to say it's a community of disabled people. It's actually...((WN))  It's not really because...Tina McKenzie: Well, it's not. The community's massive. It's not just someone being in a chair. You've got your referees, you've got people that are coming along to support you. And it's a beautiful community. I always remember Liesl calling it a family, and it's like a family so... and it's not just Australia-based. It's international. It's quite incredible. It's really lovely. But it's about providing that community for new players to come through. And you know, not every player that comes through to play basketball wants to be a Paralympian. So its about actually providing sport, opportunities for people to be physically active. And if they do want to compete for Australia and they're good enough, well then we support that. But I think it's really hard in the female side of things. There's not as many females with a disability.((WN))  Yeah, they kept on pointing that out...Tina McKenzie: It's really hard, but I think one of the other things is that we also need to be able to get the sport out there into the general community. And it's not just about having a disability, it's about coming along and playing with your mate that might be classifiable or an ex-basketball player. Like I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and she's six foot two...((WN))  Sounds like a basketball player already.Tina McKenzie: She's been a basketball player, an AB basketball player for years. Grew up playing over in Adelaide, and her knee is so bad that she can't run anymore, and she can't cycle, but yet wants to be physically active, and I'm like "Oooh, you can come along and play wheelchair basketball" and she's like "I didn't even think that I could do that!" So it's about promoting. It not that you actually have to be full time in the chair, or being someone  with an amputation or other congenitals like a spinal disability, it's wear and tear on people's bodies and such.((WN))  Something I noticed in the crowd in London. People seemed to think that they were in the chair all the time and were surprised when most of the Rollers got up out of their chairs at the end of the game.Tina McKenzie: Yeah.((WN))  Disability is a very complicated thing. Tina McKenzie: It is, yeah.((WN))  I was surprised myself at people who were always in a chair, but yet can wiggle their toes.  Tina McKenzie: Yeah, it's the preconceived thing, like if you see someone in a chair, a lot of people just think that nothing works, but in hindsight there are so many varying levels of disability. Some people don't need to be in a chair all the time, sometimes they need to be in it occasionally. Yeah, it's kind of a hard thing.((WN))  Also talking to the classifiers and they mentioned the people playing [wheelchair] basketball who have no disability at all but are important to the different teams, that carry their bags and stuff. Tina McKenzie: So important, yeah. It's the support network and I think that when we started developing Women's National League to start in 2000, one of the models that we took that off was the Canadian Women's National League. They run an amazing national league with huge amounts of able bodied women coming in and playing it, and they travel all over Canada [playing] against each other and they do have a round robin in certain areas like our Women's National League as well but it's so popular over there that it's hard to get on the team. They have a certain amount of women with disabilities and then other able bodied women that just want to come along and play because they see it as a really great sport. And that's how we tried to model our Women's National League off. It's about getting many women just to play sport, realistically.((WN))  Getting women to play sport, whether disabled or not, is another story. And there seems to be a reluctance amongst women to participate in sports, particularly sports that they regard as being men's sports.Tina McKenzie: Yeah, a masculine sport.((WN))  They would much rather play a sport that is a women's sport. Tina McKenzie: Yeah, it's really hard. I think it's about just encouraging people, communicating, having a really nice welcoming, come and try day. We run a... like Sarah [Stewart] actually this yeah will be running the women's festival of sport, which is on the 30th of January. And that's an amazing tournament. That actually started from club championship days, where we used to run club championships. And then the club championships then used to feed in to our Women's National League. Club championships used to about getting as many women to come along and play whether they're AB or have a disability. It's just about participation. It'll be a really fun weekend. And it's a pretty easy weekend for some of us.((WN))  Where is it?Tina McKenzie: Next year, in 2014, it'll be January the 30th at Narrabeen. We hold it every year. And last year we got the goalball girls to come along and play. So we had half of the goalball girls come and play for the weekend and they had an absolute brilliant time. Finding young girls that are walking down the street that just want to come and play sport. Or they have a friend at high school that has a disability. And it's just about having a nice weekend, meeting other people that have disabilities or not have disabilities and just playing together. It's a brilliant weekend. And every year we always have new faces come along and we hope that those new faces stay around and enjoy the weekend. Because it's no so highly competitive, it's just about just playing. Like last year I brought three or four friends of mine, flew up from Melbourne, ABs, just to come along and play. It was really nice that I had the opportunity to play a game of basketball with the friends that I hang out with. Which was really nice. So the sport's not just Paralympics.((WN))  How does Victoria compare with New South Wales?Tina McKenzie: Oh, that's a thing to ask! (laughs) Look I think both states go in highs and lows, in different things. I think all the policies that have been changing in who's supporting who and... like, Wheelchair Sports New South Wales do a good job at supporting the basketball community. Of course, there's always a willingness for more money to come in but they run a fairly good support and so does the New South Wales Institute of Sport. It's definitely gotten better since I first started up there. And then, it's really hard to compare because both states do things very differently. Yeah, really differently and I always remember being in Victoria... I dunno when that was... in early 2000. New South Wales had an amazing program. It seemed so much more supportive than what we had down here in Victoria. But then even going to New South Wales and seeing the program that they have up there, it wasn't as brilliant as... the grass isn't always greener on the other side, cause there there good things and there were weren't so great things about the both programs in Victoria and in New South Wales so... The VIS [Victorian Institute of Sport] do some great support with some of the athletes down here, and NSWIS [New South Wales Instituted of Sport] are building and improving and I know their program's changed quite a lot now with Tom [Kyle] and Ben [Osborne] being involved with NSWIS so I can't really give feedback on how that program's running but in short I know that when NSWIS employed Ben Osborne to come along and actually coach us as a basketball individual and as in group sessions it was the best thing that they ever did. Like, it was so good to be able to have one coach to actually go and go we do an individual session or when are you running group sessions and it just helped me. It helped you train. It was just a really... it was beneficial. Whereas Victoria don't have that at the moment. So both states struggle some days. I mean, back in 2000 Victoria had six or seven Gliders players, and then New South Wales had as many, and then it kind of does a big swap. It depends on what the state infrastructure is, what the support network is, and how local comps are running, how the national league's running, and it's about numbers. It's all about numbers.((WN))  At the moment you'll notice a large contingent of Gliders from Western Australia.Tina McKenzie: Yes, yes, I have seen that, yeah. And that's good because its... what happens is, someone comes along in either state, or wherever it may be, and they're hugely passionate about building and improving that side of things and they have the time to give to it, and that's what's happened in WA [Western Australia]. Which has been great. Ben Ettridge has been amazing, and so has John. And then in New South Wales you have Gerry driving that years ago. Gerry has always been a hugely passionate man about improving numbers, about participation, and individuals' improvement, you know? So he's been quite a passionate man about making sure people are improving individually. And you know, Gerry Hewson's been quite a driver of wheelchair basketball in New South Wales. He's been an important factor, I think.((WN))  The news recently has been Basketball Australia taking over the running of things. The Gliders now have a full time coach.Tina McKenzie: Yeah, which is fantastic! That's exciting. It's a good professional move, you know? It's nice to actually know that that's what's happening and I think that only will lead to improvement of all the girls, and the Gliders may go from one level up to the next level which is fantastic so... and Tom sounds like a great man so I really hope that he enjoys himself.((WN))  I'm sure he is.Tina McKenzie: Yeah, I've done some work with Tom. He's a good guy.((WN))  Did you do some work with him?Tina McKenzie: Ah, well, no, I just went up to Brisbane a couple of times and did some development days. Played in one of their Australia Day tournaments with some of the developing girls that they have. We did a day camp leading into that. Went and did a bit of mentoring I guess. And it was nice to do that with Tom. That was a long time before Tom... I guess Tom had just started on the men's team back them. He was very passionate about improving everyone, which he still is.((WN))  Watching the Gliders and the Rollers... with the Rollers, they can do it. With the Gliders... much more drama from the Gliders in London. For a time we didn't even know if they were going to make the finals. Lost that game against Canada.Tina McKenzie: Yeah, that wasn't a great game. No. It was pretty scary. But, you know, we always fight back. In true Gliders style. Seems to be... we don't like to take the easy road, we like to take the hard road, sometimes.((WN))  Apparently.Tina McKenzie: It's been a well-known thing. I don't know why it is but it just seems to happen that way.((WN))  You said you played over 100 [international] games. By our count there was 176 before you went to London, plus two games there makes 178 international caps. Which is more than some teams that you played against put together. Tina McKenzie: Yeah, I thought I'd be up to nearly 200. Look, I think it's an amazing thing to have that many games under your belt and the experience that's gained me throughout the years, and you've got to be proud about it. Proud that I stayed in there and competed with one of the best teams in the world. I always believed that the Gliders can be the best in the world but...((WN))  You need to prove it.Tina McKenzie: Need to get there. Just a bit extra.((WN))  Before every game in London there was an announcement that at the World Championships and the Paralympics "they have never won".Tina McKenzie: No, no. I remember 2000 in Sydney, watching the girls play against Canada in 2000. Terrible game. Yet they were a brilliant team in 2000 as well. I think the Gliders have always had a great team. Just unfortunately, that last final game. We haven't been able to get over that line yet.((WN))  You were in the final game in 2004.Tina McKenzie: Yep, never forget that. It was an amazing game.((WN))  What was it like?Tina McKenzie: I think we played our gold medal game against the USA the first game up. We knew that we had to beat USA that day, that morning. It was 8am in the morning, maybe 8:30 in the morning and it was one of the earliest games that we played and we'd been preparing for this game knowing that we had to beat USA to make sure that our crossovers would be okay, and knew that we'd sit in a really good position against the rest of the teams that we would most likely play. And I think that being my first ever Paralympic Games it was unforgettable. I think I'll never, not forget it. The anticipation, adrenalin and excitement. And also being a little bit scared sometimes. It was really an amazing game. We did play really, really well. We beat America by maybe one point I think that day. So we played a tough, tough game. Then we went into the gold medal game... I just don't think we had much left in our energy fuel. I think it was sort of... we knew that we had to get there but we just didn't have enough to get over the line, and that was really unfortunate. And it was really sad. It was sad that we knew that we could actually beat America, but at the end of the day the best team wins.((WN))  The best team on the court on the day.     Tina McKenzie: Yeah, absolutely. And that can change any day. It depends where your team's at. What the ethos is like. and so it's... Yeah, I don't think you can actually say that every team's gonna be on top every day, and it's not always going to be that way. I'm hoping the Gliders will put it all together and be able to take that way through and get that little gold medal. That would be really nice. Love to see that happen.((WN))  I'd like to see that happen. I'd really like to see them win. In Toronto, apparently, because the Canadian men are not in the thing, the Canadians are going to be focusing on their women's team. They apparently didn't take their best team and their men were knocked out by Columbia or Mexico or something like that.  Tina McKenzie: Wow.((WN))  And in the women's competition there's teams like Peru. But I remember in London that Gliders were wrong-footed by Brazil, a team that they had never faced before. Nearly lost that game.       Tina McKenzie: (laughs) Oh yes. Brazil were an unknown factor to us. So they were quite unknown. We'd done a bit of scouting but if you've never played someone before you get into an unknown situation. We knew that they'd be quite similar players to Mexico but you know what? Brazil had a great game. They had a brilliant game. We didn't have a very good game at all. And it's really hard going into a game that you know that you need to win unbeknown to what all these players can do. You can scout them as much as you want but it's actually about being on court and playing them. That makes a huge difference. I think one of the things here in Australia is that we play each other so often. We play against each other so often in the Women's National League. We know exactly what... I know that Shelley Chaplin is going to want to go right and close it up and Cobi Crispin is going to dive underneath the key and do a spin and get the ball. So you've actually... you know what these players want to do. I know that Kylie Gauci likes to double screen somewhere, and she'll put it in, and its great to have that knowledge of what your players really like to do when you're playing with them but going into a team like Brazil we knew a couple of the players, what they like to do but we had no idea what their speed was like or what their one-pointers were going to do. Who knows? So it was a bit of an unknown.((WN))  They'll definitely be an interesting side when it comes to Rio.Tina McKenzie: I think they'll be quite good. And that happened with China. I'll always remember seeing China when we were in Korea for the first time and going "Wow, these girls can hardly move a chair" but some of them could shoot, and they went from being very fresh players to going into China as quite a substantial team, and then yet again step it up again in London. And they're a good team. I think its really important as not to underestimate any team at a Paralympics or at a World Cup. I mean, Netherlands have done that to us over and over again.((WN))  They're a tough team too.Tina McKenzie: They're a really tough team and they're really unpredictable sometimes. Sometimes when they're on, they're on. They're tough. They're really tough. And they've got a little bit of hunger in them now. Like, they're really hungry to be the top team. And you can see that. And I remember seeing that in Germany, in Beijing.((WN))  The Germans lost to the Americans in the final in Beijing.Tina McKenzie: Yes. Yeah, they did.((WN))  And between 2008 and 2012 all they talked about was the US, and a rematch against the US. But of course when it came to London, they didn't face the US at all, because you guys knocked the US out of the competition.Tina McKenzie: Yeah, we did. It was great. A great game that.((WN))  You won by a point.Tina McKenzie: Fantastic. Oh my God I came. Still gives me heart palpitations.((WN))  It went down to a final shot. There was a chance that the Americans would win the thing with a shot after the siren. Well, a buzzer-beater. Tina McKenzie: Tough game. Tough game. That's why you go to the Paralympics. You have those tough, nail-biting games. You hope that at the end of the day that... Well, you always go in as a player knowing that you've done whatever you can do.((WN))  Thankyou very much for this.Tina McKenzie: That's alright. No problems at all!Recently, Wikinews spent time with with Canadian Paralympic skier Vanessa Knight who was at Copper Mountain, Colorado for the IPC Nor-Am Cup.((Wikinews))  We're interviewing Vanessa Knight, who's from Canada.Vanessa Knight: That's right!((WN))  And what kind of skier are you?Vanessa Knight: I am a disabled racer. I have a left arm amputation and I'm a speed skier.((WN))  So you're one of the standing skiers.Vanessa Knight: Yes.((WN))  I've been asking a lot of Paralympic disability skiers, what is the craziest skier of the slope? The standing ones, the blind ones, or the mono skiers?Vanessa Knight: Oh my God, the blind ones for sure. I couldn't imagine throwing myself down a hill without seeing anything. Especially the B1s. They have duct tape on their goggles.((WN))  Where from Canada are you from?Vanessa Knight: I'm from Quebec. Montreal.((WN))  And how long have you been skiing?Vanessa Knight:  I've just entered my fourth year.((WN))  And are you going to Sochi?Vanessa Knight: I hope so!((WN))  Are you going to beat... oh! Australia doesn't have any skiers for you to beat. Do you think the level of competition for women's disability skiing is high enough to give the sport a future?Vanessa Knight: I think the level of competition is high enough, yes. But I still think we need more racers and people to get involved and really promote the sport, because, I mean, the more the merrier, right?((WN))  Why are there so many men in skiing compared to women?    Vanessa Knight: I guess some girls are just scared and they don't want to throw themselves out there. But I'm not like that and neither are the rest of the girls here. They're not afraid to throw themselves down a hill and go fast.((WN))  Do you think skiers are some of the craziest Paralympic athletes?Vanessa Knight: Oh definitely.((WN))  Is there anything you want to say about disability skiing in Canada that people in Australia or the world should know?Vanessa Knight: Pretty much to say: It's really cold in Canada. And we love it!Recently, Wikinews spent time with with Chilean Paralympic skier Jorge Migueles who was in Copper Mountain, Colorado for the IPC Nor-Am Cup.((Wikinews))  I'm interviewing Jorge Migueles, he is here from Chile.  And you're from Santiago.Jorge Migueles: Yes, from Santiago.((WN))  What you're what classification?Jorge Migueles: LW4, I have a prosthetic I ski with, special for skiing, I have an amputation below the knee.((WN))  When people think of skiing, they don't automatically think Chile as a great place for skiers, and developing skiers. How did the skier [Jorge Migueles] from Chile become a skier?Jorge Migueles: Yes it is a good place because all the big teams — USA, Austria, Canada — go for training there and they go [...] in September because the snow is very hard for training, very icy, and it is very close to Santiago, to the airport, it is more easy for the logistics for the team.((WN))  I take it that you really like skiing?Jorge Migueles: Yeah.((WN))  Do you do any other sports?Jorge Migueles: Yes, I competed in triathlon, but only for a hobby. I got training in Santiago before to come here, to ski[?] here and one, two months in Europe.((WN))  So the triathlon helps you with your skiing?Jorge Migueles: Yeah.((WN))  I take it your taking to go to Sochi?Jorge Migueles: Yeah, I try.((WN))  Has your country [Chile] won any Paralympic medals in the winter games?Jorge Migueles: No, never, neither[?] olympic nor paralympic.((WN))  So you want to be the first winter Paralympian medal from your country?Jorge Migueles: I try that. Very difficult.((WN))  Do you get government support for the winter Paralympic side?Jorge Migueles: Not yet, but I try and get support from the government because in Chile all the sport in the summer in Santiago 2014 is all the sport in the summer is all they reimburse[?], the monies go there, in the winter it's more difficult. But I try that.((WN))  Is winter sport popular in Chile?Jorge Migueles: Yeah, it's popular, but it's very expensive to practice skiing or snowboard.((WN))  The only other major news story that people know about in Chile is the earthquake, that didn't impact you that much you at all?Jorge Migueles: Yes, a lot, because when [...] had to stay here in United States training, and seeing in the news the earthquake, was very hard.((WN))  And your family and everything was okay, with that?Jorge Migueles: Yes, they're okay.((WN))  Is there anything people who know nothing about Paralympic sport in Chile should know?Jorge Migueles: In London, in the past Olympic Game, one person with disability [...], he won gold medal in London.  [...] He was the first Paralympic to win a medal in the history of Chile.  And now the people know this movement [The Paralympics].((WN))  That's very cool.  Okay.  Thank you very, very much.Jorge Migueles: Thank you.Alfred Hsing, a US martial artist with Chinese origins, besides having a long history of martial arts training in various styles, such as traditional kung fu, tae kwon do and karate, considers wushu – an athletic sport based on Chinese martial arts – as a form of art that pushes one's physical limits and stimulates the mind at the same time. After having won the gold medal at the 10th World Wushu Championships, he became international movie star Jet Li's personal assistant and went on to do stunts, action choreography, and land roles in movies.Hungarian Wikinews contributor Teemeah has interviewed Alfred Hsing about his views on martial arts, life and Wikipedia.London, England — On Wednesday, Wikinews interviewed Duncan Campbell, one of the creators of wheelchair rugby.((Laura Hale))  You're Duncan Campbell, and you're the founder of... Duncan Campbell: One of the founders of wheelchair rugby.((Laura Hale))  And you're from Canada, eh?Duncan Campbell: Yes, I'm from Canada, eh! (laughter)((Laura Hale))  Winnipeg? Duncan Campbell: Winnipeg, Manitoba.((Laura Hale))  You cheer for — what's that NHL team?Duncan Campbell: I cheer for the Jets!((Laura Hale))  What sort of Canadian are you?Duncan Campbell: A Winnipeg Jets fan! (laughter)((Laura Hale))  I don't know anything about ice hockey. I'm a Chicago Blackhawks fan.((Hawkeye7))  Twenty five years ago...Duncan Campbell: Thirty five years ago!((Laura Hale))  They said twenty five in the stadium...Duncan Campbell: I know better.((Hawkeye7))  So it was 1977.((Laura Hale))  You look very young. Duncan Campbell: Thank you. We won't get into how old I am.((Hawkeye7))  So how did you invent the sport?Duncan Campbell: I've told this story so many times. It was a bit of a fluke in a way, but there were five of us. We were all quadriplegic, that were involved in sport, and at that time we had the Canadian games for the physically disabled. So we were all involved in sports like table tennis or racing or swimming. All individual sports. And the only team sport that was available at that time was basketball, wheelchair basketball. But as quadriplegics, with hand dysfunction, a bit of arm dysfunction, if we played, we rode the bench. We'd never get into the big games or anything like that. So we were actually going to lift weights one night, and the volunteer who helped us couldn't make it. So we went down to the gym and we started throwing things around, and we tried a few things, and we had a volleyball. We kind  of thought: "Oh!  This is not bad. This is a lot of fun." And we came up with the idea in a night. Within one night.((Hawkeye7))  So all wheelchair rugby players are quadriplegics? Duncan Campbell: Yes. All wheelchair rugby players have to have a disability of some kind in all four limbs.((Laura Hale))  When did the classification system for wheelchair rugby kick in?Duncan Campbell: It kicked in right away because there was already a classification system in place for wheelchair basketball. We knew basketball had a classification system, and we very consciously wanted to make that all people with disabilities who were quadriplegics got to play. So if you make a classification system where the people with the most disability are worth more on the floor, and you create a system where there are only so many points on the floor, then the people with more disability have to play. And what that does is create strategy. It creates a role.((Hawkeye7))   Was that copied off wheelchair basketball?Duncan Campbell: To some degree, yes.((Laura Hale))  I assume you're barracking for Canada. Have they had any classification issues? That made you Duncan Campbell: You know, I'm not going to... I can't get into that in a major way in that there's always classification issues. And if you ask someone from basketball, there's classification issues. If you ask someone from swimming... There's always classification issues. The classifiers have the worst job in the world, because nobody's ever satisfied with what they do. But they do the best they can. They're smart. They know what they're doing. If the system needs to change, the athletes will, in some way, encourage it to change.((Laura Hale))  Do you think the countries that have better classifiers... as someone with an Australian perspective they're really good at classification, and don't get theirs overturned, whereas the Americans by comparison have had a number of classification challenges coming in to these games that they've lost. Do you think that having better classifiers makes a team better able to compete at an international level?Duncan Campbell: What it does is ensures that you practice the right way. Because you know the exact classifications of your players then you're going to lineups out there that are appropriate and fit the classification. If your classifications are wrong then you may train for six months with a lineup that becomes invalid when that classification. So you want to have good classifiers, and you want to have good classes.((Laura Hale))  When you started in 1977, I've seen pictures of the early wheelchairs. I assume that you were playing in your day chair? Duncan Campbell: Yes, all the time. And we had no modifications. And day chairs at that time were folding chairs. They were Earjays or Stainless. That's all the brands there were. The biggest change in the game has been wheelchairs.((Laura Hale))  When did you retire?Duncan Campbell: I never retired. Still play. I play locally. I play in the club level all the time.((Laura Hale))  When did you get your first  rugby wheelchair? Duncan Campbell: Jesus, that's hard for me to even think about. A long time ago. I would say maybe twenty years ago.((Laura Hale))  Were you involved in creating a special chair, as Canadians were pushing the boundaries and creating the sport?Duncan Campbell: To a degree. I think everybody was. Because you wanted the chair that fit you. Because they are all super designed to an individual. Because it allows you to push better, allows you to turn better. Allows you to use your chair in better ways on the court. Like you've noticed that the defensive chairs are lower and longer. That's because the people that are usually in a defensive chair have a higher disability, which means they have less balance. So they sit lower, which means they can use their arms better, and longer so they can put screens out and set ticks for those high point players who are carrying the ball. It's very much strategic.((Hawkeye7))  I'd noticed that in wheelchair basketball the low point player actually gets more court time...Duncan Campbell: ...because that allows the high point player to play. And its the same in this game. Although in this game there's two ways to go. You can go a high-low lineup, which is potentially two high point players and two very low point players, which is what Australia does right now with Ryley Batt and the new kid Chris Bond. They have two high point players, and two 0.5 point players. It makes a very interesting scenario for, say, the US, who use four mid-point players. In that situation, all four players can carry the ball; in the Australian situation, usually only two of them can carry the ball.((Laura Hale))  Because we know you are going soon, the all-important question: can Canada beat the Australians tonight? Duncan Campbell: Of course they are. (laughter)((Laura Hale))  Because Australians love to gamble, what's your line on Canada? Duncan Campbell: It's not a big line! I'm not putting a big line on it! (laughter) I'd say it's probably 6–5.((Hawkeye7))  Is your colour commentary for the Canadian broadcast?Duncan Campbell: That was for the IPC. I did the GB–US game this morning. I do the Sweden–Australia game tomorrow at two. And then I'm doing the US–France game on the last day.((Laura Hale))  Are you happy with the level of coverage the Canadians are providing your sport?Duncan Campbell: No.((Laura Hale))  Thank you for an honest answer. Duncan Campbell: Paralympic Sports TV is their own entity. They webcast, but they're not a Canadian entity. Our Canadian television is doing... can I swear?((Laura Hale))  Yeah! Go ahead!Duncan Campbell: No! (laughter) They're only putting on an hour a day. A highlight package, which to me is...((Hawkeye7))  It's better than the US.Duncan Campbell: Yes, I've heard it's better than the US. At the same time, it's crap. You have here [in Great Britain], they've got it on 18 hours a day, and it's got good viewership. When are we going to learn in North America that viewership is out there for it? How many times do we have to demonstrate it? We had the Paralympics in Vancouver two years ago, the Winter Paralympics, and we had crappy coverage there. There was an actual outburst demand to put the opening ceremonies on TV because they weren't going to do it. And they had to do it, because everybody complained. So they did it, but they only did it in BC, in our home province, where they were holding it. The closing ceremonies they broadcast nationally because the demand was so high. But they still haven't changed their attitudes.((Laura Hale))  I have one last question: what did it mean for you when they had a Canadian flag bearer who was a wheelchair rugby player?Duncan Campbell: I recruited that guy. It was fantastic. I recruited him. Found him playing hockey. And that guy has put in so much time and effort into the game. He absolutely deserves it. No better player.((Laura Hale))  Thank you!((Hawkeye7))  Thank you! Much appreciated.Earlier this week, Wikinews interviewed Sarah Walsh, a former Australian women's national soccer team (Matilidas) player, about women's football in the country.The Australian women's team is currently ranked ninth by FIFA, down one spot from the previous quarter when they were tied at eighth with the North Korea women's national football team.  Meanwhile, Australia's men (Socceroos) are currently ranked 59th in the world, between the Burkina Faso and Slovakia national football team.  Walsh retired from the national team in September of last year, after scoring 32 goals in 71 appearances. She was on Matildas side that qualified for the World Cup for the first time while playing in the Asian Football Confederation instead of the Oceania Football Confederation.  She also played in two World Cup quarter-finals for the team. Playing in Australia's top level domestic league, the W-League, she won the league championship in 2009.  She retired from the league this year.  Walsh played professionally in the United States for Sky Blue FC and Saint Louis Athletica.((WN)) :  The Socceroos are ranked 59th by FIFA.  The Matildas are ranked 8th by FIFA in the latest rankings. Should media coverage correlate to team performance and internationally rankings? Is there an element of tall poppy syndrome in the coverage of the Socceros?  What other factors can be used to explain the relative differences in media attention other than performance?Sarah Walsh: Traditionally in Australia, male sports have dominated media coverage. Slowly we are seeing women's sports feature more frequently in mainstream media publications. There is a growing interest in women's sports, especially women's national teams in general here in Australia. With time, the public will be exposed to more female sports on a daily basis and perhaps will build the same affections for these female sports. As a teenager, I was exposed to NRL living in Sydney, so naturally I have a strong interest in this game along with football (soccer). Young female teenagers today, have the option to turn the TV on and watch the W-league and follow their heroes. I believe in 5–10 years' time we will see a cultural change with regards to media coverage and gender bias.((WN)) : What's the difference in style of play between the men and women's national teams?Sarah Walsh: MenThey appear to play a possession-based game working at effective possession combined with a developing system of pressing using our natural athleticism and high work rate as well as our cultural mental strength.Sarah Walsh: WomenThe women seem to employ a more defensive and well organized "block" making it hard for teams to play through particularly in the middle and our back thirds utilizing transitional moments (BPO – BP) to good effect with quick attacks through the natural speed of certain players.((WN)) : Why are the Matildas more successful in international competitions and ranking wise than the Socceroos?Sarah Walsh: There could be a number of contributing factors. One in particular could be dues to financial reasons. Given there is more financial support for men's national teams globally in general,  I believe the competition across the board is more extensive. Due to this, there are more teams that compete at a higher level, so effectively this would make it difficult for the Socceroos to reach the same ranking as Matildas.((WN)) :   Why do you think men don't watch the Matildas in the same numbers as they watch the Socceroos?Sarah Walsh: Answer similar to question 1.((WN)) : Does the media feed into traditional Australian gender stereotypes by not covering elite women's sports?Sarah Walsh: Similar to question 1.((WN)) :  What is your role in sports? Journalist? Academic? Sport administrator? Player?  Please provide one to two sentence biography to contextualize your answers.Sarah Walsh: I started playing football at 5 years of age. I made my debut for the Matildas at 21 (2004–2012) I have spent the past two years working in community football at FFA delivering a Drug and Alcohol program. I am currently the Women's Football Coordinator and Female Elite Player mentor at FFA. Actually on wikipedia if you would like to cut and paste all that info!Homebush Bay, New South Wales —Wikinews sat down with Great Britain men's national wheelchair basketball player Ade Oregembe before a practice session at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge in Sydney.Nigerian-born Oregembe, one of twenty-four children, contracted polio when an infant.  He started playing basketball after a random person suggested he take up the sport. Oregembe stated he'd never previously seriously considered any other sport.  His wheelchair basketball journey has taken him to Spain (to play in their local league) and around the world with the Great Britain national team.Oregembe was asked about two of the big Paralympic stories:  Oscar Pistorius, and  5 point players —able-bodied competitors— competing in their sport at the Paralympics.  He did not support Pistorius's inclusion in the Olympics, nor inclusion of able-bodied athletes in wheelchair basketball at the Paralympics.While the United Kingdom has a reputation for sport-related racism, Oregembe said he had not experienced much of it on the courts.  Elsewhere though,  it was a different issue as he had experienced racism both to his face and behind his back, noting it was a particular problem in Spain.Oregembe's Great Britain side kicks off their London campaign on August 30 against the Germany men's national wheelchair basketball team.Homebush Bay, New South Wales —Wikinews sat down with Great Britain men's national wheelchair basketball player Joni Pollock before a practice session at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge in Sydney.British-born Pollock was born with the condition spina bifida. He explained he could walk with difficulty up until age twelve or thirteen, after which he began using a wheelchair. Shortly after this, he began playing wheelchair basketball. He attended a disabilities tournament for children with disabilities in England, where he tried both wheelchair basketball, since he came from a town where team sports were popular; and wheelchair tennis, as he'd played with an able-bodied friend. Ultimately, he chose wheelchair basketball as it was a team sport.  Wikinews asked Pollock about being loud towards his team mates during the match on July 20 between the Australian Rollers and the Great Britain Bulldogs.  He said he was out of wheelchair basketball for nine months due to a pressure sore and surgery on his shoulder, and has been making a comeback since January, with the doctors and physiotherapists giving him the all-clear in April. On that night, he said, the Australian team used bullying tactics and some of his teammates on the British team didn't step up to win the game. He also said that no matter what team his team plays against, he has a target on his back because of his calibre of playing in the game, and his team failed to to understand it that night, leaving him frustrated with his team and himself; and, he hates coming to Australia during a Paralympic year since the home town —that is, Australian— referees do not protect the visiting team from the home team's dirty playing, which puts the British team's gold medal prospects in jeopardy.Wikinews also asked Pollock his opinions regarding Oscar Pistorius. Pollock believes Pistorius shouldn't be competing in the Olympics if other Paralympic athletes can't compete. He also mentioned reservations about certain technical aspects, such as whether Pistorius would be the same height if he still had his legs rather then his prosthetic legs. Asked about 5 point players playing in wheelchair basketball, he said he believes 5 point players can play with other point players but not in the Paralympics, and said 5 point players currently play in the domestic league but not at the elite level, to boost the number of players participating and to help the development of the game.Wikinews also questioned him about tattoos worn by members of the British team. In previous years, he said, only one or two forwards had tattoos, but now almost everyone has one as having tattoos is currently in fashion. He said he got his first tattoo at the age of sixteen and only recently had it removed. He also has tattoos on his right arm, depicting the logos of the Paralympics and World championships in which he competed.Pollocks's team begins its London campaign on August 30, against the Germany men's national wheelchair basketball team.London, England— Wednesday, following his team's 64 points to 52 win over Canada, Wikinews interviewed Greg Smith of Australia's national wheelchair rugby team.((Laura Hale))  You were the flag bearer for Australia. The Canadians had a flag bearer out there. Any special meaning in this game with two flag bearers from your sport?Greg Smith: I don't think so. ... When we meet Canada it's always a bit of a fight, and I think that's what happened tonight.((Laura Hale))   Before this game we had an opportunity to talk to [one of the founders] of the sport, Duncan Campbell, and he said the Canadians were supposed to beat you by a few points. Greg Smith: Did he? You better find the founder of the game and tell him that they still have a bit of work to do there.((Hawkeye7))  You've already got [three] Paralympic gold medals, and yet you switched to wheelchair rugby.  Why was that?Greg Smith: Yeah. I'd had a good time with racing. I'd achieved the things I wanted to achieve. I had some time off. Wheelchair rugby came along and I started to play recreationally. The competitive juices got flowing again and here we are.((Laura Hale))  You guys think you have a serious shot at the medals?Greg Smith:Look, if we can do the things we've been training on, and the things we have to work on, we've got just as much of a shot as everybody else. We'll just keep doing it process by process.((Laura Hale))  You played a great game.Greg Smith: Thank you.Wikinews on Sunday interviewed Deepa Malik, India's first female Paralympic medalist, who won the silver medal in the Women's Shot Put F53 event finals, at the 2016 Summer Paralympics being held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Malik lost the gold medal to Bahrain's Fatema Nedham, who had the best throw 4.76 metres, setting a new regional record in paralympic women's shot put.Arriving in Rio, Malik had initial trouble due to the airline losing her luggage; it didn't all arrive until three days later: clothes, opening ceremony outfit and equipment including competition belts.In early August there was a possibly that Malik might lose her spot on the Indian team going to Rio, with fellow female para athlete Karam Jyoti challenging Malik's selection and the Sport's Authority of Indian's selection process at the High Court of Delhi. The high court ruled against the plaintiff.Both of these events occurred against the wider backdrop of the Paralympic Committee of India being suspended by the International Paralympic Committee.  The Sports Authority of India took final authority over the Paralympic Committee of India for sending a team to Rio, with agreement from the International Paralympic Committee; this arrangement allowed India to compete under their own flag at the 2016 Summer Paralympics.((Wikinews))   Congratulations on your result.Deepa Malik: Thank you so much.((WN))  Even though you are currently waiting in terms of the end result of the protest.DM:  Absolutely, but I'm happy with my performance, I'm happy that I could improve and I could prove myself, there were a lot of questions back home on my selection and on my hard work. My single-minded focus that I had put into this journey of being a Paralympian. Well, I am just so anxious about the results.((WN))  So how much did the court case and KLM losing your luggage impact on your preparations and your result today?DM:  Yes, but I'm happy that my husband was my coach here, and, so, I had huge moral support in terms of keeping my mind and everything in peace. Most of the equipment was available in the gym, we had to alter the training a bit like the throw days couldn't happen, so we instead exercised. No, I think that is what sports teaches you, you can't live on excuses, I never lived on excuses.((WN))  You work around things.DM:  Yes, that's what we do, that's what a sportsman is suppose to do, rise again, and then fall and rise, and run, and I did exactly that.((WN))  What message should other Indian women take away from your participation and result in Rio?DM:  This is going to be the first female medal that India would have ever won in Paralympics and as it is I'm working aggressively towards transforming this entire concept of empowerment for the women, especially the women in disabilities in my country. So I'm really happy that this medal give my voice more value, more strength, and I'll be able to impact even more, though on the ninth of September the Prime Minister's jury has awarded me with the award of Women Transforming India, I'm so happy that within three days of getting that award, I have added another feather to it and proved that yes this journey of ability beyond disability. And not just disability, this is a universal message that if women put their minds to their dreams they can balance it; age, gender, disability, is all a state of mind. If you put your passion and hard work, you can get it, and in the Indian scenario were they say infrastructure is a challenge, women participation that are taboo, religiously and psychologically, disabilities taken as a curse, dependability[?] increases because of lack of infrastructure, well, time to get rid of the excuses. We have to start erasing the excuses and believe your own self and that's the message I'm carrying with all the activities that I do whether it is car rallying, motorbiking or swimming across a river, every record or every unique activity that I've undertaken and just below paralysis has been aimed at changing the stereotypical image of a women and also a women in disability.  ((WN))  Will you and your daughter both be trying to represent India at the 2020 Games in Tokyo?DM:  I'm very sure about myself, but my daughter, though, she's a Paralympian, yes, which again was considered a huge taboo in my society that oh my god both the mother and the daughter both have a physical disability, what is going to happen to these two, but we did good and she is working as a youth council representative in the Commonwealth countries, for the Paralympics specially, and her work though her foundation called Wheeling Happiness has earned her the young leader award from the Queen of England, so I guess her focus is now shifting to more on community service and empowering others and not just herself. And she is leaving on first of October to Loughborough to do her PhD doctorate programme in disability sports psychology, I'm very sure Loughborough is going to give her a huge amount of sports [inaudible] but how much time she going to decide to devote to sports and studies is her decision entirely. That's her dream, her journey. ((WN))  How helpful was the Sports Authority of India in preparing and supporting your Rio ambitions? DM:  I think 100 per cent, because the biggest challenge we have back home is a customised training, or the infrastructure for that matter, so we were given the ability and the funds to train the way we wanted to train, and the funds were huge which were given to us, out accommodation, food, diet, physical therapist, psychologist, trainer, gym, everything was paid for, and customised, you want it and they give it. So I guess this was easy financially this time, because every expenses was taken care of, my husband could also take a sabbatical from his job and join my journey, and having him twenty-four seven and coaching me because he himself is an athlete, and have the best diet and counselling. I think it's worked wonders, so I give shout out and a huge applaud.((WN))  How important was it for you to have a carer in Rio?DM:  Yes, again we really have to appreciate the sports authority of India and also Paralympic Committee of India, which is going to start to function post-Rio in India. They were very very quick, they were very very adamant in giving the wheelchair people escorts.  And I need help twenty four seven, I'm just below paralysed so it was really huge, emotionally, mentally, psychically training-wise, every way I think the situation was perfect.((WN))  Thank you for your time.DM:  Thank you.Yesterday evening in La Molina, Spain, Wikinews sat down and talked with Irene Villa to discuss para-alpine skiing, disability sport, women's sport, and her own sporting career.  Villa was in town as part of activities taking place around the 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships, where one of her skiing club teammates is competing as a member of the Spanish team.  Her high profile in Spain has brought additional interest to para-alpine skiing and disability sport in general.((Wikinews)) : Hi we are interviewing Irene Villa, who is a disability skier from Spain and professional author, social figure, journalist, and psychologist. You are most well known for being a terrorist survivor, but you're here because of the [2013 Alpine Skiing] World Championships. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Hola estamos entrevistando a Irene Villa, esquiadora española, escritora, figura política, psicóloga y periodista. Aunque se le conoce más por haber sobrevivido a un atentado, se encuentra aquí por el Campeonato del Mundo [de Esquí Adaptado 2013].Irene Villa: I'm here because I love sitting ski, I practice and I compete, but since I got pregnant and my son was born I stopped competing. But before I had my son I competed against the people who will run tomorrow, the Germans who win, and I wanted to be here. I haven't raced in the World Cup, but I did race in the European Cup. And well, I'm also here to support paralympic sports. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Estoy aquí porque me encanta el esquí en silla, lo practico y he competido, pero desde que nació mi hijo dejé de competir, porque me quedé embarazada, pero antes de tener a mi hijo competí contra las que mañana corren, las alemanas que ganan, y quería estar aquí. Nunca Copa del Mundo, he corrido Copa de Europa. Y bueno, para apoyar al deporte paralímpico.((WN)) : In 2009 you said you were trying to make the 2010 Winter Paralympics. After giving birth are you going to continue with the sport and hope to make 2018? ((es))Spanish language: ‍En 2009 dijo que quería clasificarse para los Juegos Paralímpicos de Invierno de 2010. Tras dar a luz, ¿va a continuar con el deporte e intentar llegar a 2018?Irene Villa: I would love to. The thing is that you need a certain amount of IPCAS points. I'm now competing, on top of that I have an injury, tomorrow and the next day I will be training, and I don't know if I'll have enough time to make it. Sochi [Winter Paralympic Games of 2014] is right around the corner, next year, so it depends on how many point you've got. 2018? For sure. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Me encantaría. Lo que pasa que bueno, eso no se sabe, porque tienes que tener unos puntos IPCAS determinados y yo ahora estoy compitiendo, encima me he lesionado, y mañana y pasado voy a estar esquiando, y no sé si van a dar los tiempos  para llegar... Es que Sochi [Juegos Paralímpicos de 2014] está aquí al lado. Son el año que viene. Entonces depende de los puntos IPCAS que tengas. ¿2018? Seguro que sí.((WN)) : You compete in a lot of national competitions, and with disability sport in general, classification is a big issue. Competing in national competitions, does classification come into play, especially when there is so few women skiers in your group? ((es))Spanish language: ‍Participa en muchas competiciones nacionales, y en el deporte con discapacidad en general, las clasificaciones son un un tema polémico. En la competición nacional, ¿es la clasificación un factor tan determinante, especialmente cuando hay tan pocas esquiadoras en tu grupo?Irene Villa: Yes, certainly. You see, I have an advantage because I have buttocks, I have abs. I have an advantage over a teammate who has a spinal injury here [points to the high part of the back] and also competes. So of course classification is very important because we cannot have an advantage. I believe in competing in equal fairness, and disabilities vary so much that you need a good classification. Issues because of classification? Well, I think we are pretty well classified. For example, my fingers [shows hand where she lost three fingers] are not taken into account in classification, there's always going to be a small detail that they don't count. This is a disadvantage when holding the outrigger, and yet I'm classified like someone who is missing half a leg, for example. I'm missing both legs and three fingers. But, it's really complicated to finetune it... Because then we would need to have twenty thousand classifications. This is what we have. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Sí, claro que sí. Porque claro, yo tengo ventaja por ejemplo al tener glúteos, al tener abdominales, tengo ventaja sobre una compañera de mi equipo que tiene una lesión medular desde aquí [señala principio de la espalda] y también compite, así que por supuesto la clasificación es muy importante porque no podemos tener ventaja. Creo que tenemos que estar en igualdad de condiciones, y las discapacidades son tan distintas que tienes que tener una buena clasificación. ¿Problemas porque no te clasifican bien? Hombre pues yo creo que nosotras estamos bien clasificadas. Por ejemplo, a mi estos dedos [muestra mano en la que perdió tres dedos] no me los cuentan en la clasificación, claro, siempre va a haber algo pequeño que no te cuentan. Esto es una desventaja al coger el estabilo, y sin embargo estoy clasificada igual que una a la que le falta media pierna, por ejemplo. A mi me faltan las dos y tres dedos. Pero es que claro, es muy dificil dar justo... Porque entonces tendríamos que tener veintemil clasificaciones. Es lo que hay.((WN)) : Some of the skiers I've talked to in the mens' side, not in Spain, but from other countries, have complained about the quality of womens' skiing, and that there's not enough high quality competition. That's why I was interested in if classification was impacting women's skiing because there is so few women skiers, that classes seem they'd make it harder to find competitors in classes that are making the sport equitable and fair. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Algunos de los esquiadores de otros países con los que he hablado se quejaban de la calidad del esquí femenino, y la escasa calidad de la competición. Por eso me interesaba saber si la clasificación incidía en el esquí femenino al haber tan pocas esquiadoras, que las clases parece que hacen más dificil encontrar competidoras en clases que hacen el deporte más equitativo y justo.Irene Villa: Of course. In the case of the women, it is really hard to get a woman skiing, to have her compete in sit-ski. In fact, in Spain we exist thanks to Fundación También, which insisted in there being a female category. There was no female category, no women who dared. And we're the same who started out in 2007. There has been no new blood because women don't dare, because it is a tough sport, that requires sponsors —that do not exist—, or your own money, and it also demands courage and withstanding bad moments. I've suffered cold and injuries, and had some really tough times. You take away the best with you, but it is very hard, and men resist the cold better. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Claro. Es que en las mujeres cuesta muchísimo que una mujer se ponga a esquiar, a competir en silla. De hecho en España estamos gracias a la Fundación También, que es la que se empeñó en que hubiese categoría femenina. No existía la categoría femenina, no había mujeres que se atrevieran. Y de hecho somos las mismas que empezamos en el 2007. No se ha renovado porque no se atreven, es un deporte duro, que además requiere sponsors, que no hay, o dinero de tu bolsillo, y además requiere valentía y malos ratos. Yo he pasado mucho frío y muchas caidas, y lo he pasado muy mal. La verdad es que te quedas siempre con lo bueno, pero es muy duro, y es cierto que los hombres son más fuertes para el frío.((WN)) : Your personal experiences have adequately prepared you to hurl yourself down the mountain at high speed?  ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Sus experiencias personales le han preparado adecuadamente para lanzarse pendiente abajo a máxima velocidad?Irene Villa: At the beginning, it was very scary. The first times were very hard: falls, injuries... I even dislocated my vertebra and got a prothesis for the neck because of a hernia, one teammate broke her clavicle, another her femur... It has a lot of risks, but the truth is, speed hooks you! Once you learn to plant the ski pole, angle yourself, learn the position you must use, which is like a motorcycle rider's, once you see you can run a lot and not fall, speed is addictive and you want to go faster. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Al principio, mucho miedo. Los comienzos fueron muy duros: caidas, lesiones... A mi incluso se me salió el disco del cuello, me tuvieron que poner una prótesis en el cuello por una hernia que tenía, otra se rompió la clavícula, otra el femur, en fin... Tiene mucho riesgo, pero la verdad que la velocidad engancha. Una vez que aprendes a clavar el canto, a angular, la posición en la que tienes que ir, que es como la de un motorista, una vez que ves que puedes correr mucho y no te caes, sí que engancha la velocidad y quieres ir cada vez más rápido.((WN)) : Most of the ski team looks like they come from the Madrid area? From the Fundación También? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿La mayor parte del equipo parece que vienen de Madrid? ¿De la Fundación También?Irene Villa: In my team we are from everywhere in Spain. Even Nathalie Carpanedo is from France. ((es))Spanish language: ‍En el equipo somos de todas partes de España. Incluso Nathalie [Carpanedo] es de Francia.((WN)) : How does a Frenchwoman become a Spanish skier? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Cómo se convierte una francesa en una esquiadora española?Irene Villa: Because she lives in Madrid. She has the Spanish nationality. Then we have another woman from the South of Spain, in Andalusia, from Tarragona in Catalonia, from Galicia... We are from all parts of Spain. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Porque vive en Madrid. Tiene la nacionalidad española. También tenemos a una mujer del sur de España, de Andalucía, otra de Tarragona en Cataluña, de Galicia... Las chicas venimos de todas las partes de España.((WN)) : So there's a national ski culture. People think of Spain as a place with beaches and no snow. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Así pues hay una cultura de esquí a nivel nacional. La gente piensa de España como un lugar con playas y nada de nieve.Irene Villa: There's not too much tradition of paralympic skiing, to be true. There's less. But we do have Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Del esquí adaptado no hay tanta cultura, eso es cierto. Hay menos. Pero bueno, tenemos Sierra Nevada y tenemos el Pirineo catalán, aragonés...((WN)) : The Paralympics in Spain are supported by the Plan ADO Paralímpico. Do they provide enough support to women and to winter sports in general? ((es))Spanish language: ‍Los deportistas paralímpicos reciben apoyo gracias al Plan ADO Paralímpico. ¿Proporcionan suficiente apoyo para las mujeres y los deportes de invierno en general?Irene Villa: The people in the national squad, like Úrsula Pueyo, would know that. If Plan ADO helps someone, it's the people in the national team, those who dedicate their lives to the sport. They offered it to me when I was at my peak, in 2010, when I won my first gold medals and wasn't yet married. They offered me to move to Baqueira, where Úrsula lives, with Nathalie, and with a Catalan girl too, but I declined, because when you have a life, a daily job, events, conferences, travels.... you can't leave it all for the sport. But I think the Plan does help the people who dedicate themselves to the sport, like Úrsula. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Eso lo saben los que están en el equipo nacional, como Úrsula Pueyo. Si el Plan ADO ayuda a alguien es a quienes están en el equipo nacional, a quienes dejan su vida por el deporte. A mi por ejemplo me lo plantearon cuando yo estaba en mi mejor momento, que fue en el 2010, que gané mis primeros oros y no estaba casada. Me plantearon irme a vivir a Baqueira donde vive Úrsula, con Nathalie, y con otra chica catalana, pero dije que no porque cuando tienes una vida, un trabajo diario, eventos, congresos, viajes... no podía dejarlo todo por el deporte. Pero creo que a la gente que sí que se dedica a ello sí le ayuda. Como a Úrsula.((WN)) : When I've read about disability skiing in Spain for women, they talk about you and they talk about Teresa Silva. Is there a way to get more attention for women skiers on that level, outside of using you and Teresa Silva as a vehicle? Not that you are not great for drawing attention! But how do you draw more attention to women's sports and high quality that women are capable of doing? ((es))Spanish language: ‍Cuando he leído sobre el esquí adaptado en España, suelen hablar de usted y Teresa Silva. ¿Existe alguna forma de atraer más atención a las esquiadoras, más allá de usarlas a ustedes como reclamo? ¡No es que no sean fantásticas para atraer atención! ¿Pero cómo se incrementa la atención al deporte femenino y a la alta calidad que las mujeres son capaces de lograr?Irene Villa: Oh, I would like that more people would join this sport or any other disability sport, that they practised it. And what we do is try to encourage them through the media, interviews, conferences... Teresa is the director of Fundación También, and she has access to talk with many people. As a speaker in motivation conferences and the like, I make people aware of it too. But it is difficult, because people try it out and love it, but will not race. Because racing is very risky and, well, you saw the slopes yesterday, sometimes they are hard, like a wall, and falling can be awful. But when we get the chance, we promote the sport and try to attract people that way, encouraging them to join this adventure that is sport. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Eso es lo que a mi me encantaría, que cada vez más gente se apuntase a este deporte o a cualquier deporte, que hiciese deporte con discapacidad. Y nosotros lo que hacemos es intentar a través de los medios de comunicación, a través de entrevistas, a través de congresos... Teresa es la directora de la Fundación, y tiene acceso a hablar a mucha gente. Yo como ponente de conferencias, de motivación y tal, también lo doy a conocer. Pero es dificil, como digo, porque la gente lo prueba y le encanta, pero dicen que no a la carrera. Porque la carrera tiene muchos riesgos y porque, bueno ya visteis la pista ayer, que es complicada, a veces es muy dura, es un marmol, y las caidas son muy jorobadas. Pero sí que en cuanto podemos y tenemos la oportunidad, lo damos a conocer e intentamos atraer a la gente de esa forma, animándola a que se unan a esta aventura del deporte.((WN)) : As an outsider from, not Spain, I know you are a political figure. Has that gotten in the way of your ability to be a sportswoman?  ((es))Spanish language: ‍Como alguien que no es de España, entiendo que usted es una figura política. ¿Ha sido eso un obstáculo a la hora de ser una deportista?Irene Villa: No... Besides, that part about me being a political figure... I have nothing to do with politics. I don't know why people always... Why? Because of what happened to me. I was a kid. A 12 year old has nothing to do with politics. We know too that ETA has attacked people who had nothing to do with politics as well. My mother was a police director. What may have interfered is the fact that since I was a known figure I've tried that other people.... Let's see, for example I started doing sport so other people would know you could do sport. So it is true that the fact of being known has pushed me to do more things that I would've probably not have done. Because I wanted to show people that you could ski. And I ended up hooked. I only did it for a tv reportage. "Okay okay, a reportage and let's have people know that yes, we can". In fact, my book is titled "Knowing that you can" [Saber que se puede, in Spanish]. Later I got hooked. But the fact of being known motivates you to show other people a path that could be very beneficial to them, and at the end you get addicted to it. ((es))Spanish language: ‍No... Es que además, lo de política me suena a que... yo no tengo nada que ver con la política. No sé por qué la gente siempre... ¿Por qué? Porque me pasó lo que me pasó. Era una niña. Una persona que tiene 12 años no puede tener nada que ver con la política. ETA ya sabemos que ha atentado contra gente que no tenía que ver con la política. Mi madre era funcionaria de policía. El caso es que lo que quizás ha podido interferir es que el hecho de ser una persona conocida he tratado de intentar que otras personas... A ver, yo empecé por ejemplo a hacer deporte para que otras personas supieran que se podía hacer deporte. Así que sí que es verdad que el hecho de ser conocida me ha impulsado a hacer más cosas de las que hubiese hecho seguramente. Porque yo quería mostrar a la gente que se podía esquiar. Y acabé enganchándome yo. Lo hice simplemente por un reportaje. "Venga venga, un reportaje y que la gente sepa que se puede". De hecho mi libro se llama Saber que se puede. Luego me enganché. Pero el hecho de ser relevante o conocida te impulsa a mostrar a otras personas un camino que puede ser muy beneficioso para ellos, y al final acabas tú enganchada.((WN)) : When all is said and done, what do you kind of want your legacy to be? Do you want to be known as Irene Villa, disability sport advocate figure? Do you want to be known like Jon Santacana, or do you want to be known as somebody who has pushed the boundaries in other areas?  ((es))Spanish language: ‍Al final del día, ¿qué clase de herencia desea dejar? ¿Ser conocida como Irene Villa, deportista y defensora del deporte discapacitado? ¿Ser conocida como Jon Santacana, o como alguien que ha forzado los límites en otras áreas?Irene Villa: As something more. I'd like my testimony to go beyond sport, which is what I try to do around the world, besides telling people you can do it. It's about the capacity of a person to make herself, to be happy, to overcome resentment, to love herself, and to love others. I think that is the most important thing. And that's the basis. I think sport is something that completes your life, mentally and physically. It's very important. But my message is forgiveness, happiness and hope. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Algo más. A mi me gustaría, que es lo que hago por todo el mundo, aparte de decir a la gente que se puede, que mi testimonio vaya más allá del deporte. Es la capacidad de una persona de hacerse a sí misma, de ser feliz, de superar el rencor, de amarse, y de amar a los demás. Yo creo que eso es lo más importante. Y esa es la base. Creo que el deporte es algo que completa tu vida, te complementa mentalmente, físicamente. Es muy importante. Pero mi mensaje es perdón, alegría y esperanza.((WN)) : Thank you very much! ((es))Spanish language: ‍¡Muchísimas gracias!London, England — Yesterday, following her team's 62–37 win over Mexico in the quarterfinals, Wikinews interviewed Katie Hill of Australia's women's national wheelchair basketball team.((Laura Hale))  Katie Hill, we know you've won a bronze medal before. What state are you from?Katie Hill: I'm from New South Wales.((WN))   Do you play for a club?KH: Yeah! I play for the Sydney Uni Flames.((WN))   You guys played Mexico in the lead up to this? KH:  Yeah.  We just had a tournament in the Netherlands, in Europe, and we got to play them there, which is good preparation.((WN))   You guys dominated in a painful way, embarrassingly for Mexico. You guys did a full court press and half court press and really jammed them up. Was that intentional?KH:  Of course! We had a strong game in our last game against the Netherlands, and obviously we're a bit fired up, and we want to be here so, you know, we want to play as strong as we can and prepare ourselves for the strongest teams that we can play. So, if we get to practice those kind of things and it works really well, then that's what we are aiming to do((WN))   You're going to meet either the USA or Canada. As an American, I find that terrifying. Do you guys think you have a real shot at the [semifinals]? KH:  Obviously, there's a lot of good teams in this competition. I think that anyone could win it on their day. As long as we're playing as well as we can, sure! Definitely!((WN))   You seemed to have all the answers to the Netherlands yesterday. Every tactic that they tried, you had a counterattack.KH:  They're a familiar team for us. We've been playing them for a while, and I think yesterday's win was probably the first time we've beaten them in quite a long time. So it was nice to finally make that happen now, and have that be a good win for us and put us in a good position.((WN))   Now's a good time to find real form.KH:  Exactly! So, we're saving it all up for when it counts!((WN))   You did really well in Sydney in that tournament. KH:  Yes.((WN))   You have that huge fan base with all those gliders shirts. How big a difference does it make on the court?KH:  Oh, it's unreal. It's amazing to come out. When you come out here, to many of the girls it's their first time out, and you come out and there's a whole big stadium full of people, all you want to do is find your family, and know where they're sitting, and sometimes that's really hard. So we've got them all in their yellow shirts and they're all sitting there so they're all recognisable and it just is amazing to feel so comfortable that all those people are behind you.((WN))   Who's here for you?KH:  I have my mum, my dad, my auntie, and also my dad's girlfriend is here as well.((WN))   Are you enjoying London, and the food and all?KH:  Yeah! This is the first time I've actually been to London. I've been through it a few times on our travels elsewhere, but it's been fantastic, and we're really enjoying it.((WN))   Do you plan to continue on to Rio? Or are you going to be like other Paralympians and retire on top?KH: I don't plan to retire any time soon. It's not like this is my last shot and then I'm going to have a rest. But I'm also focused on now and not really in four years time. I'll see how I'm going then. I like to play basketball so I'm not going to quit.((WN))   Thank you very much.London, England — Yesterday, Wikinews interviewed Michael Hartung, the Australian Deputy Chef de Mission at the Australian team quarters in the Paralympic Village.((Hawkeye7))  What does the Deputy Chef de Mission do?Michael Hartung: Makes the chef look good! (laughter) No, my role here is in support of our Chef de Mission and the team. There's two of us, myself, and Kate McLoughlin is the other Deputy Chef de Mission. She focuses on the operations side of things, the logistics and travel and all that sort of stuff, the foundations of preparing the team and really getting here and back home safely with all their gear. The part of the team that I look after is the performance side of things, so in my particular area I have guys in the sports science and sports medicine grew, which is managed by Alison Campbell. We have classification in my area which is managed by Geoff Han. We've got high performance and coach support, which is Chris Nunn, and the media guys fit under my side of things, and they are managed by Tim Mannion. All of those guys are all staff at the APC, and they've been working with us for a considerable amount of time. They are all experts in their areas so as far as the performance elements of the team are concerned we've got a great bunch of people that come in here and its a continuation of the the job that we prepare for and that we do every day. So that's been good, we're not a bunch of outsiders who've come together just for this team. We're professionals who work in these fields, doing these jobs day in and day out, so we should be experts when we get to the games in how it should be delivered.((LauraHale))  Is everything going according to plan for you guys? You've got more gold medals than you got in Beijing. Michael Hartung: Yep. Still not there yet in total but we're happy. Our goal coming into this, one main goal was to finish top five, and we're just hanging on. It's tough. That's the reality of Olympic sport. We're having a really good games at the moment. The sub goal of ours was to just beat the medal tally at Beijing which we've achieved on gold, which is terrific,  and we should achieve on total as well if things keep going the way they are for the next couple of days. That's a terrific result and it just shows the strength of the Paralympic movement, and the strength of our competitors  that there are so many nations fighting it out to be in that top five, and we're certainly not there by any means. The nation that's just behind us, the USA, is a traditional powerhouse of Paralympic sport, and a nation that has done extremely well over the history of Paralympic sport. So where we are right now is in a really good position and if we stay where we are now, and pick up a few more medals, we'll be really happy with the performance of the team and where it's gone on the medal tally.((LauraHale))  In the lead up to this there was a lot of coverage of how much money the government gave you for stuff like the recovery centre inside here. How fundamental has that government support been towards this?Michael Hartung: The Federal government provides us with basically all the funding that we give to the sport programs to deliver sport programs to athletes. And without the Federal government's support, we cannot do the job that we do. It is essential, and without their investment we certainly wouldn't be seeing the results that we have here. That been said we've also had great support in addition to funding from ministers and senators that have come across here and supported the team. Senator Kate Lundy is here. She's departing tonight, but has been here for most of the games. It's been terrific for us and the team to have had that sort of support for us here.((LauraHale))  Classification has been a big issue in these games. To an extent the Americans lost some... Oscar's classification's been a big deal... There hasn't been much Australian news related to classifications.Michael Hartung: No, which is a really good sign. I think that shows all the work we've put in over the years to classification. We've got a program that's been led by Jim MacMahon that we consider to be a world leading program. Which means that our policies and procedures and our work at a national level to ensure that people know where they fit in the classification spectrum, and no doubt early on is very important to us. So we minimise the risk of an athlete turning up and having a change in classification. This is really the Big Show. This is where it really matters, and for athletes to come here and not be 100% sure about their classification is something that we absolutely want to avoid. We should know where they sit, and there is a lot of money that is now invested through Federal funding and through the states' institutes and academies and so on. A lot of money gets invested and we need some surety about where that investment is going, and which athletes are prospects for medals when they turn up.((LauraHale))  We've talked to the Oceania people who've said they've got tremendous  support from the APC with the Wales thing. Are you guys going to continue to do that support? Because they couldn't say enough nice things about the APC and the coaches talking to their athletes. Michael Hartung: Yeah, that's terrific. I think that we certainly have an ongoing role that we have played and continue to play in Oceania in helping those countries really develop. New Zealand's doing great and they're certainly self-sufficient, and here as a great sporting nation, but for some of our other, smaller neighbors, it's great that we've been able to provide support. We've provided opportunities for them to come and be part of the Cardiff staging environment we set up for our team. We started preparations for that back in 2007. So they joined us there, and hopefully that's helped then achieve their great results here, with Fiji winning a gold medal. That's a tremendous achievement for Oceania as a whole, not just Fiji, and that's been terrific to know that the staging camp has assisted with that, along with the other support that we provide. We helped establish the Oceania Paralympic Committee not so long ago. We have Paul Bird, one of our Vice Presidents, as the President of the Oceania Paralympic Committee, and so we have a really close working relationship with those nations. It's terrific to see them succeed, and to be successful.((LauraHale))  Have you had a chance to see many of your athletes compete? And has there been any performance that has really stood out, Australian or not Australian?Michael Hartung: Yeah! I've been fortunate to see a lot of our guys compete, right across the board. There's many, many highlights for me. I don't think there's been one stand out performance. Natalie Smith getting a bronze medal to get us underway on the first day was such an incredible achievement, knowing where the shooting program was four or five years ago, not really being able to crack the medals, and to finally do it here in the first event, and to be the first medal was wonderful. Jacqui Freney's performances here to win seven gold medals has been amazing, and she's had a great meet here. Matt Cowdrey breaking the record and becoming the athlete to win the most gold medals for Australia has been a real achievement. But then seeing some of the things we've seen on the track and track cycling, Michael Gallagher and the other guys, they've had a great performance here at the games, incredibly well, and I think the most satisfying element of all of those performances is knowing the work that's gone into supporting those athletes from the the people around them, but the work that those individual athletes have put into achieving success, because coming here, you can see that this is an elite sporting environment,  and only the best in the world will achieve success, and you don't become the best by doing it half arsed; you have to give it 150%, and that's what it takes. No one wins unless they do that.((LauraHale))  Anything else that we should know?Michael Hartung: Apart from what we've just spoken about, I think that the London Organising Committee has done a terrific job with these games. They've made a sensational environment. Every games has its challenges, but the challenges here have been quite minor, and haven't caused any major disruptions. It enabled us to create an environment here which is really performance based. That's what the Australian Paralympic Committee is working on all the time is to create the best environment for our athletes. So that's been great. The crowds here have been tremendous and the support of the British public, and that started long ago with the acknowledgment of both Olympic and Paralympic. Whenever they say things, they say "Olympic and Paralympic". It's not been just about one games, primarily the Olympic Games or whatever, and that's been really good in terms of the psyche of the British people, because they know about Paralympic sport. They're a very knowledgeable audience, and that's been really great for the crowds here. They've cheered really loudly for the British athletes, but they've also been giving all the other athletes a big cheer as well, which is wonderful. And taking away from these games, the crowd, and the involvement and the support of all the athletes that have competed has been wonderful.Pro-wrestling, a sport derived from Greco-Roman freestyle wrestling, is often connected with the idea of sports-entertainment. Popularized by  Japanese and American federations (e.g. World Wrestling Entertainment, New Japan Pro Wrestling, etc.) the ongoing events and news are often discussed on the Internet. As such, television programs and other mass media focused on pro-wrestling are commonplace in Japan, America, and Europe.In Taiwan, fans do not simply watch the TV shows and discuss them via the Internet, but some of them participate in the sport of wrestling through communities from the Internet or colleges. Although a Taiwanese wrestler recently won a world-class pro-wrestling title, due to policies that focused only on promoting key athletic sports like baseball, billiards, basketball, and taekwondo (i.e. those with more possibilities to win a gold medal in the Asian Games or Olympics), governmental officials lost a great opportunity to promote sports like wrestling, which has many potential participants.What's the vision of wrestling in Taiwan? How did the communities drive TV spectators and wrestling fans and government officials pay more attention in wrestling? Is wrestling a future key sport in Taiwan? Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen visited the "2008 IWL Spring Festival", organised by a fan community and interviewed "Mr. Orange", well-known commentator of WWE TV shows broadcasted by VideoLand Max TV in Taiwan, to prospect the future of wrestling.Recently, Wikinews spent time with with New Zealand Paralympic skier Adam Hall who was at Copper Mountain, Colorado for the IPC Nor-Am Cup.((Wikinews))  We're interviewing famous Kiwi Paralympic legend Adam Hall, Paralympic skier. What classification are you?Adam Hall: An LW1.((WN))  LW1.  So you are a standing skier?Adam Hall: Stand up skier.((WN))  And how does a Kiwi end up skiing? Because it's not known as the world's greatest country for skiing. Adam Hall: Oh, actually we have quite a lot of good resources down in New Zealand for skiing and a lot of world class athletes and countries from all over the world come down to New Zealand and train during the off season. So, actually, kind of world-renowned for skiing.((WN))  New Zealand's had a couple of really famous skiers compared to their neighbour [Australia], right?Adam Hall: Yeah I guess so. Especially in the able bodied world. Back in the early 90s we had some good success at the Olympic medal.((WN))  You're the most decorated New Zealand Paralympian on the winter side?Adam Hall: Uh, no, not yet. We've also had a very successful Winter Paralympics ski racing team also in the 90s as well and also in the 80s as well when Paralympic skiing first evolved. We have had quite a successful team over the years, and we try to continue that[?].((WN))  Are you from the South Island?Adam Hall: From the South Island.((WN))  So you ski in Otago?Adam Hall: Yeah, I am from Otago and I train out of Wanaka.((WN))  After the Summer Olympics, your government had all sorts of budget issues. Has that impacted the Paralympic stuff on the winter side or in general, or is it just the Olympics where they are like "we don't want to fund everything"?  Adam Hall: I'd much rather stay out of all that political side of things, and I don't really know much about it...((WN))  They are giving you money to ski?Adam Hall: Based on your results you're pretty well supported, and you have to obviously show your results to get the kind of resources and help. If you're successful you're lucky enough to get world class resources to help you along.((WN))  Do you think you're better resourced than, say, the Americans?  Adam Hall: It's hard to say what each country gets, but I'm really happy and definitely privileged to have the support that I have behind me.((WN))  Are you going to go to Sochi?Adam Hall:  Definitely, yeah. That what my eyes are set on at the moment and it's for Sochi in 2014.((WN))  Have you qualified points-wise points already?Adam Hall:  Yeah, right now I have the qualifications and [?] points to qualify for the games.((WN))  What's your favourite skiing events? Adam Hall: Slalom and Super G, and the two combined.((WN))  It's because you like to go fast?Adam Hall:  I like to go fast and I like the technical things as well.((WN))  Anything that people should know about disability sport in New Zealand?Adam Hall: No, not really, the whole disability world, world-wide, is moving in a positive way and continues to when you look back in previous years with people with disabilities were kind of classed as second-hand[?] citizens and it is moving in a positive way and continues to.((WN))  Okay, cool.  Thank you very much.London, England — When Wikinews interviewed Oceania Paralympic Committee (OPC) President Paul Bird, the day before the start of this year's Summer Paralympics, he shared the idea that whilst Oceania may not be the first place one thinks of in connection with "Paralympics" or even "developing countries", Oceania is represented at the Games in London by athletes who have overcome many obstacles in order to compete.According to Bird, two athletes from Oceania are regarded as medal prospects. One, Fijian high-jumper Iliesa Delana, missed out in Beijing due to his event being cancelled. He is currently ranked number two in the world, having won silver at the World Championships. The other is Francis Kompaon, a sprinter from Rabaul in Papua-New Guinea competing in the 100 and 200 metre sprints.  These athletes qualified under the standard Paralympic processes. Other Oceania athletes are "wildcards", selected by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to broaden the number of nations taking part. Countries do not always get their preferred choices of wildcards; for a variety of reasons, the IPC may select a less-favoured athlete. In particular, women are more likely to be chosen to address the games' gender imbalance.It's not easy being an athlete, or an official, from a developing country says Bird. Often people are confronted with a host of unfamiliar situations. For example: many of the required forms are now online; officials with little technology experience have to navigate an unfamiliar landscape of browsers, buttons and passwords.The OPC consists of eight countries: Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Papua-New Guinea. Papua-New Guinea and Samoa are sending two athletes each to the London Games. Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands are sending one each. Bird says, in attempting to promote Paralympic sport in Oceania, the region's Paralympic Committee puts a priority on training local officials, coaches and classifiers. This helps member countries conduct their own events, without assistance from Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, the Committee organizes the Arafura Games, a regional competition.Countries in the region are encouraged by the OPC to assemble teams, get athletes into work rankings, and plan ahead for the 2016 Paralympics to be held in Rio. Efforts are being made to strengthened ties between the region and international bodies such as the International Tennis Federation.Bird, as head of the OPC, has been a member of the Australian Paralympic Committee since 1993. He won gold and silver medals in swimming at the 1984 Paralympics where he was the Australian Team Captain. He was the Australian Chef de Mission in Sydney in 2000 and Athens in 2004, and the Assistant Chef de Mission in Barcelona in 1992, Atlanta in 1996, and Beijing in 2008. He also currently sits on the Australian Paralympic Committee's board.With the United States Australian rules football National Championship this weekend, Wikinews interviewed United States Australian Football League (USFooty) president Rich Mann, and Media Relations representative Kevin Smith.The USAFL Nationals will feature teams from the United States and Canada. A 50/50 rule is being implemented for the tournament. This means that an American team can have no more than nine players who aren't Americans and a Canadian team no more than nine non-Canadians.Australian rules football is played on a field 170 metres by 160 metres. The two teams consist of 18 players a side. Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total).According to USFooty, the tournament will attract over 1000 players. The tournament will have four divisions for men and one for woman.Zaragoza, Spain — On Thursday, Wikinews traveled to Zaragoza, Spain to interview the nation's most decorated Paralympian and IPC Athlete Council representative Teresa Perales. A wide range of topics about the Paralympics and sport in Spain were discussed including the evolution of Paralympic sport, disability sport classification, funding support across all levels of elite sport including the Paralympics and Olympics, the role of sportspeople in politics, sponsorship issues, and issues of gender in Spanish sport.Earlier today, Wikinews interviewed Spanish para-alpine LW2 clasffied skier Úrsula Pueyo during a delay in the slalom event at the IPC Alpine World Championships at La Molina, Spain. Pueyo is the only woman on the Spanish 2013 World Championship team, and was the only female Spanish standing skier at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Following the interview, event organizers announced the slalom had been cancelled for the day due to high winds and was rescheduled for tomorrow.((Wikinews)) : Hello, we are with Úrsula Pueyo. Today is the slalom race. What are your sensations for the day? ((es))Spanish language: ‍Hola estamos con Úrsula Pueyo en el día del eslalon. ¿Qué tal son tus sensaciones para el día de hoy?Úrsula Pueyo: Well, to be honest, my sensations for today are better than ever. I've been feeling really good while skiing, I am looking forward to competing, and I'm liking the slopes. The only thing is, let's see if the weather will allow it. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Bueno, la verdad es que mis sensaciones hoy son mejor que nunca. Me estoy encontrando muy bien esquiando, tengo muchas ganas y me está gustando la pista. Lo único que a ver, porque a ver si el tiempo lo permite.((WN)) : Right, because the weather today is giving us a surprise... Let's hope you can compete later. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Sí, porque el clima hoy está deparando una sorpresa un poco... esperemos que se pueda competir después.Úrsula Pueyo: Yes. Really, the race started, twelve competitors managed to go out and get times, and I had number 19 and I was left at the gate waiting to go. [Laughs] ((es))Spanish language: ‍Sí. La verdad que ha empezado la carrera, doce dorsales ya han salido así que ya están los tiempos marcados, y yo salía con el dorsal 19 y me he quedado en el portillón esperando. [Risas].((WN)) : How do you see yourself for Sochi [Winter Paralympics Games of 2014], in this last event before it? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Cómo te ves de cara a Sochi, en esta última prueba antes de Sochi?Úrsula Pueyo: Well, today's the slalom, and on Tuesday and Wednesday the giant, so I hope to get other races in before Sochi [Laughs], but yeah, really looking forward to this one. And whatever comes next, will come. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Bueno, hoy es el eslalon, y el martes y el miércoles tenemos el gigante, y espero poder hacer otras carreras antes de Sochi [Risas], pero sí que es verdad que bueno, con muchas ganas de esta. Y luego lo que venga ya vendrá.((WN)) : You're the only woman in the Spanish team. Is that an issue ever for you? Is it different, challenging, being the only woman? Is gender an issue in women's skiing? ((es))Spanish language: ‍Es la única mujer en el equipo español. ¿Es diferente, un desafío, ser la única mujer? ¿Importa el género en el esquí femenino?Úrsula Pueyo: Yes, I mean it's not a problem in the Spanish team. Four men and a lone woman. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Sí. Quiero decir, no es problema en el eqiupo español. Cuatro hombres y solamente una mujer.((WN)) : Do you think the level of the women's skiing is the same level as the men's? ((es))¿Piensa que el nivel del esquí femenino es igual que el masculino?: ‍{{{4}}}Úrsula Pueyo: Yes! The same. Maybe the men have more speed, but the technical level is the same. ((es))Spanish language: ‍¡Sí! El mismo. Puede que los hombres tengan más velocidad, pero técnicamente el nivel es el mismo.((WN)) : Thank you very much! ((es))Spanish language: ‍¡Muchas gracias!Last Friday at Madrid–Barajas Airport, Wikinews interviewed Spanish Paralympic swimmer Deborah Font, who is competing at the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships that started this Monday in Montreal, Canada.  Font has finished second in Monday's Women's 100 meter Freestyle S12 Heat 1, before going on to finish fourth in the Women's 100 meter Freestyle S12 Final with a time of 1:03.20, less than a second behind bronze medalist German Naomi Maike Schnittger.((Wikinews))   I'm Laura Hale, I'm interviewing Deborah Font for Wikinews. Deborah is going to the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships in Montreal. You're already a Paralympic medallist, right? You've won several medals at the Paralympics before?Deborah Font: I won two medals in Sydney [2000 Summer Paralympic Games], a gold medal and bronze medal; in Athens [2004 Summer Paralympic Games] two silver medals and one bronze medal; in Beijing [2008 Summer Paralympic Games] one bronze medal; and in London [2012 Summer Paralympic Games] one bronze medal. Seven in Paralympic Games.((WN))  And in World Championships?Deborah Font: I don't know the exact number. Several.((WN))  What style do you swim?Deborah Font: 400m freestyle.((WN))  Okay, and you're going to do that in Montreal?Deborah Font: In Montreal I'll do 400m freestyle.((WN))  You think you're going to get a medal?Deborah Font: Yes, I'm fighting for a silver or bronze medal.((WN))  What classification are you?Deborah Font: S-12.((WN))  S-12. So you have partial vision.Deborah Font: Yeah, partial. [I can see a little.]((WN))  Since you cannot see perfectly, when you swim, can you see the people next to you?Deborah Font: I can see those next to me, but not perfectly. I see those near to me, but not those far from me.((WN))  Do you think about other swimmers when you swim, or is it a disadvantage because you cannot see swimmers farther away?Deborah Font: I swim my race, and don't see the other swimmers.((WN))  They don't matter when you swim? You swim against yourself, your best time?Deborah Font: I swim against myself, I don't see the other swimmers too much. My race, myself, I go inside myself.((WN))  Do you have any sponsors?Deborah Font: No, no sponsors.((WN))  How difficult is it to swim in Spain for Paralympic swimmers when you don't have sponsors?Deborah Font: We have a Paralympic Committee. It's difficult having sponsors in Spain. For the Olympics, athletes don't have many sponsors, and for Paralympics it's more difficult.((WN))  Where are you from?Deborah Font: Barcelona.((WN))  Is swimming more competitive in Barcelona, in Madrid...? Where do you think the best swimmers come from?Deborah Font: They come from all Spain, but train only in Madrid or Barcelona. Most in Barcelona. (laughs)((WN))  Is there a reason most of the swimmers train in Barcelona?Deborah Font: There are more possibilities for training in good swimming pools. The "Centros de Alto Rendimiento" [High Performance Centres] are in Madrid or Barcelona.((WN))  Coming in into the World Championships, did you do any special training, or change how you prepare?Deborah Font: I did special training with a coach that only trains three or four of us at the High Performance Centre. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Entrenamos con entrenador especial que por ejemplo él solo nos entrena a tres o cuatro paralímpicos, en el Centro de Alto Rendimiento pero con un entrenador especial que nos sigue a diario y que nos lo hace especialmente para nosotros.((WN))  This is a pretty dumb question, but I know a lot of people who look at blind swimmers and they go how can they swim at a straight line? Can you clarify how people with vision impairments can actually swim?Deborah Font: Well, in swimming it's all technique and a lot of learning, and learning to swim by the middle of the lane involves a lot of training, habit... Perhaps it's more difficult for completely blind people, but it's all a matter of training, trying again and again, get to know the swimming pool... But I think the most difficult thing is to learn to swim the technique without being able to see the others, and to know what you are moving, your arm here and not there... and learning to touch the wall, it's harder to calculate, especially when competing, because you cannot see the distance you have to the wall. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Bueno, para nadar casi todo es técnica y mucho aprendizaje, y para nadar recto en la calle es por entrenamiento, por costumbre, por... quizás es más dicifil cuando se es ciego total ir por el medio justo, pero bueno todo está entrenado, es a base de entrenar, intentarlo, conocerte la piscina... Pero creo que lo más dificil es aprender a nadar la técnica sin ver a los demás, y saber lo que estás moviendo, el brazo, y si lo pones aquí, no lo pones aquí, pues eso sí, y llegar a la pared también, es como más dificil de calcular, sobre todo en competición, que no ves la pared a la distancia que estás.((WN))  Thank you very much!Thursday at Madrid–Barajas Airport, Wikinews interviewed Spanish Paralympic swimmer Marta Gomez, who is scheduled to compete at the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships that start on Monday in Montreal, Canada.((Wikinews))   This is Laura Hale, I'm interviewing Marta Gómez, a Spanish Paralympic swimmer going to the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships in Montreal. Are you going to Montreal and what strokes and distances are you competing in?Marta Gomez : I'll swim the 100 meter and 400 freestyle, and the 200 individual medley. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Voy a nadar los 100 [metros] y 400 libres, y los 200 estilo giro.((WN))  Have you won any medals at previous championships? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Vas a ganar alguna medalla?Marta Gomez : In 2011, at the European Championships in Berlin, I won 3 bronze. ((es))Spanish language: ‍En Europeo 2011, en Berlín, gané 3 bronces.((WN))  Do you think you will win any medals in Montreal? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Tienes medalla en Montreal?Marta Gomez : I will try to fight for a medal in the 400 freestyle which is my main event, but, well, [if I swim well and feel well] my options are clearer, but until you swim nothing is clear. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Voy a intentar luchar por la medalla en el 400 libres que es mi prueba principal, pero bueno, hay que ¿sentir? y nadarlos; la ¿? serán mis opciones más claras, pero hasta que no se nade no hay nada claro.((WN))  You've competed at previous Paralympic Games? In London?Marta Gomez : Yes. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Sí.((WN))  And you didn't win any medals?Marta Gomez : No, I didn't win any medals. ((es))Spanish language: ‍No. Fui de cima en Londres.((WN))  What's the difference preparing for London to the World Championships? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Cuál es la diferencia de la preparación para Londres para el Campeonato del Mundo?Marta Gomez : That I have improved many aspects of technical level [like?] performance, and especially the psychological aspect that after London I have faced other competitions and I feel much more confident about myself and I have become more competitive. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Que yo he mejorado muchos aspectos tanto a nivel de técnica como de rendimiento, y sobre todo el aspecto psicológico que a raíz de Londres he afrontado las competiciones de otra manera y me siento mucho más segura de mí misma y me he vuelto más competitiva.((WN))  Are you a swimmer with a visual impediment? You cannot see...? ((es))Spanish language: ‍-¿De qué categoría eres?Marta Gomez : S13. ((es))Spanish language: ‍S13.((WN))  When you swim, can you see the swimmers next to you? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Cuando nadas, se puede ver a los nadadores a tu lado?Marta Gomez : Depending on the race, you will always be able to — some races like in short distances like the 100 meter breaststroke and 100 meter freestyle as it is too short to lose sight of your rivals, but for example in 400 meters, yes, but I can only see from the sides. I cannot see all the swimmers. In the 800 meters, seeing swimmers in the race is impossible: I fail to see them. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Depende de la prueba, siempre va... la de velocidad en pruebas cortas... por ejemplo en 100 [metros] brazas y 100 libres al ser tan cortas no vas tan pendiente de los rivales, pero por ejemplo en 400 sí que puedo ver más pero solamente a las que tengo a los lados, no puedo ver a todas las nadadoras, a las 8 nadadoras de la serie es imposible, no alcanzo a verlas.((WN))  When you swim, do you mostly think about your own race because you cannot fully see everyone? Do you race more against yourself because you can not see? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Nadas más contigo misma o por no poder ver? ¿más tu prueba?Marta Gomez : Yes, of course. Not being able to see your rivals you have to concentrate on your event because you may have nobody to [watch?], you may have a slight reference but you have to swim against yourself. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Sí, claro. Al no poder ver a las rivales te tienes que ¿dedicar? a hacer tu prueba porque no tienes a lo mejor a nadie en quién fijarte, puedes tener una ligera referencia pero tienes que nadar tu prueba y nadar contigo misma.((WN))  Why did you choose swimming as opposed to athletics or Goalball or some other sport?Marta Gomez : I have only practiced swimming since childhood, I've always liked the water and it's been the only sport I've practiced because I think it's a sport where you feel a lot of freedom and don't have any architectural barriers or anything. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Yo solo he practicado la natación desde pequeña, siempre me ha gustado mucho el agua y ha sido el único deporte que he practicado porque me parece un deporte en que sientes mucha libertad y no tienes ningún tipo de barreras arquitectónicas ni nada.((WN))  Gracías. ((en))Spanish language: ‍Thank you.Marta Gomez : De nada. ((en))Spanish language: ‍You're welcome.Thursday at Madrid–Barajas Airport, Wikinews interviewed Spanish Paralympic swimmer María Delgado, who is scheduled to compete at the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships that start on Monday in Montreal, Canada. Delgado will be 15 when she is to compete in Montreal.((Wikinews))  I'm Laura Hale, I'm interviewing María Delgado who is a Spanish swimmer and who is going to the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships in Montreal, and you have received a lot of press attention from the Spanish press for being the next great Spanish Swimmer, [...] [Do you expect to medal in this tournament or in Río?] ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Crees que en este campeonato vas a ganar una medalla o futuro a Río?  [Note: The translated question here differed from the one originally asked in English.]María Delgado: [laughs] I don't know. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Yo qué sé jajaja.((WN))  The Spanish newspapers say she is the greatest swimmer, she is the next greatest Spanish Paralympic swimmer. Does she feel pressure from the media saying that she is a great swimmer to perform in a really high level? Does she feel pressure to win because the newspapers say it? Spanish newspapers say she is the next great Spanish Paralympic swimmer, that she is going to go to Río.Translator: She has also been future with "plan AXA", who bet on young swimmers Paralympics, and has been going at concentrations, which are younger with future have driven a little to fit in the world level of competition. ((es))Spanish language: ‍ ¿si tienes algún [here I'd say: "alguna presión porque"] ... como que eres el futuro porque eres nueva nadadora, si has salido por ejemplo en el periódico en tu pueblo? Bueno, ella ha sido una apuesta también de un plan que hay de AXA, que apuestan por los jóvenes nadadores paralímpicos, y ha estado yendo a concentraciones, a los que son más jovenes con futuro los han impulsado un poquito para que entren en el mundo de la competición a nivel.María Delgado: I'm on a plan for young talent, that is preparing for Rio 2016 and has selected us, and now we go to the World Championship. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Estoy en un plan que es de jóvenes promesas, que nos preparan para Río 2016 y ha apostado por nosotros, y ahora vamos al campeonato del mundo.((WN))  Because you are 15, how do you [...] balance going to school and competing?María Delgado: It's a little difficult but with hard work and effort it's doable. Study in the morning and train in the afternoon. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Es un poco difícil pero con trabajo y esfuerzo se puede conseguir. Estudio por la mañana y entreno por la tarde.((WN))   Are you doing school work while you are in Montreal? How does you balance school? How do you do the school at the 15 years old and swim? Because that seems really hard to do both at once. ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Estás haciendo las tareas escolares mientras se encuentra en Montreal? ¿De qué manera a equilibrar la escuela? ¿Cómo se hace la escuela a los 15 años de edad y nadar? Debido a que parece muy difícil hacer las dos cosas a la vez. ¿Puedes explicar como por ejemplo qué ¿? vas a hacerlo todo normal, no? Que ¿cómo lo compaginas? Que es muy difícil compaginar y entrenar a la vez natación, o sea, nadar y estudiar.María Delgado:  It is very difficult to combine and train while swimming, with swimming and studying. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Sí, es difícil pero se puede cerrar y hay veces que no sé cómo lo hago... estudiando, yo qué sé... Nos explica por ejemplo que en la Universidad pues tienes que ir más ¿? ... start very new... que acaba de empezar y todavía no trae ritmo.((WN))  Because you're 15 do your parents go with you? Are your parents going to Montreal or are you all traveling solo by yourself?María Delgado: With my coaches. My parents aren't going. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Con mis entrenadores. Mis padres no van.((WN))  Only with your coach? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Sólo con su entrenador?María Delgado: Yes. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Sí.((WN))  Is it scary to be on your own? Competing against all these 20 year olds and 30 year olds who've been to Paralympic games, or you just go "I'm 15, I can — el Mundo es mío [the world is mine]"? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Tienes miedo o tú vas con todas las ganas de competir con gente mayor?María Delgado: I'm not scared and I go eagerly. ((es))Spanish language: ‍No tengo miedo y voy con muchas ganas.((WN))  Thank you. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Gracias.With the IPC Athletics World Championships scheduled to start this Friday, Wikinews interviewed Spanish T12 classified long distance runner Alberto Suárez Laso at Madrid–Barajas Airport Monday before he departed for Lyon, France. Suárez is scheduled to compete in two events, the T12 5,000 meters and marathon events.((Wikinews))  Hi this is Laura Hale. I'm interviewing Alberto Suárez, who is a visually-impaired runner competing for Spain in the IPC World Championships. What events are you doing? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿En qué eventos estás?Alberto Suárez Laso : Marathon and 5000m. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Maratón y 5000m.((WN))   You have a World Record? Are you going to smash it and give Spain a gold medal? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Vas a romper el record mundial y darle a España un oro?Alberto Suárez Laso: This time it's a bit complicated because I'm going a bit injured. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Esta vez está un poco complicado porque voy un poco lesionado((WN))  Ah. You finished second in London [the 2012 Summer Paralympics]? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Terminaste segundo en Londres?Alberto Suárez Laso : I finished first.((WN))  The injury has impacted you training? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿La lesión ha perjudicado tu entrenamiento?Alberto Suárez Laso : For the last three weeks I've been doing gym and walking machine only. I have pain in my Achilles tendon. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Llevo tres semanas solo con gimnasio y elíptica. Tengo dolor en el tendón de Aquiles.((WN))   So, as someone who writes from an international perspective,  do you think Spain's got all that stuff to help you properly? The medical support, stuff to help you recuperate and be a great runner?Alberto Suárez Laso : I hope so. We're there, they've been treating me very well and I hope to be able to run without pain, which is the most important thing. I've got the training, but I need to remove that pain. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Espero que sí. Estamos ahí, me están tratando bastante bien y espero correr sin dolor, que es lo fundamental. La preparación la tengo, pero hay que quitar ese dolor.((WN))  Do you run with a guide?Alberto Suárez Laso : No.((WN))  Okay, so are you T-13?Alberto Suárez Laso : T-12.((WN))   Oh. So it's optional for a guy at T-12?Translator : He could, but he's not too badly impaired. He can run by himself.((WN))  So is your preference to run without a guide?Alberto Suárez Laso : It's complicated because of the pace I run at. I would require several guides, and it's hard to find them. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Es una complicación por el ritmo al que corro. Necesitaría varios guías y es dificil conseguirlos.((WN))  Do most of your competitors run with guides? Alberto Suárez Laso : Not among the first ones. Well, there are a couple that do run with guides, but the rest don't. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Los primeros no. Bueno, hay un par de ellos que corren con guía, los demás no.((WN))   Is there anything you would like to say about this competition coming up that people from an international sporting community would find valuable to know?Alberto Suárez Laso : Mm, I don't know what to say!((WN))   Okay. Thank you very much! ((es))Spanish language: ‍¡Muchas gracias!Alberto Suárez Laso : You're welcome! ((es))Spanish language: ‍De nada.With the IPC Athletics World Championships scheduled to start Friday (today), Wikinews interviewed Spanish  athlete David Casinos at Madrid–Barajas Airport Monday before he departed for Lyon, France.((Wikinews))   Hello I'm interviewing David Casinos, Spain's most famous track and field athlete in Paralympic sport, for Wikinews. So you're competing at the IPC World Championships are going to win a whole lot of medals? Which medals are you going to win?David Casinos :Well, I'd like above all to perform well, because it would mean I'd be closer to the medals. I'm humble in that sense. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Bueno, me gustaría sobre todo, primero hacerlo bien, eso significaría que voy a acercarme a esas medallas. Soy muy humilde en ese aspecto.((WN))   As somebody who's been competing a long time in track and field, how has stuff changed form when you first started out to now?David Casinos: The biggest change I've seen has been with regards to media, communication, but above all the Plan ADO Paralympic. The professionalization of Plan ADO, becoming professional sportspeople. Spanish Paralympic sports is now more known to the media and in the world. ((es))Spanish language: ‍El mayor cambio que he vivido yo ha sido la comunicación, pero sobre todo el Plan ADO Paralímpico. Profesionalizar el Plan ADO. Ser deportistas profesionales. El deporte paralímpico español es más conocido ahora por los medios de comunicación y en el mundo entero.((WN))   Have there been more opportunities for sponsorship as your Paralympics profile has grown?David Casinos:  Yes!((WN))   Would you like to promote a few of them?David Casinos: I've got several sponsors, one of them is Toro Loco, an energy drink, there's also Diputación de Valencia, Fundación Trinidad Alfonso, from Juan Roig, Mercadona, Moncada which is my townhall, Valencia Terra i Mar... I may be forgetting one of them now. I've got several. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Tengo bastantes patrocinadores, uno de ellos es Toro Loco, una bebida energética, Diputación de Valencia, Fundación Trinidad Alfonso, que es de Juan Roig, Mercadona, Moncada, mi ayuntamiento, Valencia Terra i Mar... Igual me olvido de alguno ahora. Tengo varios.((WN))   In London one of the Australians said that it was time for athletics in the Paralympics to be able to become more professional and get shoe sponsorship. Do you know if any of the Spanish ones are covering shoe logos if they don't have sponsorship?  [Editor's note: here the translator asked a different question in Spanish, about whether shoe brands were helping athletes.] ((es))Spanish language: ‍Resulta que los australianos han hecho que los patrocinadores patrocinen sus zapatos. ¿Esto pasa en los atletas españoles también?David Casinos: No. This does not happen. ((es))Spanish language: ‍No. No sucede.((WN))   Is this going to be an issue? I mean is Spain at the level where it can become an issue?David Casinos: I for example have a big sponsor, Italian Macron Sports, which also sponsors the Italian and Spanish Leagues of soccer. So I don't have that problem. I feel very supported. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Yo por ejemplo tengo un patrocinador muy grande, se llama Macrón Sports, italiano, y es patrocinador de la liga italiana, la española, de fútbol, y yo tengo su patrocinador. Yo no tengo ese problema. Me siento muy arropado.((WN))   Okay. So, you're a visual-impaired athlete, and do you run with a guide?David Casinos: I don't run with one, but I do need a guide to do series, jump, to do everything I need to do in training to throw very far. ((es))Spanish language: ‍No corro con un guía, pero sí necesito a ese guía para hacer series, saltar, hacer todo lo que tengo que hacer, para lanzar lejos.((WN))  How helpful are guides in terms of how much they potentially impact outcomes, do you think?David Casinos: For me the guide is a basic component of my daily work. When competing, they simply help you to get in and out of the field, and you do the rest, but in a daily basis what I call the backstage, the guide helps you with the weights, jumps, positions. There's more work even, behind the competition scenes. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Para mi el guía es una pieza fundamental en mi día a día. En la competición simplemente te ayudan a entrar y salir del círculo, lo demás lo haces tú, pero en el día a día, en el backstage que le digo yo, es el que te ayuda con las pesas, a saltar, acolocarte en el foso, hay más trabajo incluso, detrás de la competición.((WN))   Spain has a long history of blind sports, compared to other countries. Do you have an explanation as to why there are so many blind athletes?David Casinos: Well, above all we have ONCE, the organization greatly responsible for disabled people having available a series of options, including sports. And in that respect ONCE has been very pioneering. Absolutely pioneering. And that's good. What's happening now is that other countries are discovering their Paralympians. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Bueno, en primer lugar tenemos la organización ONCE, que es la gran precursora de que las personas con discapacidad tengamos una serie de opciones, entre ellas el deporte. Y en ese aspecto ha sido la ONCE muy pionera. Pioneros absolutos. Y eso es bueno. Lo que pasa es que ahora otros países están descubriendo sus paralímpicos.((WN))  Is there anything you think an international audience should know about you or the Paralympic movement in Spain?David Casinos: I'm just another sportsperson who fights for his dream, which is sports, to surpass myself, day after day, after having a great challenge which was losing my sight. And that is the message I like to transmit to people through coaching. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Soy un deportista más, que lucha por mi sueño, que es el deporte, superarme, día a día, después de una gran dificultad que ha sido perder la visión. Y este mensaje es el que me gusta transmitir a muchas personas mediante el coaching.((WN))   Okay. ¡Muchas gracias!David Casinos:  Okay!With the IPC Athletics World Championships scheduled to start this Friday, Wikinews interviewed Spanish T12 classified long distance runner Elena Congost Mohedano at Madrid–Barajas Airport Monday before he departed for Lyon, France. Congost is scheduled to compete in  the T12 1500 meters.((Wikinews))  Hello, I'm interviewing Elena Congost Mohedano who is a Spanish Paralympic athlete who won a silver in London and is going to Lyon to compete in the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships. Having won a medal in London are you going to get another one in this one?Elena Congost Mohedano : Yes! I train all year to go to win a medal.((WN))  Which medal?Elena Congost Mohedano:  Gold! (laughs)((WN))   Which event?Elena Congost Mohedano:  In 1500m.((WN))   So you're a long distance runner. And you don't train/run with a guide because you're, what, T-13?Elena Congost Mohedano: I'm T-12.((WN))   Ah. So you have a degenerative eye disease, so your vision is getting worse?  ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Tu visión empeora?Elena Congost Mohedano:  Yes.((WN))    Do you expect it to get much worse over your continued history competing?Elena Congost Mohedano: Now it's stalled, but next year it's possible.((WN))  Do you plan to stick since you've been competing since 2002, right...?Elena Congost Mohedano: Yes, [Unintelligible].((WN))  Do you plan to continue running until 2020 if Madrid gets the Games?Elena Congost Mohedano: I don't know. (laughs) First 2016 in Rio, and then... I don't know.((WN))  There's so few women competing for Spain. Is that an additional challenge as an athlete in this country?Elena Congost Mohedano: No... In this country there are more girls in 100m, 200m and long jump. More people. In middle distance no. Two, three, four girls only.((WN))  Why do you think there's so few women on the Spanish team? It's like 27 total Spanish competing, and there's like [three] women?Elena Congost Mohedano:  I don't know... The level is high internationally, but in Spain... no more level.((WN))  Someone with a visual impairement, there's a lot of sports you could do?Elena Congost Mohedano:  The people now are very lazy. (laughs) No one runs. (laughs)((WN))   With so many sporting opportunities for people with vision impairments in Spain, why did you choose track and field?Elena Congost Mohedano:  When I was young, my dream was to become an athlete. I saw them in tv, in races, and I told my parents "my wish is to win a gold medal in the Olympics!"((WN))  Is there any particular athlete you remember from when you were young being particularly inspiring?Elena Congost Mohedano:  No.((WN))   Spain has these really distinctive uniforms. The colors... Do people ever comment to you about them? Because in the US they were like, "your uniforms look like McDonald's!" ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Hay alguien que ha dicho algo de lo que es el color y tal, porque por lo visto en EE.UU dicen que son como McDonalds.Elena Congost Mohedano: (laughs) In London, everyone said they were not good... They said we looked like clowns. But this one now is...redder. Better.((WN))   As somebody who's been competing for more than ten years, has there been a big change in the Paralympic movement from your perspective?Elena Congost Mohedano: Yes! Every year the level is higher. In the Paralympics, every four years I increase my performance level.((WN))  Do you think that the increased competition has made you a better athlete?Elena Congost Mohedano:  Yes! Yes.((WN))   Thank you very much!Elena Congost Mohedano:  Okay!With the IPC Athletics World Championships scheduled to start this Friday, Wikinews interviewed Spanish T12 classified long distance runner Gustavo Nieves Campello at Madrid–Barajas Airport yesterday before he departed for Lyon, France. Nieves is scheduled to compete in two events, the T12 5,000 and 10,000 meter events.((Wikinews))  Hello this is Laura Hale, I'm interviewing Gustavo Nieves Campello for English Wikinews. You're competing at the IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon. What events?Gustavo Nieves Campello : 5000m and 10000m.((WN))  And are you one of Spain's medal favorites?Gustavo Nieves Campello : Not...really. Bronze medal, maybe. It's difficult. The African runners are very good.((WN))  Do you think coming from Spain and competing in Europe you have an advantage over the Africans who have to travel more? ((es))Spanish language: ‍Si crees que siendo de España, bueno de Europa, y compites con los africanos, ¿eres favorito?Gustavo Nieves Campello : No, I don't think I am a favorite.((WN))  Who else are you competing with? Are there any Australians or New Zealanders you have to beat to have to come longer? ((es))Spanish language: ‍Si tienes que ganar a un australiano o algún neozelandés o algo.Gustavo Nieves Campello : No, there are no Australians in the event.((WN))   You're vision-impaired? Do you run with a guide?Gustavo Nieves Campello : Yes, and no.((WN))  So how bad is your vision in terms of impacting your running compared to people who've got full sight? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Cómo de mala es tu visión comparada con las personas que tienen visión perfecta?Gustavo Nieves Campello : Blurry vision and tunnel vision. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Visión borrosa y poco campo visual((WN))  You lost your sight at 17? Really suddenly? You did Athletics before? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Cuándo empezó? ¿A los 17?Gustavo Nieves Campello : Yes, at 17. Before I played football.((WN))  Oh, that's right, you considered becoming a pro football player. And you never considered five-a-side football? Gustavo Nieves Campello : No, no. I began to run and here I am.((WN))  Thank you very much!Gustavo Nieves Campello : Thank you.This week, Wikinews interviewed Spanish Paralympic sport shooter Paulo Fontán Torreiro.  Late last month, Galician Fontán competed at the Alicante hosted 2013 IPC European Shooting Championship, where he finished twenty-third in the R4 10-meter air rifle standing event, and fortieth in the R5 10-meter air rifle prone event.((Wikinews)) : So you competed at the IPC European Shooting Championships last month?  How did you do? Are you happy with the result? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Compitió en el pasado Campeonato de Europa de Tiro? ¿Qué tal le fue? ¿Satisfecho por el resultado?Paulo Fontán Torreiro: Yes, I competed in the European Championship in Alicante. It was my first important event and I felt very nervous, I wanted to perform well. Despite improving my previous scores and achieving the minimum qualifying score for next year's World Championship, I think I could have done better. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Si he competido en el cto de Europa de Alicante. Era mi primer campeonato de tanta importancia y me noté bastante nervioso, con ganas de hacerlo bien. Aunque he mejorado mis marcas anteriores y he conseguido las marcas mínimas para tener la posibilidad de participar en el campeonato del mundo del año que viene, si es cierto que considero que lo debí haber hecho algo mejor.((WN)) : What do you think you need to improve to possibly compete at the 2016 Rio Paralympics and get a medal? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Qué cree que necesita mejorar para poder competir en los Juegos Paralímpicos de Rio en 2016 y ganar una medalla?Paulo Fontán: Basically I would need to be able to train more constantly, obtain financial resources to participate in international events, and have a bit of luck on the day of the competition. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Fundamentalmente necesitaría poder entrenar con más constancia, conseguir recursos económicos para poder participar en competiciones internacionales y despues tener algo de suerte el día de la competición.((WN)) : What are the biggest challenges you face on the road to the Rio Games?  Money?  Good competition?  The support network to travel and compete at the highest level?  Disability access at training venues? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Cuáles son los mayores desafíos a los que se enfrenta en el camino a los Juegos de Rio? ¿Presupuesto? ¿Buenos rivales para aumentar su nivel? ¿Una red de apoyo para viajar y competir al máximo nivel? ¿Acceso para discapacitados en lugares de entrenamiento?Paulo Fontán: All that are included in the questions. In order to train effectively, you need adequate facilities, and that's not the norm here. And to increase my level, I would need to compete against good rivals, basically at international events. For that, I require money and support, something that's not too available. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Pues todos los que aparecen en las preguntas. Para entrenar con garantías hace falta contar con instalaciones adecuadas, y no es lo habitual. Y para mejorar mi nivel necesitaría competir con buenos rivales (basicamente en competiciones internacionales) y para ello hace falta dinero y apoyos, algo que escasea.((WN)) : Why did you chose to compete in shooting?  Why not compete in another sport? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Por qué eligió competir en tiro? ¿Por qué no otro deporte?Paulo Fontán: I first tried other sports but finally focused on shooting because it fits my capabilities better, I'm not bad at it, and there is a very agreeable atmosphere at the competitions. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Probé primero otros deportes pero finalmente me he centrado en el tiro porque se ajusta mejor a mis capacidades, no se me da mal y he respirado un ambiente muy agradable en las competiciones.((WN)) : Who are your role models in shooting?  Are there any shooters you particularly admire? ((es))Spanish language: ‍   ¿Quién es su modelo a seguir en tiro? ¿Existen tiradores/as a los que particularmente admire?Paulo Fontán: I must thank the support Juan Saavedra has given me since I started, and which he keeps giving me when I need it. I would like to mention Marciano Vázquez, the Spanish national team coach, too for his advice and trust in me when he called me up for the European Championship: I hope to return his trust with some future triumph. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Tengo que agradecer el apoyo que siempre me ha brindado Juan Saavedra desde que empecé, y que me sigue brindando cuando lo necesito. Citar también a Marciano Vázquez, seleccionador nacional de Tiro Olímpico, por sus consejos y por su confianza en mi persona a la hora de convocarme para el cto de Europa; espero poder devolverle la confianza con algún éxito futuro.((WN)) : What is the sport shooting culture like in Spain?  Are people generally supportive when you tell them what sport you compete in? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Cómo es recibido este deporte culturalmente en España? ¿La gente le apoya cuando dice que es tirador?Paulo Fontán: I don't think it's very well known, and there could be some rejection because of the "pegar tiros" part, but that's out of ignorance since it is mainly a mental sport, a sport requiring focus. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Creo que no es muy conocido y quizá pueda haber cierto rechazo por eso de "pegar tiros" pero es fruto del desconocimiento ya que fundamentaolmente es un deporte mental, de concentración.((WN)) : Do you think the classification system in shooting is fair?  Do you think it should be changed? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Piensa que el sistema de clasificación en tiro es justo? ¿Piensa que se debería cambiar?Paulo Fontán: I've only been doing this for three years and haven't had time to analyze it deeply so as to have an opinion about it. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Llevo sólo tres años y no he tenido tiempo de analizarlo en profundidad como para tener una opinión al respecto.((WN)) : Would you recommend the sport to other people with disabilities?  What are reasons they should or should not take up the sport? ((es))Spanish language: ‍¿Recomendaría este deporte a otras personas con discapacidad? ¿Cuáles son las razones por las que deberían -o no deberían- practicar este deporte?Paulo Fontán: Yes, I would recommend it, and I would because it is a sport which can be practiced by a wide array of different disabilities, and for a long time. The biggest problem is the high initial investment, the lack of adequate facilities or the cost of travelling to competitions since there are not many places that allow people with disabilities to participate. ((es))Spanish language: ‍Si lo recomendaría, y lo recomiendo porque es un deporte que se pude practicas por una gran diversidad de discapacidades diferentes, y durante mucho tiempo. El mayor problema es la elevada inversión inical, la ausencia de infraestructuras adecuadas o el coste de los desplazamientos a las competiciones (ya que no hay muchas en las que permitan participar a personas con discapacidad).London, England— Yesterday, following a three–nil loss to the United States, Wikinews interviewed Tyan Taylor of Australia's national goalball team.The sport was created in 1946, exclusively for people with a visual disability and, designed to help with the rehabilitation of veterans returning from World War II. Play in the Paralympics consists of two twelve-minute periods, with a three minute break between halves. Players are blindfolded to ensure all are equally visually handicapped on-court; and, the game can be stopped to ensure goggles are properly fitted.  Standing in front of a long goal, they throw the ball at the opposition team's net who in turn try to block it by listening to the ball, which contains a bell, and using their bodies to prevent the ball from going in.  The audience is asked to remain silent during play.Australia went into their match against the US having lost 1–3 to both Japan and Canada. They have one game left to play at the London Paralympics against Sweden, who have lost 1–5 to the United States, tied Japan 0–0 and beaten Canada 2–1.Kirk Shepherd is a professional darts player from the United Kingdom. Kirk began playing competitively at 13 for his local pub, and was soon crowned Boys Champion at the Winmau World Masters in 2003. Shepherd was voted Young Player of the Year by the British Darts Organisation in 2005 and 2006.Shepherd is perhaps best known for his performance at the 2008 PDC World Darts Championship. Forced to qualify for the televised tournament, he then proceeded to knock out a number of well-known players live on television, including Terry Jenkins, Wayne Mardle and former finalist Peter Manley. He ultimately went on to come second in the tournament, becoming the youngest ever finalist, and losing out to John Part in the final.He has also previously managed to defeat the then world number one, Gary Anderson. Due to his performance at the world championship he will play in this year's Grand Slam of Darts next month. Ahead of that appearance Wikinews was able to conduct an interview with Kirk, which is now available below:Recently, Wikinews spent time with with United States Paralympic skier Jasmin Bambur who was at Copper Mountain, Colorado for the IPC Nor-Am Cup.((Wikinews))  We're interviewing Jasmin Bambur. He is a guy. He's from Serbia, right?Jasmin Bambur: Yes, ma'am, I am from Serbia but I race for US Paralympic.((WN))  How did a Serb end up racing for the USA?Jasmin Bambur: It's very simple. You just get married to a fine American lady and she give you citizenship and you ski fast and you get on the team. That's very simple.((WN))  Why do the Australians love you so?Jasmin Bambur: We're a very small community, as ski racers, and we're always great friends. So we kind of hang out together and help each other out. And then in the end, depends who wins, either hate them or love them.((WN))  They said you're some sort of professional racquetball player or something?Jasmin Bambur: It's actually team handball. It's a sport [where] you have seven players like rugby. And yes, I played it professionally until I was 18 in Europe. And when war started in Kosovo, I moved to the United States and that's how I end up here.((WN))  You weren't always a sit skier?Jasmin Bambur: I am a sit skier now but actually the reason I am a sit skier is I had a car accident in 2000. I fell asleep driving. Driving and sleeping don't go together. I don't know why.((WN))  Yeah, that's a difficult lesson to learn. So how have you been doing at this event?Jasmin Bambur: Skiing? I've been skiing for about ten years, racing about four. And so far it's going great.((WN))  You won a medal, at this thing, right? One of these days?  Jasmin Bambur: I won two medals in Super G, two third places, and yesterday I got second place in slalom.((WN))  And what's your favourite one?Jasmin Bambur: Favourite is Super G.((WN))  Because you go fast?Jasmin Bambur: Yes, fast and very little turning. So that's my pick[?].((WN))  Thank you very, very much.Jasmin Bambur: No problem.Wikinews interviewed David Palmer, a member of the USA 2013 World Wheelchair Curling Championship team, about the 2014 Winter Paralympics being held in Sochi, Russia.((Wikinews))  The US qualified a team for the Sochi Games. How likely are you to be on the final team?  As these games would be your first, how excited are you about the possibility of representing your country?David Palmer: It is very likely that I and the team that went to Sochi in 2013 will be the team in the Paralympics 2014 as long as no sickness or injury and we all continue to perform at our level.DP: I am very happy and honored to represent my country.  After competing in the last two world championships which were very exciting, I can not wait for the chance to compete at the Paralympics.((WN))  Were you happy with your team's fourth place finish at this year's World Championships?DP: I was happy with the way the team played, we all thought we should have medaled. We finished third in the round-robin with a record of 7–2 and the closest behind us was 4–5. We all made a few mistakes and did not finish as well as we would have liked, but we are looking forward to next year.((WN))  What steps is the team taking to try to get a gold medal in Sochi?DP: We will be training harder and hopefully playing more bonspiels (tournaments). Because this is a Paralympic year we hope to get more funding, to travel for more high level bonspiels. Because the team is scattered across the country it is hard to get together for practice and bonspiels so we have to do the majority of it on our own. We will be reviewing the tapes from the worlds [World Wheelchair Curling Championship] and video conferencing with team and discussing strategy and performance.((WN))  Why do you participate in wheelchair curling?  Why not wheelchair fencing, tennis, basketball or athletics?DP: I do participate in other sports at a recreational level. I have done waterskiing, monosking, wheelchair tennis and basketball, handcycling. I played and competed in sled hockey for about 12 years, but I found as I got older and the competition got younger it was pretty physical on the body. I went and tried curling at Cape Cod Curling Club in 2009, I found that I not only liked it but I was also pretty good at it. A member there (Tony Colacchio) took me under his wing and showed me the possibilities there were to compete at the National level. I thought he was crazy at first, but four years later here I am curling on team USA and traveling the world.((WN))  What is the nature of your disability? Do you use a wheelchair for most daily activities?DP: I am a T4 Paraplegic, due to a motorcycle accident in 1993. Yes I am dependent on my wheelchair for mobility.((WN))  How does being a parent impact your ability to compete at elite levels?DP: I am married and have three children. Having a family does make it a harder to compete at elite levels,  not only being away traveling, when I am home I am on the ice training a lot. But thanks to the support from my family I have been able to do so. Hopefully it has a positive impact on my children, showing them you can achieve anything you put your mind to.((WN))  Does participating in wheelchair curling cost a lot money?DP: Well that depends! At a recreational level, if you have a wheelchair already all you need is a delivery stick which is about $60.00  and to join a club which has dues usually 300.00 to 500.00 per year. To compete at the highest level, there is travel and lodging involved which can get quite expensive.((WN))  How do you afford to compete at the highest level? Do you have any sponsorship deals?DP: Getting started was tough, I got help through the members of cape cod curling club and a grant from Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF) and some out of my pocket. But once I made the National team there is funding  to help with expenses. I have no sponsorship deals at the moment, but I am open to negotiation!((WN))  Do you think USA Paralympic competitors get enough financial support to enable the country to compete at the highest level?  Is funding equitable in the United States across sports and competitor visibility?DP: No, there is funding, but not nearly enough for an athlete to compete at the highest level.DP: Not from what I hear. I believe the higher viewed sports get a lot more funding. I have been told curling is at bottom for funding.((WN))  What are your thoughts on the classification system and processes for your sport? Do you know of anyone who has been impacted as a result of it?DP: I am not really clear on how the classification system works. I feel that they should make it as equal as possible for everyone who competes in wheelchair curling. Everyone one has different disabilities and different situations, but as long as they are delivering the stone from a stationary wheelchair with a delivery stick from the same position it should be equal.DP: I know of a young man from  state of Washington who uses a wheelchair most of the time but is able to walk and has mobility, that he probably would not qualify for the national team.. Yet I know of a man in Canada that uses a wheelchair only for curling and competes on the National team.((WN))  Have you gotten much media coverage? What do you think of media coverage for curling in general and wheelchair curling specifically?DP: I Have had some media coverage from my locals newspaper, when I was competing in the worlds and when I made the National team.DP: I do not think there is enough coverage  for curling on television although there was quite a bit of coverage at the last Olympics, but not the Paralympics. I think if there were more coverage people would understand the sport better and perhaps grow to love it like I have. There is a lot more to it with strategy and skill than people think.((WN))  What has been your favorite moment as a wheelchair curling competitor?DP: I think this past worlds in Sochi was my favorite time. Curling at the Olympic Venue (which was state of the art Facility), being the first one ever to curl there was special. Being there when they played our national anthem and I was representing my country was priceless!   All of the volunteers there were young college students, they were so friendly and helpful and were asking us for our autographs. I felt like a celebrity. I cannot imagine what the Paralympics are going to feel like!  I just hope I am there!London, England— Last Friday, Wikinews interviewed Trischa Zorn, 55-time medal-winner. The U.S. Paralympic swimmer's haul includes 41 golds.Zorn discussed a variety of issues, including frustration with the classification system that has disadvantaged some United States swimmers because of what she sees as its subjective nature.  She also talked about the increased visibility of the Games, how things have changed from when she started in 1980 to the current 2012 Summer Paralympics.  Zorn discussed how sponsorship has evolved from her early time participating, and issues with the Paralympics inside the United States at the present.This year Zorn was inducted into the International Paralympic Hall of Fame at a ceremony in London.  Having last competed in the 2004 Summer Paralympics, if she was swimming today, she would be classified as an S12 swimmer. She currently works for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, helping returning soldiers adjust to life as civilians.The International Cup is Australian rules footballs world cup. The 2008 event is being held in Melbourne to celebrate  150 years of Australian rules football.Currently the nation winning the International Cup is considered a distant second to Australia, who does not compete at the cup. This is because the difference in skill level between Australia and the next best country is quite considerate. The Australian Football League still names an All-Australian team anyway.London, England — Thursday, Wikinews spoke with Claire Harvey, the captain of Great Britain's Sitting Volleyball Team after her team's loss to Japan. ((LauraHale))  You guys played a great game. The level of the play was just fantastic and all around you. Claire Harvey: Thank you.((LauraHale))  So you're Claire Harvey...Claire Harvey: Yes.((LauraHale))  ... and you're the captain.Claire Harvey: Yes. Yeah. That's right.((LauraHale))  Are you guys planning to qualify for Rio?Claire Harvey: Absolutely! This was always about... we were always going to be the underdogs. We're the only team that weren't in Beijing. Most of us didn't start playing volleyball until 2009, so this was always going to be a very, very tough competition for us. We used the home slot. We earned it absolutely but we very much used it knowing that this was going to be a very tough competition but it's about gaining experience in this sort of arena that you don't get in any other arena, to take us forward into Rio.((LauraHale))  Were you really happy with the level of government support?Claire Harvey: Yes, absolutely! Volleyball England, the VPI, Paralympics GB, have been amazing in supporting us and getting us as a group of people who'd never played volleyball before to where we are now in two and a half years.((LauraHale))  Good news I guess is that you came out of the closet. Do you think you'll be an inspiration for other people with disabilities from that community to take up the sport? Claire Harvey: I hope. I mean, I guess. To me it's not been big news. I've never been in the closet. I need everything that I am to take me on that court as best I can and that's part of me, so it's quite a shock to me when it became big news because to me its just a part of everyday life. I'd like to think I'm an athlete first, and if being gay is part of that, and gives young people some inspiration then all well and good.((LauraHale))  Thank you very much.Claire Harvey: You're welcome.London, England — Yesterday Wikinews had the opportunity to tour the Ottobrock wheelchair repair workshops at the Paralympic Village in London.It is one of a network of workshops at every Paralympic venue. They are run by Ottobrock, which has been repairing wheelchairs at the Paralympics since 1988. The workshop opened on August 22 and will remain until September 10.The Ottobrock employees include people from 20 countries. Between them, they speak 23 languages. They liken themselves to the pit crew of motor sport — except that they have no idea what sort of equipment they will have to work with. The store room contains 15,000 spare parts, with everything from spare carbon fibre running blades to spare tyres — over 2,000 of them. They stock Ottobrock parts and their competitors' too, as they have no idea what will arrive at the workshop next. Athletes from around the world bring in all manner of equipment.The prosthetic technicians have to deal with everything from flat tyres to broken spokes to full-scale rebuilds. They have to be expert problem solvers. They frequently collaborate on determining how best to effect a repair. The objective is to get the wheelchair repaired and back in service as soon as possible.Wheelchairs vary somewhat in design, depending on the sport. Those for wheelchair basketball and rugby have cambered wheels so they can spin around. Aluminum and titanium parts are used for strength. Ottobrock has a welding workshop where frames are repaired; the teams' equipment managers understandably cannot bring such heavy equipment with them to the games, so they rely on the workshops. When a repair job is required, it is often required in a hurry. At the Turkey vs United States game, a chair was repaired during the match.In addition to wheelchairs, the workshops handle all manner of work with prostheses. Carbon fibre running blades are adjusted. Broken feet and legs are a challenge. The Chinese Boccia team brought in its power chairs to have the electronics adjusted. In that sport, having the controls working perfectly is all-important.There are 4,200 athletes at the Paralympic games. So far, the workshops have carried out 1,100 repairs.On Tuesday, English capital football club Chelsea F.C. announced 27-year-old Brazilian midfielder Willian has signed a four-year contract extension with the club.Willian joined The Blues three years ago  in summer 2013 from Russian club FC Anzhi Makhachkala.

This move was possibly illegal under Animal Welfare Act 2006, which prevents using lethal force unless it is used as a last resort.File:BruceFriedrich1.jpgWikinews spoke to Bruce Friedrich, Vice President of PETA, which has campaigned against the move. He said that "killing animals so quickly and for such frivolous reasons is cruel, illegal, and won’t work."Wikinews has also been told by Friedrich that "the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club should still be prosecuted for cruelty to animals, since they broke the law and should be held accountable."Violation of the Animal Welfare act carries a maximum sentence of "imprisonment for a term not exceeding 51 weeks" or a fine "not exceeding £20,000"Wikinews has also been given a copy of the letter sent to Wimbledon officials. Below is the text of the first paragraph:The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (which runs the Wimbledon Championships) has not yet released a statement regarding the incident, although The Independent has reported that one will be made after the tournament.With main topic of "Sports Elites Shining in Port City - Kaohsiung", winners of 2007 Taiwan Sports Elite Awards, organized by Republic of China Sports Federation (ROCSF) and supervised by Sports Affairs Council, Executive Yuan of R.O.C., Taiwan (abbr. as SAC Taiwan), were announced and awarded at September 9 (Sports Day) in Kaohsiung Municipal Social Education Center.Organizers and arena host "Kaohsiung Municipal Social Education Center" held a warming up event before main award ceremony starts in the evening, such as "One Million Star" entertainer Zap An and Stanley Hsu, and Taiwanese music band "Cherry Boom" showed at warming up event.After the warming up event, organizers invited all of nominees and VIPs coming in the Auditorium for the Award Ceremony.

Paul Reddam announced that the thoroughbred was injured and he will not only be removed from the race Saturday but he will be retired from any further racing. The reason I'll Have Another was scratched from the field was because of a swelling in his left front tendon, according to trainer Doug O'Neill.I'll Have Another was not the favorite in either the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness Stakes, but he was twice able to pass the leader Bodemeister, who was the pace setting horse in both those races, to take the victories. The last race was won in the final lengths. Bodemeister will also not race in the Belmont Stakes Saturday. Before the Kentucky Derby, I'll Have Another won the Santa Anita Derby. All of these races were won with Mexican jockey Mario Gutierrez.Dale Romans, who is Dullahan's trainer, reacted to the news, "It's devastating. I thought this was going to be one of the greatest races in history, and I wanted the opportunity to be part of it." Dullahan raced in this year's Kentucky Derby and took third place.Only eleven horses have ever won the Triple Crown in the United States. In order to win the Triple Crown, a horse has to race and win the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. The first Triple Crown winner was Sir Barton in 1919 and the last was Affirmed in 1978. The dry spell will continue at least another year — the 34th year without a Triple Crown victory.The 2014 Winter Paralympics officially opened last night in Sochi, Russia.  The ceremony was attended by Russian Federation leader Vladmir Putin.  45 nations are competing, including Argentina, Kazakhstan, the United States, Mexico, Armenia, Brazil, Ukraine, and Russia.  During the speech about values to be upheld during the Games, sexual orientation was mentioned.  There were no direct mentions of the situation in the Crimea region of Ukraine, whose 31-athlete-strong delegation participated in the parade of nations with only their flag bearer.  During a press conference earlier yesterday, the Ukrainian Paralympic Committee President said the team had two or three options they were considering for the Opening Ceremony.Story IntroGame RecapUkrainian heavyweight boxer Wladimir Klitschko began his quest to unify the heavyweight boxing titles Saturday night.  The IBF Heavyweight Champion defeated Russian WBO Heavyweight Champion, Sultan Ibragimov, by unanimous decision in the main event of a boxing card at Madison Square Garden in New York City.Many of the spectators were disappointed by the conservative boxing mechanics used by both Klitschko and the Russian Ibragimov.  But the decision was clearly in the Ukrainian's favor, as the scorecards read 119-110, 118-110 and 117-111 in his favor.It was Ibragimov's first defeat, bringing his record to 22-1-1 with 17 KO's.  Klitschko is now 50-3 with 44 KO's.While Klitschko looks forward to vying for the WBA and WBC titles, held by Uzbekistani Ruslan Chagaev and Russian Oleg Maskaev, respectively, his next fight will be against Aleksandr Povetkin in an IBF-mandated title defense.  Chagaev's next fight is against Luan Krasinqi.  Maskaev next fights Samuel Peter, with the winner facing Wladimir's brother, Vitali Klitschko.Tonight (Friday night) in Australia, the Women's National Basketball League's Sydney Uni Flames decisively beat the Canberra Capitals by a score of 96–50 at a game played in Sydney.The Capitals shot poorly, with a team average of 30% from field goal range, ultimately going 21/70.  In contrast, Sydney shot 54%, 36/67 from field goal range. Canberra was worse from three point range, going 3/11 compared to the Flames who shot 8/15.The Flames had several players in double digits, including April Sykes with 29, Alicia Poto with 15, and Rohanee Cox with 14.  Only Brigitte Ardossi was in double digits for the Capitals with 21 points.  Canberra's next leading scorers were Michelle Cosier with 9 and Nicole Hunt with 6.Sydney also dominated in other key statistics, including total rebounds with 36 to the Capitals' 28, steals with 12 to Canberra's 2, and blocks with 7 to the Capitals' 5.  The Capitals turned the ball over more than Sydney, with 22 to the Flames' 11.The win was only the third of the season for Sydney, who are now on a two game winning streak.  Canberra's loss continues their loosing streak, now sitting at four in a row.  They sit sixth on the ladder, two games behind the Bulleen Boomers in the playoff chase.Canberra had off court problems in the game against Sydney with Michelle Cosier and Alexandra Bunton both dealing with illness. The Capitals will not be able to count on Lauren Jackson coming back any time soon, as she is out until at least after Christmas with a hamstring injury. Canberra's poor performance comes at a time when the team's head coach, Carrie Graf, is under scrutiny.  The previous Australian women's national basketball team coach, Jan Stirling, has suggested perhaps Graf should take leave from the team during Olympic and World Championship years, as part of analysis following the national team's performance at the London Olympics. Graf's coaching contracts with the national team and the Capitals both finish at the end of the year, and she is currently negotiating for a new deal with Basketball Australia that may create a situation where she is ineligible to coach for the Capitals because the national team position may become a full time one.Wolfsburg player Ashkan Dejagah drew criticism today for planning to not participate in Germany's 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification match against Israel, which is scheduled to be played on October 12 in Tel Aviv.The issue stems from the fact that Dejagah is an Iranian-born citizen. Dejagah was quoted as saying, "I have more Iranian than German blood in my veins" and "That should be respected, and besides I'm doing this out of respect. My parents are Iranian." Iran-Israel relations are currently tense and Iranian citizens are forbidden from traveling to Israel since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, while at the same time, Iran began to refuse to recognize Israel's right to exist. Several German politicians and media members have called for Dejagah to be expelled from the German national team.This is not the first time that the Iran-Israel conflict has entered German football. Current Hanover and Iran national team striker Vahid Hashemian, when he was with Bayern Munich, was pulled from the squad scheduled to face Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv in a Champions League game in 2004. Although Bayern cited a back injury as the reason for the Iranian's withdrawal, the potential visit proved controversial, with opposition to Hashemian's involvement coming from Iran's national sporting body.English football club Wolverhampton Wanderers have been relegated from the Premier League after a 2-0 defeat to Manchester City. Goals from Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri confirmed the fate of Wolves, ending their three year spell in the top division of English football. Wolves are currently at the bottom of the table with 23 points.Manager Terry Connor said to Sky Sports "It’s tough - a raw day. We knew coming in we had to try and win it - it is raw for the players, staff, supporters and everyone connected to Wolves. It probably will be for a few days". He also commented about fans in attendance at the Molineux saying "They were superb today and for the majority of the season they’ve been great. Today is a raw, emotional day. I understand they’ll be hurting over the next weeks to come."The result also left Manchester City three points behind top of the table Manchester United. Should they defeat Manchester United on April 30 they will top the table on goal difference only. At the other end of the table sit Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers with 30 and 31 points respectively. Just outside of the relegation zone is Wigan Athletic and Queens Park Rangers both on 34 points.Two Australian Rules Football (AFL) players for the Western Bulldogs team rescued a woman who was drowning in the waters of Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. Midfielder Daniel Cross and defender Tom Williams hauled the woman out of the water and into safe hands.The woman was believed to have been attempting suicide, and when Cross and Williams threw a life ring out to her, she refused to grab onto it. Initially, the pair were not aware that the woman was suicidal, and only intervened after hearing calls for help from bystanders.Chief executive of the team Campbell Rose said that "The boys are in good spirit," and that he was extremely proud of the pair.A woman found herself £226,000 richer, one the biggest ever payouts to a female client, after placing a series of bets on last weeks Champions League games, despite knowing nothing about football.Kathrin Rotmann, 33, placed a £1,000 bet based on her tactics of supporting "teams that are strong and winning"."I am delighted. I only ever bet on football — last year I won £35,000 with one bet. I just keep a track of those teams which are playing well and bet on them. It was very exciting when the results went my way."She was delighted when she saw her bet multiply in front of her eyes, when  her 226-1 odds of wins for Arsenal, Man United, Rangers, Slavia Prague, Barcelona, Roma, Fenerbahce and PSV come in on television.The exact amount won was £226,834.36.With three full competitions complete as of this morning at the 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships in La Molina, Spain, Great Britain's women skiers have delivered all three of the nation's medals.In the women's visually impaired downhill, Kelly Gallagher and guide Charlotte Evans earned a bronze medal on the first day of competition.

The 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships is scheduled to continue today with the Super Combined event.The International Olympic Committee has decided to allow women to compete in boxing at the Olympics for the first time.  Up until now boxing had been the only sport in which women could not compete.  Three weight classes will be created for the women to compete in, with one weight class being dropped from the male schedule. President of the IOC Jacques Rogge commented, "Women's boxing has come on a tremendous amount in the last five years and it was time to include them." Gerry Sutcliffe, the British sports minister, said, "The move is a massive boost for women’s boxing." Not all were supportive of the inclusion of the women’s ranks. 2004 Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan said, "Deep down I think women shouldn’t fight. That’s my opinion."  Despite his comments he said he will be supporting the British competitors at the 2012 Olympics being held in London. The inclusion of the women’s classes comes after it was announced in 2005 that both baseball and softball would be excluded form the Olympics after the 2008 games.The three remaining matches of round one are scheduled to be played next Saturday (April 10). Morwell will host Warragul in Morwell, Drouin will play Maffra in Drouin and Moe will host Traralgon at Yallourn North with Sale having the bye.The Gippsland Football League is considered one of the "major leagues" controlled by the Victorian Country Football League, the governing body of Australian rules football in regional Victoria, Australia.At the league's annual general meeting in December, it changed it's name from the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League.

The Power made five concecutive Alberton Grand Finals winning three, losing only to Yarram (2007) and Stony Creek (2009).Wonthaggi Power Football Club is a result of a merger between Wonthaggi Blues, a former Gippsland FL team, and Wonthaggi Rovers, an Alberton FL team. In February, the Gippsland Football League announced that Wonthaggi would be changing their uniforms, because their original one was similar to that of Warragul.Leongatha finished the 2009 season losing the minor semi final against enventual grand final winners Maffra.

Goals are worth six points, behinds one.Wonthggi kicked off their first game in the major league with a opening quarter lead of four and a half goals over rivals Leongatha. The Power's move from the Alberton League looked to be justified as they went in to cruise mode.Leongatha slowly clawed back the deficit over the next three quarters but the first quarter result and inaccurate kicking caused them to fall short by one point.Traralgon defeated Wonthaggi by five goals at the Wonthaggi Recreation Reserve as they kept in touch with Maffra at the top of the Gippsland Football League in Australia's state of Victoria. Wonthaggi now sit a game out of the top five.Maffra (nine wins one loss) are on top a game clear of Traralgon, with Moe a further game back.

The current players of the their team made their way up the road, with current team owners John W. Henry and Tom Werner and president Larry Lucchino, who were followed by General Manager Theo Epstein and Manager Terry Francona, both of whom had their own boat. The rally chugged along, as airplanes carrying banners congratulating the Red Sox flew over, with the duck boats filled with the team and it's supporters and even one for the Red Sox players of yesteryear, Dom DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky. Kyle Snyder held up the trophy for all on Boylston Street to gaze at the reward the Sox fought so hard for. Catcher and team captain, Jason Varitek waved a sign encouraging team management to re-sign third baseman and World Series MVP, Mike Lowell. The crowd greeted this with enthusiasm leading to cheers of "Re-sign Lowell!"However, Jonathan Papelbon was not on a duck boat, he was on a flatbed truck playing air guitar with a broom with local Celtic punk stars, the Dropkick Murphys, who first gained notoriety in 2004, with a reworking of the old Boston Red Sox fan song, Tessie, which became the rallying cry for the 2004 season. The band gained either further recognition when their song I'm Shipping Up to Boston, which based on lyrics written by Woody Guthrie, was featured in the soundtrack of the Academy Award-winning Best Picture The Departed. Papelbon chose the song as his to play when taking the field and became a huge hit with the crowd after performing a Irish step dance to the song after winning the AL East title in the beginning of the month and performing it again after winning both the ALCS and the World Series. Papelbon was joined by fellow pitchers, Hideki Okijima and Mike Timlin.This may not be the last rolling rally Boston will see this year, currently the Foxborough, Massachusetts based American football team New England Patriots are currently undefeated in the NFL and appear at this time to be headed to another Super Bowl and possibly to becoming the second NFL team in the league's history to go undefeated an entire season. The other team that went undefeated was the 1972 Miami Dolphins team. In college football, the Boston College Eagles are also undefeated and are currently ranked number two in the NCAA. Meanwhile, the Boston Celtics who seemed to have lost another chance after drawing 5th in the NBA draft lottery are currently doing very well with their two new stars, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett both acquired in trades.

The stoppage is expected to last 48 hours and could leave millions of travelers without transportation.Sky News says that there are fears that the strike may affect fan transportation for the England national football team's 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier match against Andorra at Wembley Stadium tomorrow.

The stadium gates will now open at 17:45 BST (16:45 GMT).No extra transport is being put on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable at the ground. Fears of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to play behind closed doors without the team's supporters.Watmore said that refunds will be available for supporters that do not attend the game. Last week, the FA decided to halt ticket sales at 70,000 in anticipation of a possible strike.

Chris Jericho will face current antagonist Shawn Michaels in a Ladder Match for the championship at the pay-per-view. Jericho talked about the fact that while fans applauded Michaels' remarks regarding his accomplishments in ladder matches fans have forgotten that Jericho has won three championship titles in ladder matches, and has participated in more high-profile ladder matches than Michaels. This would draw out former champion Randy Orton, who has been injured with a shoulder injury for the last three months. Orton on a tear criticizing current and former champions as well as top contenders as to their worthiness of holding the title, and Chris Jericho was no exception. Just as it looked like Jericho was ready to pummel Orton, Orton declared that WWE Raw General Manager Mike Adamle made a new proclamation that anybody who attacked Orton would be suspended indefinitely. Jericho withdrew from the ring, but was immediately replaced by CM Punk, a man Orton attacked a few weeks ago, costing him the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in a four-way match at the WWE Unforgiven pay-per-view. Punk and Orton would come nose-to-nose before Punk slapped Orton in the face, sending him reeling to the corner. General manager Mike Adamle came out along with acting on-air representative Shane McMahon. Together they diffused the situation between Punk and Orton, and announce the main event match, champion Chris Jericho and John "Bradshaw" Layfield against Shawn Michaels and Dave Batista. Before that main event happened, Jericho would talk with Mike Adamle in his office, speculating that the reason Shane McMahon was at the show was to test Adamle's skills as a leader rather than a company yes-man, and that rather than following Mr. McMahon's directions to the letter, that he should use them as a suggestion for his own ideas. This would result in the main event becoming a three-on-two match, with the addition of Lance Cade to the team of Jericho and Layfield. Cade, a former  protégé for Shawn Michaels and current ally of Jericho, played a major factor in the match. Cade's presence in the ring was a distraction to Shawn Michaels, who spent the majority of the match fighting off double-team efforts and cut off from making a tag to his partner. Dave Batista would eventually make that tag, but would be quickly overpowered by Jericho and Layfield. Michaels would tag in one last time while Batista would continue to fight outside of the ring with Layfield. Michaels appeared to have Cade defeated, but a distraction by Jericho allowed Cade to recover and attack Michaels from behind, pinning him after executing a sit-out powerbomb.

Cryme Tyme by pinfall;WWE World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho, John Bradshaw Layfield & Lance Cade def. Shawn Michaels & Dave BatistaReigning WWE World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho was involved in several controversies on Monday evening. Jericho was told last week that he would face CM Punk, the former champion, in a steel cage match for the title during last week's episode of Raw. What he wasn't told was that this would be the first match on the card for this evening, further frustrating the already banged-up champion. The two men would spend nearly twenty minutes attempting to scramble over each other to be the first to scale their way out of the cage, with former champion Punk appearing to dominate for most of the match. In the end, it would be Jericho who would prevail, after an inadvertent head butt by Jericho sent Punk reeling back towards the middle of the ring, while Jericho haphazardly stumbled backwards through the open cage door. After the match, Jericho would seek out WWE Raw General Manager Mike Adamle, taking issue with being booked to wrestle in four high-profile matches in a three-week time span, and demanded that the rookie G.M. needed to learn how to take care of his champions. The two men left to talk in private. Later in the evening, John "Bradshaw" Layfield lodged a protest in the middle of the ring after his match, demanding that G.M. Adamle declare him to be the #1 Contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. This brought out another former champion, the injured Randy Orton, who told Layfield that he was not impressed with Layfield's performances as of late, and that he was no more worthy to be named the top contender than anybody else who had been making those claims lately. This brought out WWE Intercontinental Champion Santino Marella and girlfriend WWE Women's Champion Beth Phoenix, both of whom have been unhappy with Orton's remarks about them. The four individuals argued, which then brought out yet another former champion, Dave Batista, to continue the arguments. G.M. Adamle then appeared on the arena video screens, informing all of the individuals that he would be consulting with current champion Chris Jericho to determine the top contender, which would be announced later in the evening. This would lead to Dave Batista attempting to influence the decisions by attacking Layfield, Marella and Phoenix in the ring, while Randy Orton quickly left. The evening would end on a surprising note for the champion, however. Chris Jericho returned to the ring, informing the fans and G.M. Adamle that his preference would be that John "Bradshaw" Layfield and Dave Batista would face each other at the WWE "No Mercy" pay-per-view later this month to determine the top contender, and afterwards Jericho would immediately defend the championship against the winner. Adamle came out in front of the live crowd and stated that while he agreed with the idea of the two men fighting for the top contender position at the pay-per-view, he did not like the idea of either of them having to wrestle a second match that night. Instead, the men would face the WWE World Heavyweight Champion at another point in time. Jericho took exception to this, he wanted to defend the title at the show. Adamle informed Jericho that he would be defending the title against an opponent who asked for a shot at the title earlier in the evening. The fans speculated that this was the returning Shawn Michaels, and they were proven correct when Michaels made his presence in front of the fans. Michaels, who recently defeated Jericho in a vicious "unsanctioned" fight just a few weeks ago at the WWE "Unforgiven" pay-per-view, declared that he wanted one more shot at Jericho to satisfy his personal vendetta as well as chance to claim the championship for himself. Michaels stated that the stipulation would be for a Ladder Match. Full match results for the evening:WWE World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho d.

Kane by disqualificationUp-and-coming WWE star Vladimir Kozlov came to Nashville, TN on Tuesday night with an agenda. "I want better competition," the former sambo champion from Ukrane said last week. "If you will not give it to me, then I will find it myself." Kozolv has done just that, and he started his quest by attacking the top contender for the WWE Championship, Jeff Hardy, at the end his match last week. Hardy would again be the target for Kozlov's frustrations, but he would not be alone. Hardy had just won a hard-fought match against Brian Kendrick, as he was walking up the stage, he turned around to wave to the fans. As Hardy turned around to go backstage, he was surprised by Kozlov with a stiff kick to the chest. The blow left Hardy on the stage, gasping for breath, he would be carried away by medical staff during a commercial break. Later in the evening, it would be WWE Champion Triple H who would become the new target. After Triple H defeated Montel Vontavious Porter in the main event match, Vladimir Kozlov would ambush the champion as he was celebrating in the ring. Triple H, no stranger to being attacked unprepared, quickly retaliated and appeared to have the rookie handled. Kozlov was able to hold his own, and brought down the champion with a vicious head butt. As Triple H laid on the mat knocked out, Kozlov mouthed the words, "The end is near for you." Vladimir Kozlov received word shortly before this second attack that his wish for tougher competition would be answered. If he wants a shot at the WWE Champion, he will have to first go through another former champion, the 7'3" Great Khali. In other events, the reigning WWE Tag Team Champions were also looking for competition. Curt Hawkins and Zach Ryder made an impromptu appearance during Carlito's Cabana as host Carlito Colon was introducing the fans to his younger brother, WWE newcomer Primo Colon. The brothers from Puerto Rico had won their first match as a tag team last week. Hawkins and Ryder came down to the ring and picked a fight with the Colon brothers, challenging them to a match next week. It appeared that the tag team champions were leaving the ring, but when the Colon brothers turned their backs to leave as well, they were attacked by Hawkins and Ryder. Jesse and Festus Dalton came down to the ring to break the scuffle up. Full match results for the evening: WWE Diva's Champion Michelle McCool d.

He suffered a herniated disc in his neck, in a lost match against a wrestler named Batista.Just hours after surgery, he visited the locker room of the SmackDown/ECW taping, commenting to the WWE website that: "I feel great. Dr. Maroon is fantastic. He explained every possible procedure he could and could not perform, and the potential risks of all of them. I explained to Dr. Maroon not only my immediate goals, but also my long-term goals. He took them all into consideration and recommended the most commonplace procedure with the least amount of side effects."While the option of fusion surgery was chosen previously by other WWE wrestlers (Edge, Steve Austin, Chris Benoit), Maroon removed a fragment from Cena's spinal cord, which had been blocking a nerve.The operation lasted 90 minutes; recovery is expected to take three months, instead of a previously suggested 12-14 months.In his WWE career, Cena is a three-time WWE Champion, a three-time United States Champion, and a two-time World Tag Team Champion. He also won the 2008 Royal Rumble. Before being promoted to the main WWE roster, Cena trained in and wrestled for Ultimate Pro Wrestling and Ohio Valley Wrestling, holding the top titles of both promotions.The following is how the medal table looks after the final day of competition for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, in Melbourne, Australia.In the final event of the Games, New Zealand defeated the reigning Netball Commonwealth champion Australia, 60-55, for the first time in 12 years.Australia received its largest medal haul in Commonwealth Games history, receiving more than a third of the gold medals available; a total of 221 medals.

At the age of 22 years and 6 months she is the youngest professional golfer of either gender to earn five major titles. Her final round of 69 allowed her to overcome a two shot deficit to third round leader Caroline Masson of Germany and finish with a four shot cushion over runner-up Brittany Lang of USA.The Ricoh Women's British Open is one of four designated major championships on the LPGA Tour and the final such tournament on the 2011 schedule.The New York Yankees rebounded from a tough loss on Saturday to win Sunday's game 9-4 against the Cleveland Indians thanks to some timely hitting.Randy Johnson (9-6) allowed three runs on nine hits, six of which were leadoff hits. His performance bested Tribe starter Jake Westbrook (6-11), who pitched well to start the game but then surrendered two runs in the 4th inning and three in the 5th as the Yankees' hitters constructed a lead.Recently acquired reliever Wayne Franklin threatened to lose the lead in the 7th inning, but was saved by Tanyon Sturtze, who came on to get the final out of the inning. Gary Sheffield then responded in the bottom of the inning with a three-run homer hit deep into the right-center field bleachers, stretching the Yankee lead to 9-4.Mariano Rivera closed out the game with a two-inning appearance, recording his 20th save. He enters the All-Star break preparing for Tuesday's game, along with Sheffield and Alex Rodriguez. The Yankees currently trail the AL East leader Boston Red Sox by 2.5 games, but face tough road series against the BoSox, Rangers, and Angels when play resumes on Thursday.The race in the AL East is alive and well.The New York Yankees mounted a comeback from an early 4-0 deficit to beat the Boston Red Sox, 8-6, last night, and reduce the Sox' AL East division lead to a mere 1.5 games. The key was the Yankees' hot bats. The Bronx Bombers hit 4 homeruns in total, the last one a thunderous 2-run blast by Alex Rodriguez off converted Red Sox starter Curt Schilling, who was in his first appearance as a relief pitcher after his rehab stint in the minors.Boston jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead against Yankees starter Mike Mussina, establishing the sort of lead that would usually cause the Yankees to fold during the first half of the season. However, the torrid hitting of the Yankee lineup over the last two weeks would not allow that. Mussina adjusted to the tight strike zone as the game progressed, allowing just one run over the next five innings, and the Yankees chipped away at the BoSox' lead. Bernie Williams, Jason Giambi, and Gary Sheffield all hit solo shots off Red Sox starter Bronson Arroyo. At the end of the sixth inning the score was tied, 5-5, and both starters were done for the day. The game would come down to relief pitching.David Ortiz put the Red Sox ahead in the bottom of the seventh, hitting a bases-empty home run off Tanyon Sturtze to push the score to 6-5. The Yankees rebounded in the top half of the eighth when Ruben Sierra, pinch-hitting for rookie CF Melky Cabrera, connected for a double, tying the game at 6-all.Schilling came on in the top of the ninth and promptly hung a 2-2 splitter over the plate for Gary Sheffield, who lined a double off the wall in left-center. Rodriguez was up next, and hit another splitter that never split. The two-run homer gave the Yankees their first lead of the game. Mariano Rivera came on in the bottom of the ninth and silenced the Red Sox bats by striking out the side to end the game, recording his 21st save.Boston has lost three straight games and is now 10 games over .500 at 49-39. The Yankees (47-40) have won 8 of 9 games dating back to before the All-Star break and currently sit in 3rd place, half a game behind 2nd-place Baltimore.Notes: Rookie Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang, who has been one of the Yankees' most consistent performers, has been placed on the 15-day DL with a shoulder injury. It has been speculated that Wang, who tore his labrum while in the minors, may be out for the season. Wang was slated to start tonight's game, but will be replaced by Tim Redding as he waits for an appointment with Dr. James Andrews on Monday...Former Red Sox manager Joe Kerrigan has been signed by the Yankees as an advance scout. General manager Brian Cashman has said that Kerrigan will be used to analyze film of opponents, not as a coach.The win Sunday by the Yankees at Fenway Park gives them 3 in a row in the 4 game series, and inches them closer to the top in baseball's American League East. Behind the pitching of newly-acquired Al Leiter, the 5-3 win over the Red Sox puts them a 1/2 game out of the top spot. A sweep by taking final game of the series will make them the leader in the tight American League East race.The injury-laden Yankee pitching staff got a lift from Leiter's performance who went 6 1/3 innings, and allowed one run on three hits. The 39-year-old lefty came by way of trade with the Marlins to return to the pitching staff. Yankee manager Joe Torre said, "The one thing we knew about the start was that he wasn't going to come in here and be rattled or be nervous." In Saturday's game, Randy Johnson struck out 10 and Alex Rodriguez homered in a 6-run 3rd as the Yankees beat the Red Sox at Fenway Park , 7 - 4. Matt Clement was roughed up early, allowing six runs, five hits, and five walks over 2 and two-thirds innings. Johnny Damon extended his league-leading hitting streak to 28. The Red Sox had a chance to creep closer to the Yankees but a would-be 2 run shot off David Ortiz was caught.American League East standings:Boston  -New York  0.5Baltimore   1.0Toronto   5.5Tampa Bay  20.0In the third and longest stage of the Tour de France today, the Swiss leader Fabian Cancellara didn't wait to compete with the sprinters, and used his time trial qualities to just hold them off and haul in a second victory.The riders had 236.5 km in front of them when they started around 11 a.m. this morning in Waregem, Belgium, heading for the French town Compiègne, which is known also as the start of the race Paris-Roubaix. Remarkably, the riders didn't go faster than 30 km/hour most of the stage, so they came in an hour behind schedule after almost seven hours in the saddle.After an early escape, Nicolas Vogondy and Matthieu Ladagnous were joined by Stephane Auge and Frederik Willems (the first three French, the latter Belgian) at 42 km of the finish. The former duo had a maximum lead of around 13 minutes 45 seconds, but the quartet of escapees was caught by the peleton just 500 m from the finish.The yellow jersey and winner of the prologue took an early shot at the finale and managed to keep off Erik Zabel, Danilo Napolitano and Tom Boonen, among others. The bonus seconds expand Canchellara's lead from 13 to 33 seconds. In the climbing ranking, David Millar lost the polka dot jersey to Stephane Auge but remains third, 43 seconds behind Cancellara.Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after being involved in a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.  While on his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his bike, and was then struck by fellow racer Xavier Zayat.  He was immediately attended to by the on-track medical staff and transported to a local hospital where he later died.  Zayat was unhurt in the accident.Lenz was due to participate at the US Grand Prix Racers Union event ahead of the world championship races.

"The world lost one of its brightest lights today. God Bless Peter and the other rider involved. 45 is on another road we can only hope to reach. Miss you kiddo."It is expected that Lenz's death will re-spark the debate over age restrictions when it comes to professional racing. The Speedway officials declined to comment on the subject. Lenz is the first person to die at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since Tony Renna was killed in an IndyCar test in 2003.Zach Johnson won the 2007 Masters Golf Tournament in Augusta, Georgia Sunday. His score of +1 over par (289) is the second highest score ever recorded for the Masters. He was two strokes ahead of three runners up, Tiger Woods, Retief Goosen, and Rory Sabbatini.This is Johnson's first win in a Major Championship, and second PGA win. He finished in 17th place in the 2005 PGA Championship, but was cut from the British Open three years in a row. Johnson netted $1,305,000 USD for this win.Tiger Woods, four-time Masters winner and score record holder for the tournament, said "This one's not disappointing, I threw this tournament away on two days when I had two good rounds and I [finished] bogey, bogey. So four bogeys in the last two holes basically cost me the tournament." Woods failed to finish any of the four rounds below par.Gianluca Zambrotta returns to Serie A after agreeing to a contract with AC Milan.

Zidane had headbutted Italian player Marco Materazzi and was sent off after 110 minutes play.But on French television Zidane showed remorse for his behaviour. "I want to ask for forgiveness from all the children who watched," he said.It was expected that Zidane would reveal what provoked him into the headbutt. However, Zidane refused to divulge what Materazzi actually said but did say that Materazzi made remarks which were "very personal" and specifically concerned his mother and sister. Materazzi had earlier admitted that he insulted Zidane, but denied any remarks on Zidane's mother or having made a racial slur. "I didn't insult his mother. I lost my mother when I was 15 years old and still get emotional when I talk about it." "Zidane is my hero and I have always admired him a lot," said Materazzi.While the French star's comments contradicted Materazzi's view Zidane also refused to apologise to Materazzi for his on-field assault. "I want to apologise to them [the children] but I can't regret what I did because it would mean that he [Materazzi] was right to say what he said".The partial apology comes as FIFA President Sept Blatter said Zidane may be stripped of his Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player. FIFA set up a disciplinary committee to investigate Zidane's violent conduct.After the red card to Zidane, Italy went on to win the final on penalty kicks.Former Zimbabwean professional footballer Adam Ndlovu has died in a car accident that also left his brother critically injured.

Klose's strike partner Lukas Podolski, had won the best young player award of the tournament.Italy's goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon won the best goalkeeper award, while Portugal were named the most entertaining team in the tournament.On Tuesday, Sweden's football captain Zlatan Ibrahimović announced he will not play international football again after UEFA Euro 2016. He said he will not participate in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil in August.Speaking to the media before yesterday's final Group E match against Belgium, 34-year-old forward Ibrahimović said, "The last game at the Euros will be my last game for Sweden, so I hope it won't be tomorrow" ((sv))Swedish language: ‍Sista matchen för Sverige i EM blir min sista match för Sverige. Jag hoppas inte att det blir i morgon. He added "I won't participate in the Olympics, because my last game will be the last game Sweden does in this EURO. So let's hope it goes as long as possible.

With this victory, Nadal became the first person to win a particular Grand Slam on ten occasions in the open era.32-year-old Wawrinka, who has featured in three Grand Slam finals before yesterday's match, had a 100% win record, while Nadal, who won his first French Open title in 2005 at the age of 19, had never lost a French Open final.In the match lasting​ for just two hours and five minutes, Nadal served four aces, while the 2014 French Open winner Wawrinka hit only one. Nadal won six break points out of thirteen. His opponent, Wawrinka, missed his only chance to break the Spaniard's serve. Wawrinka, who faced first seeded Andy Murray in the semi-final — winning that match 6–7 6–3 5–7 7–6 6–1 after four hours and 34 minutes — committed 29 unforced errors, compared to Rafa's twelve.Just as in 2008 and 2010, Nadal did not drop a single set in the entire tournament. Last year, Nadal had to withdraw from the tournament due to wrist injury. Nadal extended his record at the French Open to 79–2, losing just two matches in thirteen seasons on the French soil. Nadal is the third man to win this Grand Slam title in his teens, 20s, and 30s; the others were Ken Rosewall and Pete Sampras.After the match, Nadal said, "You know, on paper, when you look at the scores, it all seems fairly easy[...] But it's not. As I said before, the French Open is the most important tournament of the year. That means when you arrive in Paris, I'm very nervous and I know that it's going to be difficult for me. Year after year it's becoming increasingly difficult, because I'm getting older, also." Nadal now has fifteen Grand Slam singles titles. Only Roger Federer has more than him. Nadal has faced Federer in the French Open finals four times. A player who defeated Nadal at Roland Garros has never won the tournament in that year, which remains true to current date.On Saturday, Spanish football club Real Madrid defeated their city rivals Atlético Madrid 5–3 in a penalty shootout decider in the UEFA Champions League final played at the San Siro stadium in Milan, as the match ended in a 1–1 draw after 120 minutes.
