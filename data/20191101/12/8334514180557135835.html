      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s ruling Conservatives warned on Friday that voting for the rival Brexit Party could prevent Britain from leaving the EU and could put left-wing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn into power at an upcoming election.</p>
      <p>“A vote for (Brexit Party Leader Nigel) Farage risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street via the back door,” Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>“It will not get Brexit done - and it will create another gridlocked parliament that doesn’t work.”</p>
