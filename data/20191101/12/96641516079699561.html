      <h1>The Engadget Podcast: Do you need Apple's AirPods Pro?</h1>
      <h2>Wireless earbuds are here to stay -- and they're finally worth buying.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:30:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/engadget-podcast-airpods-pro-wireless-earbuds/devindra" target="_blank">Devindra Hardawar</a></address>
      <p>This week it's all about computers in our ears, or hearables, if you prefer. Apple announced the long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/29/apple-airpods-pro-hands-on-noise-canceling-preview/">AirPods Pro</a> on Tuesday, but even though they helped popularize wireless earbuds, now just about every tech company has their own pair as well. We chat about what's new with the AirPods Pro, as well as how to find the perfect pair of earbuds for you. Plus, we talk about the state of smartwatches. (Note: This episode was recorded before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/google-buys-fitbit/?utm_campaign=homepage&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_source=dl">Google's Fitbit acquisition</a> was confirmed.)</p>
