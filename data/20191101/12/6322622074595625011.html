      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang Bhd (C&amp;C) has sunk into its fourth straight quarter of losses, posting a net loss of RM12.24 million in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19), against a net profit of RM3.51 million in the previous corresponding quarter, due to lower sales and weaker margins.</p>
      <p>This has resulted in its recorded loss per share of 12.15 sen for 3QFY19 versus earnings per share of 3.48 sen for 3QFY18, according to its bourse filing.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue contracted 39.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM258.87 million from RM427.21 million.</p>
      <p>For the cumulative nine months (9MFY19), the Mercedes-Benz distributor recorded a net loss of RM16.95 million against a net profit of RM17.82 million in the same period the previous year. Revenue shrank 28.8% to RM862.54 million from RM1.21 billion a year ago.</p>
      <p>C&amp;C blamed the net loss on its Mercedes-Benz operations, which recorded a net loss of RM28.2 million for 9MFY19 compared to a net profit of RM6.6 million in the prior year. It attributed this to lower unit sales which declined by 33% and reduced margins due to a shift in sales mix to lower-priced models and weak consumer demand.</p>
      <p>On prospects, it said the outlook for the rest of the year remains very challenging, with sluggish consumer demand and continued pressure on margins.</p>
      <p>Following a business review amidst the current subdued economic outlook and consumer sentiment in Malaysia, the group said it will not proceed with the planned construction of a Sales, Service, Spare parts facility (3-S Centre) on the plot of Sungai Besi land purchased previously.</p>
      <p>It added that this decision was arrived at after having considered the changes in market dynamics arising from new decisions and delays relating to the integrated transit-oriented development Bandar Malaysia project. Management is exploring the various options available in relation to this plot of land so as to determine the best course of action from a financial return perspective.</p>
      <p>Shares in C&amp;C closed one sen or 0.75% higher at RM1.35 to give the auto dealer a market value of RM136 million. The counter has eased some 28.2% from RM1.88 a year ago.</p>
