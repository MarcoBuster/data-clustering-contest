      <h1>Donald Trump Switches Primary Residence from New York to Florida</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump, a lifelong New Yorker, has switched his primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Florida, according to the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-lifelong-new-yorker-declares-himself-a-resident-of-florida/ar-AAJFly0"><i>New York Times</i></a>.</h2>

      <p>Documents filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court show the president and first lady Melania Trump submitted a “declaration of domicile” stating their permanent residence is the Mar-a-Lago Club.</p>
      <p>“If I maintain another place or places of abode in some other state or states, I hereby declare that my above-described residence and abode in the State of Florida constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such,” the president’s document reportedly reads. “I formerly resided at 721 Fifth Avenue,” the filing adds in reference to Trump Tower in New York.</p>
      <p>An unnamed source conveyed to the<i> Times</i> that the couple’s decision to change his primary residence was for tax purposes.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, President Trump confirmed the switch, stating he was “treated very badly by the political leaders” of New York.</p>

      <p>Shortly after news broke of the move, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) took to Twitter, quipping: “Good riddance.”</p>
      <p>“It’s not like <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a> paid taxes here anyway,” the anti-Trump politician added. “He’s all yours, Florida.”</p>
