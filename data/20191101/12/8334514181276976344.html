      <p>THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Netherlands - one of the European Union’s biggest polluters - looks set to miss its own target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade, its main environmental advisory body said on Friday.</p>

      <p>A recent raft of environmental initiatives would cut emissions to 43%-48% below 1990 levels by 2030, if the plans are all rolled out on time, research institute PBL said.</p>
      <p>But that would be less than the 49% target that Dutch authorities have set for 2030. The EU-wide goal for CO2 emissions over the next 10 years is a 40% cut.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands - home to many large industries, Europe’s main seaport and an abundant supply of cheap natural gas - was fifth in the rankings of the bloc’s top CO2 emitters per capita in 2017, ahead of Germany and Poland.</p>
      <p>The government presented a range of measures in July to reach its climate goals - which ultimately aim to make the Dutch economy almost completely carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
      <p>Those measures include an emissions tax for industry, subsidies to stimulate home insulation, the banning of coal fired power plants and a major push for solar, wind and other sustainable sources of energy.</p>
      <p>But the plans have yet to be implemented and many details remain unclear.</p>
      <p>“Work has got to start now”, the PBL said. “Energy companies, industries, home and car owners, farmers and governments: we all need to get going.”</p>
      <p>Emissions in the Netherlands were 15% lower than in 1990 last year, and are expected to be reduced by around 23% next year.</p>
      <p>“We are not the only country missing their climate goals”, the PBL’s chief climate researcher Pieter Boot told reporters.</p>
      <p>He said other countries including Germany, Britain and France still had to make clear how they are going to make good on their own ambitious promises.</p>
