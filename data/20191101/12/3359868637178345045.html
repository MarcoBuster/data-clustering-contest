      <h1>Diablo 4 Looks Up to Cult Classic Diablo 2 for Inspiration, a Leak Reveals</h1>
      <h2>It is expected that Diablo 4 will channel the same elements and features that made Diablo 2 a cult classic.</h2>

      <p>A reliable source published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/dpgwmv/diablo_4_information_leak_spoiler/">Reddit post</a> on October 30 stating that Diablo 4 will channel the same elements that developed Diablo 2 into a cult classic. The source has a known and undisputed track record. Thus, it is credited with a level of legitimacy that is mostly absent in other wild rumors.</p>
      <p>Previously, they correctly predicted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/bwwe7d/pokemon_sword_n_shield_info/">Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/blym26/new_ghost_recon_game_leak/">Ghost Recon Breakpoint</a> details way before official announcements. Daniel Ahmad, a respected industry analyst, posted on Twitter that the details correlate with a lot of what he is currently aware of Diablo 4. That seems to be a decent seal of approval from other sources.</p>
      <h3>Diablo 4 Features Vast Locations and a Darker Tone</h3>
      <p>The leak goes further to say that Diablo 4 will adopt a gloomier tone compared to the previous entry. A huge emphasis is placed on ‘toned down’ locations that appear bigger with an open-world component. They include ‘plagued’ cities, caves, wastelands, deserts, crypts, and wetlands.</p>
      <p>As for the finer details, the leak published that characters will ride horses and other mounts. Moreover, there are contextual interactions with the surroundings like climbing a wall Lost Ark style. In this latest edition, the blood splatters resemble real blood and not splashed jam.</p>
      <p>Through that leak, everyone is convinced that the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/diablo-4-is-one-big-throwback-to-diablo-2-according-to-latest-blizzcon-2019-leak/">Diablo 4 gameplay</a> is more dynamic than Diablo 3. It will feature smoother animations and combat that seems weighty and impactful. Three known classes in Diablo 4 exist. They include a melee barbarian class, an elemental magic-wielding mage class, and a druid class with the ability to shape-shifting into various beasts.</p>
      <p>Four-player co-op returns to Diablo 4. Also, the leak implies player vs. player combat may feature at launch.</p>
      <h3>Revisiting Diablo 2</h3>
      <p>According to the same leak, many Diablo 2-like aspects exist in Diablo 4. That news will surely excite the franchise fans. The source <a href="https://www.ccn.com/diablo-4-channel-cult-classic-diablo-2-leak/">explained</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Lilith being the new diablo (she is covered in blood veil kind of), characters are shown sitting at a campfire as character selection, nitty-gritty dark style that 2 was praised for, some skills also seem to be just taken from it and put in here (like sorceress’ charged bolt).”</blockquote>
      <p>A salt dose is a prerequisite as always. Nonetheless, as we have <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blizzard-entertainment-diablo/">reported</a> earlier, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blizzard/">Blizzard</a> will officially launch Diablo 4 during BlizzCon, fans will not have to wait for long to get confirmation.</p>
      <p>The event started on October 31 with an announcement scheduled for November 1 at the earliest unless stated otherwise. Many fans are hopeful that this year’s event will not turn out to be as strange as 2018’s Diablo Immortal announcement.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth mentioning that the stock of Blizzard is now demonstrating a positive tendency and continuously growing (though without huge jumps). At the moment Activision Blizzard (ATVI) stock is trading at around $56.</p>
