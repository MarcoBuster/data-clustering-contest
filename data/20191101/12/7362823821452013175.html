      <h1>'Westworld' actor Jeffrey Wright compares Donald Trump to Charles Manson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:44:33+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:44</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler McCarthy</a></address>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">Westworld</a>” actor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Jeffrey Wright</a> compared <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Donald Trump</a> to infamous cult leader <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/charles-manson">Charles Manson</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The first tweet Wright sent was a video of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/devin-nunes">Rep. Devin Nunes</a> speaking on the House floor, defending Trump against his opponents' ongoing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">push for impeachment</a>. Nunes compares <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">Democrats</a> and the media to cult followers.</p>

      <p>“But they have no evidence and no argument to support impeachment. All they have is the unconditional cooperation of the media to advance their preposterous narrative,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jfreewright/status/1190084088184655872">he says</a>. “If they had a real case, they wouldn’t be wasting time spoon-feeding ridiculous attacks that include defamation and slander on both current and former staff on the intelligence committee.”</p>

      <p>He continues: “What we’re seeing among Democrats on the Intelligence Committee down in the SCIF right now is like a cult,” Nunes is seen saying in a video attached to Wright’s tweet. “These are a group of people loyally following their leader as he bounces from one outlandish conspiracy theory to another. And the media are the cult followers.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Wright’s second video turns Nunes’ cult comments on their heads by showing Trump and Manson side-by-side making similar facial expressions.</p>
      <p>“Happy Halloween, I guess, folks,” Wright captioned the tweet.</p>
      <p>The actor, who <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/matt-reeves-confirms-jeffrey-wright-will-be-commissioner-gordon-in-the-batman/">The Wrap</a> reports will play Commissioner Gordon in “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/robert-pattinson-the-batman">The Batman</a>,” struck a more celebratory tone earlier in the day when he tweeted about the House passing a resolution to set ground rules for the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.</p>
      <p>“*I’m November 6, 2018, and I approve this message.* Democracy, baby. VOTE,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jfreewright/status/1189934285349937153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1189934285349937153&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fentertainment%2F2019%2F10%2F31%2Fhollywood-celebrates-impeachment-vote-lets-get-on-with-it-shall-we%2F">Wright, 53, tweeted</a>.</p>

      <p>The measure passed largely along party lines, 232-196. Two Democrats defected on the vote.</p>

      <p>The first formal floor vote in relation to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a> probe announced last month by Speaker Nancy Pelosi followed a fierce debate in the chamber, where Republicans accused Democrats of launching a de facto "coup" against the president in a "pre-ordained" bid to overturn the results of the 2016 election.</p>
