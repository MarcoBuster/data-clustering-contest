      <p>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Kevin Hart have reunited for the final Jumanji: The Next Level trailer.</p>

      <p>This time around the video game world they explore is different to what they have seen before, leaving some of the characters in the wrong avatars.</p>
      <p>DeVito’s character finds himself in Johnson’s body and, examining his muscled physique, says: “I think my eyes are a different colour.”</p>
      <p>“All of you is a different colour,” Hart quips.</p>
      <p>Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle was a surprise box office hit, grossing 962 million US dollars (about £742 million) worldwide.</p>
      <p>That film was a reboot of 1995’s Jumanji, which starred Robin Williams.</p>
      <p>Jumanji: The Next Level will be released in UK cinemas on December 11.</p>
