      <h1>Argentina’s Central Bank Bans Bitcoin Purchases With Credit Cards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:51:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Martin</a></address>
      <p>After recently imposing limits on U.S. dollar purchases, the Central Bank of Argentina (BCA) <a href="https://www.infobae.com/economia/2019/10/31/el-banco-central-limito-el-acceso-a-dolares-para-los-argentinos-que-viaje-al-exterior/">announced Oct. 31</a>, that citizens are prohibited from using credit cards to buy Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) or other cryptocurrencies. The news was initially reported by <a href="https://br.cointelegraph.com/news/banco-central-da-argentina-proibe-uso-de-cartao-de-credito-para-comprar-bitcoin">Cointelegraph Brazil</a> on Nov. 1. </p>
      <h3>All in the name of preserving forex reserves</h3>
      <p>The measures were published in a communication covering several industries in which credit card use was limited or prohibited. The section referring to cryptocurrency reads:</p>
      <blockquote>“Acquisition of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies: It is prohibited to purchase BTC with this payment method. The only remaining alternative for this investment is to do so with funds transferred from a bank account.”</blockquote>
      <p>It is unclear whether the rules apply only to credit cards or if this includes debit and prepaid cards.</p>
      <p>The BCA says that these measures are critical to preserving the country’s foreign exchange reserves.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin just part of a wide-ranging crackdown</h3>
      <p>According to experts, the central bank intends to block the entry of dollars into the country, seeking to have stronger exchange control. </p>
      <p>This follows a move by the BCA earlier this week, which limited the amount of U.S. Dollars Argentinian citizens could buy each month. The maximum amount was reduced from $10,000 to just $200.</p>
      <p>At the time this <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-trading-spikes-as-argentina-bans-buying-more-than-200-a-month">caused a spike</a> in Bitcoin trading, which these latest measures would seem to partially address.</p>
