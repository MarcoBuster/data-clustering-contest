      <h3>Bitcoin shows firm $9K support</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 put the largest cryptocurrency at around $9,200 as of press time Friday, with 24-hour performance seeing it dip as low as $9,060.</p>

      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/deribit-to-pay-users-13m-after-bitcoin-price-flash-crash-to-77k">reported</a>, technical problems on two major exchanges appeared to spark brief panic on markets. After reaching around $9,365, BTC/USD saw a sharp dip across the board. </p>
      <p>On Friday, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-bitmex-may-have-just-leaked-all-of-their-users-emails">another scare</a>, this time involving a user data leak at cryptocurrency derivatives giant <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmex">BitMEX</a>, delivered comparatively little impact.</p>
      <p>The recovery thus places Bitcoin back in the middle of the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-dips-below-9k-support-as-traders-weigh-correction-odds">range</a> it has traded in for almost one a week. Prior to that, a bull run had taken it to almost $10,500. </p>
      <p>Now, analysts forecast a continuation of the pattern. According to Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van der Poppe</a>, such behavior is realistic.</p>
      <p>“And $BTC continues the ranging, which is extremely fine,” he summarized in <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1189876785435025408">Twitter</a> comments on Thursday.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-tests-9k-as-analyst-eyes-significant-indicator-cross">noted</a>, fellow contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/filbfilb">filbfilb</a> also believes the trend will continue through H1 next year, with BTC/USD set to stay range bound between $7,500 and $10,000.</p>
      <h3>Altcoins contemplative in a sideways market</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoins</a> meanwhile saw a remarkably calm day, with major tokens barely moving from the previous day’s position.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin by market cap, gained 0.8% to trade near $182. Others in the top twenty cryptocurrencies fared similarly, moving up or down by a maximum of around 1%.</p>
