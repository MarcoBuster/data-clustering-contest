      <h3>Preview</h3>
      <p>The Highlanders are coming after a hard-fought draw against champions <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bengaluru_fc">Bengaluru FC</a> away from home and a win against ISL new entrants Odisha FC. Meanwhile, the Gaurs are marching into Guwahati with the same four points as the Highlanders. The in-from Goan side has thrashed <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chennaiyin_fc">Chennaiyin FC</a> in their first match and drew with Bengaluru, but they have injuries to their key foreign players. It will be a match of equal powers and NorthEast United have a slight advantage with its home support and an injury-less side.</p>
      <h3>Key Players</h3>
      <p>NEUFC’s striker Asamoah Gyan is one of the best players in this ISL. He has scored against Odisha FC and has struck the woodwork in the previous game. The Ghanian all-time top scorer is supported by Indian midfielder Redeem Thang, who scored a quick goal against Odisha.</p>
      <p>Foreigners Panagiotis Triadis is also a crucial player for NorthEast at the midfield and he has been ably supported by captain Jose Leudo, who will be crucial in marking Coro. </p>
      <p>For the Gaurs, undoubtedly, Coro will be the man to lead the attacks. The all-time ISL top scorer will be supported by Indians Len Doungel and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/jackichand_singh">Jackichand Singh</a> at the wings. Goalkeeper Muhammed Nawaz is also in good form for the Goan side. Foreign defenders Mourtada Fall and Carlos Pena will coordinate the defensive duties.</p>
      <h3>Team News</h3>
      <p>Robert Jarni has a fit squad to choose from, a luxury other ISL teams hardly have.  However, Uruguayan midfielder Federico Gallego is injured and ruled out, which has been a huge loss.</p>
      <p>On the other side, Goa has injuries to their key foreign players  Edu Bedia and Hugo Boumous is still doubtful for the match, although Spanish coach Lobera didn’t seem worried.</p>
      <h3>Head to Head</h3>
      <p>Both teams faced 10 times and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/fc_goa">FC Goa</a> have won more with 4 wins. NorthEast United could only manage two wins and the rest four went to draw.</p>
