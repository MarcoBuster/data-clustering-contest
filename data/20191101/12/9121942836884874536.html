      <p>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — California Sen. Kamala Harris is winding down her presidential campaign’s efforts in New Hampshire.</p>
      <p>The entire New Hampshire field organizing team was laid off, and three field offices are also closing. That’s according to the Harris campaign’s New Hampshire spokesman.</p>
      <p>Harris has spent little time in New Hampshire since announcing her presidential run, but she has drawn crowds during her handful of visits to the state.</p>
      <p>Plans for Harris to visit New Hampshire next week have also been canceled, including a stop for her to file for the primary in Concord on Nov. 7. The campaign says her name will still be placed on the ballot.</p>
