      <p><a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/jenelle-evans/">Jenelle Evans</a> is filing for divorce from husband David Eason five months after he <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/05/01/teen-mom-star-jenelle-evans-husband-kills-their-dog-for-allegedly-biting-daughter/">killed her dog</a>.</p>
      <p>The former “Teen Mom” star <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ShD7nlZ8K/">announced on Instagram</a> Friday that she is splitting from Eason after two years of marriage because she wants “what’s best for my kids and I want to be happy.”</p>
      <p>Evans and Eason share 2-year-old daughter Ensley. The pair also have three children, respectively, from previous relationships. Evans was married to Courtland Rogers from 2012 to 2014.</p>

      <p>“With time away from Teen Mom I’ve started to look at my life differently and I know I need to make changes,” said Evans, 27. “I’m starting that now. The kids and I have moved away from David.”</p>
      <p>The reality star shared that she and her children are “doing great” despite the breakup.</p>
      <p>“We need some time to be together,” she continued. “But you’ll hear from us again soon.”</p>

      <p>Eason <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/09/10/jenelle-evans-husband-david-eason-admits-he-killed-her-dog/">admitted to killing</a> Evans’ French bulldog, Nugget, in September after the pooch allegedly snapped at Ensley.</p>
      <p>“The dog was aggressive,” Eason <a href="https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-husband-david-eason-confirms-he-killed-dog/">told People</a>. “She might not be huge or whatever, but you know when a dog bites a child on the face more than one time, then it should never be around the child again.”</p>
      <p>The Columbus County Sheriff’s Office <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/05/02/teen-mom-stars-husband-under-investigation-for-animal-cruelty/">investigated Eason</a> for animal cruelty, but closed the case, alleging that the couple <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/07/11/jenelle-evans-allegedly-made-up-dog-killing-for-the-publicity-police-say/">filed a report for publicity</a>.</p>
