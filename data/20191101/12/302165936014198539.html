      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 1 — German Chancellor Angela Merkel will host US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for talks in Berlin next Friday, a government spokeswoman said, as US forces resumed border patrols in northeast Syria.</p>
      <p>Pompeo’s visit comes after yesterday’s return by US troops to patrol part of Syria’s border with Turkey after a pullout ordered by US President Donald Trump that had opened the way for a Turkish assault.</p>
      <p>“Alongside the bilateral relationship, current international questions” will be on the agenda at Merkel’s office, spokeswoman Martina Fietz told reporters.</p>
      <p>Pompeo also has meetings scheduled with Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas, finance minister Olaf Scholz and defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.</p>
      <p>Fietz declined to say whether the pair would discuss Kramp-Karrenbauer’s suggestion for international troops to set up a “security zone” in north-east Syria.</p>
      <p>The defence chief’s suggestion has provoked discord in German politics, with foreign minister Maas blasted by MPs for calling it “unrealistic” on a visit to Turkey last week.</p>
      <p>Maas had pointed to the reality on the ground, where Kurdish fighters have ceded ground to Turkish and Syrian troops as well as Russian units allied with the Damascus government.</p>
      <p>Friday saw the first joint patrols between Ankara and Moscow’s soldiers under a deal struck to ensure the Kurds departed.</p>
      <p>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad rejected the idea of a UN-mandated security zone in a state television interview yesterday.</p>
      <p>“We haven noted Mr Assad’s comments but they change nothing about the federal government’s stated position on security and stability in the region,” Fietz said. — AFP</p>
