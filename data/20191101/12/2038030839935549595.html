      <p>Bringing the Emmy-winning series to a conclusion, the third season takes us back to 1985. VHS has become the primary medium for pornography, and the AIDS epidemic has changed the industry. With the party of the 1970s winding down, barkeeps, prostitutes, pimps, police, mobsters, porn actors and producers take us on a gripping journey into the sleaziest corners of Times Square. The series stars James Franco, Maggie Gyllenhaal and David Simon.</p>
