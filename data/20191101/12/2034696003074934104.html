      <p>It’s only been a day since Halloween, but <a href="http://nme.com/artists/mariah-carey">Mariah Carey</a> is already getting ready for Christmas.</p>
      <p>The ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ singer has marked the start of the festive season by sharing a video clip which sees her receiving a phone call from Santa.</p>
      <p>In the clip, Mariah is seen going to bed on 31 October in a spooky wig, after attending Heidi Klum’s Halloween party.</p>
      <p>As she wakes up, she magically appears to have slipped into her Christmas pyjamas as the phone begins to ring.</p>
      <p>“Santa, it’s time…,” she says.</p>

      <p>Her love of the festive season is well established – ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’ is the biggest-selling Christmas song in the US since 2003 after shifting 15 million copies.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>But despite her apparent seasonal cheer, she revealed last year that she won’t <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/mariah-carey-wont-play-want-christmas-thanks-giving-2403842">play the festive track until after Thanksgiving.</a></p>
      <p>“I have this rule where I try to get through Thanksgiving. I don’t like when people rush it because once I start I don’t stop until after New Year,” she told Jimmy Kimmel.</p>
      <p>Recent reports have suggested that Mariah makes upwards of  £376,000 from ‘All I Want For Christmas’ per year.</p>
