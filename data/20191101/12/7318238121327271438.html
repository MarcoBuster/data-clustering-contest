      <h1>UK announces up to €22 million in support of Lebanon's army</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:25:43+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:25</time> by <a rel="author">Cristina Abellan Matamoros</a></address>
      <p>The UK has announced up to $25 million (€22 million) in aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces for the 2019-2022 period as part of their "ongoing support to the sole legitimate defender of Lebanon," the British embassy in Lebanon tweeted on Friday.</p>
      <p>Officials told Reuters on Thursday that Donald Trump's administration was withholding $105 million (€94 million) in security aid for Lebanon — two days after the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri.</p>
      <p>The officials did not tell Reuters why the aid was being blocked. The State Department did not provide a comment to Reuters either.</p>
      <p>Washington has repeatedly expressed concern over the growing role of Hezbollah in the Lebanese government. The Shia group backed by Iran and listed as a terrorist organisation by the US.</p>
      <p>A US official told Reuters that it was important to maintain security assistance in Lebanon as the continent is located in a turbulent region and houses thousands of Syrian refugees.</p>
      <p>The official highlighted it was important to strengthen Lebanon's military.</p>
      <p>"The security forces are entrusted with keeping Lebanon safe - including securing the borders, stopping terrorism and protecting peaceful protests," said the British embassy tweet.</p>

      <p>After Hariri's resignation, which was propelled by nationwide anti-government protest, Lebanese President Michel Aoun called for the formation of a new government of technocrats.</p>
      <p>"Ministers should be chosen according to their competencies and expertise, not political loyalties," Aoun said in a televised address to mark the completion of three years in office.</p>
      <p>"Lebanon is at a critical juncture, especially in terms of its economy," he said.</p>
