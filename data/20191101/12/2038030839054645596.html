      <p>Cape Town - Get ready emo kids! Your favourite band is getting back together! </p>
      <p>After years and years of speculation, it has been confirmed My Chemical Romance will reunite for one show, at least, at the Shrine Expo Hall in Los Angeles. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/my-chemical-romance-reunion-show-906464/"><b>Speculation was at its highest</b></a> earlier this year when Joe Jonas claimed My Chemical Romance had been rehearsing in the studio next door to the Jonas Brothers, which guitarist Frank Iero later denied.</p>
      <p>The show - taking place on 20 December - will be the band's first since 2012. </p>
      <p>My Chemical Romance released their last album, <i>Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</i> in 2010.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the reunion gig go on sale Friday via AXS. </p>
