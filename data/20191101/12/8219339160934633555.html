      <h1>Apple TV+ Guide: Here’s all the Apple TV shows and movies available now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:00:18+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benjaminmayo/" target="_blank">Benjamin Mayo</a></address>
      <p>Apple TV+ offers exclusive Apple original TV shows and movies in 4K HDR quality. You can watch across all of your screens and pick up where you left off on any device. Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, and a single subscription can be shared with your entire family through Family Sharing at no additional cost. Buyers of a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, or iPod touch are eligible for a free year of Apple TV+.</p>
      <p>When the year is up, the subscription renews at the standard $4.99 per month rate. But exactly what do you get for your money? Here’s every television show and movie available right now on Apple TV+, as well as a look at what’s coming soon …</p>
      <p>Apple TV+ content is available exclusively through the Apple TV app. You can watch on your Apple TV set-top box, iPhone, or iPad as you might expect.</p>
      <p>The TV app is also available on other platforms like Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and even the web at <a href="http://tv.apple.com/">tv.apple.com</a>. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/24/apple-tv-app-devices/">Read this post</a> for more details on everywhere you can watch Apple TV.</p>
      <p>Apple TV+ offers original comedies, dramas, thrillers, documentaries, and kids shows. However, unlike most other streaming services, Apple TV+ does not include a back catalog of any kind.</p>
      <p>For your $4.99/month subscription, you can watch all of Apple’s originals — as listed below. You can download to watch offline too. Right now, the library of Apple originals in terms of raw numbers is quite small. Expect to see the Apple TV+ library grow quickly, as Apple has committed to adding new originals every month.</p>
