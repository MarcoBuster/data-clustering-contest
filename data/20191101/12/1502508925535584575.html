      <h1>Instagram unveils initiative to mentor creators across 15 cities in India</h1>
      <h2>Creators will be mentored under the 'Born on Instagram' initiative, Vishal Shah, Instagram's VP of Products</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:16:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>Facebook-owned <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/instagram">Instagram </a>is gearing up to mentor talents across 15 cities in India as the platform focuses on enhancing shopping experience for its users in the country with Augmented Reality (AR), a top company executive said here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Creators will be mentored under the "Born on Instagram" initiative, Vishal Shah, Instagram's VP of Products, told reporters here.</p>
      <p>"Right now, people can discover products on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/instagram">Instagram </a>but they cannot buy them directly in the app. In the US, we are testing payment integration so that users can directly shop in the app," said Shah.</p>
      <p>"We want to bring this feature to more markets," he added, without giving any timeline for the launch of the feature in India.</p>
      <p>Showcasing how Augmented Reality (AR) can improve the shopping experience, Shah said that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/instagram">Instagram </a>has collaborated with a few brands that focus on beauty products on the new feature.</p>
      <p>The feature allows users to try in a virtual scenario how new products will look on them before making the purchase.</p>
      <p>Instagram said it would collaborate with more brands on the feature in the future .</p>
      <p>As WhatsApp plans to launch digital payments feature in India, integrating it with Instagram could provide a huge boost for the creators' community on the photo and video-sharing platform.</p>
      <p>Shah said that Instagram is working on hiding the like button from the feed.</p>
      <p>"Instagram is a platform for expression. It's not a contest.</p>
      <p>"But people will express only when they feel safe. So safety is core to everything we do," he added.</p>
      <p>While the Restrict feature allows users to prevent online bullies reaching them, the platform also alerts users to review comment if it includes objectionable content.</p>
      <p>Instagram's Threads feature allows users to interact only with close friends within the platform's messaging ecosystem. The feature allows users complete control over who they interact with.</p>
      <p>Globally, over a billion people use Instagram.</p>
      <p>A report by digital media agency WATConsult's Recogn last month said that 84 per cent of Instagram users globally are likely to shop using the photo-sharing platform.</p>
      <p>More than 75 per cent of the shoppers said they had a satisfactory experience while shopping from the platform and most are likely to shop in the future.</p>
