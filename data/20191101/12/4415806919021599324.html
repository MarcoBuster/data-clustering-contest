      <h1>New rules for car insurance to give customers greater transparency</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:36:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Central Bank is introducing strict new rules for car insurance from today.</p>
      <p>Under the regulations, insurers must tell their customers the premium they paid the previous year, in clear writing, on the same page as their new quote.</p>
      <p>From this morning, new rules being introduced by the Central Bank mean that insurers must now provide their customers with more information when renewing their motor insurance policies.</p>
      <p>It says it will give greater transparency to customers to help them to make informed decisions when purchasing insurance.</p>
      <p>Gr√°inne McEvoy, Director of Consumer Protection at the Central Bank, says it is about giving customers clarity.</p>
      <p>"I think greater transparency is always what a customer is looking for," says Ms McEvoy.</p>
      <p>"The ability to make a comparison between what your policy is costing you today versus what it cost you last year is a really important piece of information.</p>
      <p>"It allows you a customer to make a more informed decision."</p>
      <p>They will also have to give a quote for each policy available, such as comprehensive, third party fire and theft cover, or third party only.</p>
      <p>The renewal period is being extended from 15 to 20 days to allow policyholders more time to shop around.</p>
      <p>That applies not only to car insurance, but also to health, damage to property and general liability insurance.</p>
