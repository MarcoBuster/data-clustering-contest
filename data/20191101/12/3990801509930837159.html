        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>As a kid, I watched a lot of <i>The Jetsons and</i> was fascinated by how they could control their high-tech homes with a press of a button or by simple voice commands.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, because of smartphones, AI assistants, and IoT devices, we can now easily do that as well. That’s why if you’re wondering about getting started on the smart home journey, I have the perfect deal for you.</p>
      <p>The Amazon Echo Dot (third gen) bundled with LIFX smart bulb bundle is selling for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07X57R8XW?th=1/?tag=tnw88-20">just $35</a>, instead of $70. That’s a steal deal.</p>
      <p>The third-gen smart speaker can be a great bedside buddy with timely reminders and alarms. You can also get your news in the morning, or play your favorite morning playlist when you wake up.</p>
      <p>The bundle also contains a LIFX mini smart bulb that directly connects to your Wi-Fi. So you can control it with your voice through Alexa, and your phone as well.</p>
      <p>In case you don’t want the LIFX bulb, you can still get the Echo Dot for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07X57R8XW/?tag=tnw88-20">just $30</a>, that’s $20 off its original price. But, you shouldn’t miss out on this deal, where you can get a smart bulb for just an additional $5. Get the Amazon Echo Dot (third gen) bundled with LIFX smart bulb bundle for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07X57R8XW?th=1/?tag=tnw88-20">just $35</a> ($35 off).</p>
