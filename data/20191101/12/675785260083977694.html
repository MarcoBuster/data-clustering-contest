      <p>A Chinese mother has admitted to smacking her eight-year-old daughter with a belt because she didn't do her homework 'properly'.</p>
      <p>The unnamed woman, who lives in Queensland, Australia, defended her actions by saying that the practice was acceptable in her home country.</p>
      <p>She carried out the cruel punishment because her daughter was not completing her homework assignments correctly.</p>
      <p>The girl has since been taken out of her care after child protection services became involved, reports the <a href="https://www.qt.com.au/">Queensland Times</a> .</p>

      <p>The mother pleaded guilty in Ipswich Magistrates Court to assaulting a child when armed with an instrument, causing bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer Matthew Fairclough told the court that the child alleged she had been treated inappropriately.</p>
      <p>"Child Safety took a view of the matter that the children should not remain in her care," he said.</p>
      <p>"Her husband is here with her (in the courtroom). It has proven to be quite troubling for the family.</p>
      <p>"It has been a significant wake-up call for both parents."</p>
      <p>Mr Fairclough said the mother wanted to resume her role as a parent and has taken part in a parenting program.Â </p>
      <p>Magistrate Virginia Sturgess said parents should not beat their children under any circumstances, branding the practice "unacceptable".</p>
      <p>The mother was sentenced to a supervised nine-month probation order.</p>
