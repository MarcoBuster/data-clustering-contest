      <p>Similar to past Pixels before it, this year's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4">Pixel 4</a> has been met with a controversial release. While battery woes have been the main point of contention, there's also been a lot of debate regarding the Pixel 4's face unlock system.</p>
      <p>Face unlock on the Pixel 4 works quite well, and personally, I've been very happy with it. Taking a look through the AC forums, though, that's not the case for everyone.</p>
      <p>In fact, a lot of people really miss having a fingerprint sensor on Google's latest flagship.</p>

But, the fingerprint sensor on the 3XL was still faster and did not force some of the trade-offs associated with Face Unlock. Not to mention that none of my apps (banking, password manager, etc.) support Face Unlock at this time and no idea when or even if they ever will. I don't know why Google chose to eliminate the FPS... Reply</a>

Too many tradeoffs and the fingerprint is just as fast. Even if someone argues its not, it would be only milliseconds behind. And I still wouldn't have to pull it up to my face or have all the false openings when I just want to check the time. Watch google bring it back next year with one of those garbage in-screen fingerprint readers,... Reply</a>

So non issue for me. But if LastPass wouldn't have supported then not sure if I could have used this as... Reply</a>
