      <p>But perhaps the strangest item is the <a href="https://www.hammacher.com/product/marble-machine-orchestra?promo=the-unexpected">Marble Machine Orchestra</a>, listed at $95,000:</p>
      <blockquote>This is the mechanical musical apparatus made in Sweden that generates mellifluous melodies with a multitude of marbles. Constructed from birch plywood and steel, it is comprised of gears, pulleys, tracks, lifting fingers, and funnels that work in concert to generate the precisely timed release of marbles which strike instruments. The entire operation begins by turning the handcrank to set the 18" flywheel into motion, which stores rotational energy and provides the musician a way to keep even time. Working similarly to a music box, the machine's marbles strike the keys of the built-in vibraphone, the four strings of an electric bass guitar, a kick drum, snare drum, hi hat, one-stringed modulin, and a sizzle cymbal—the operator pushes/pulls a series of levers to activate/deactivate a particular instrument. The programming wheel contains a 64-bar loop, which makes the device similar in operation to the Orchestrions of yesteryear.</blockquote>
