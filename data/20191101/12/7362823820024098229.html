      <p>An <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia">Indonesian</a> man who helped draft the country’s strict adultery laws – which includes public flogging – was caught having an affair with a married woman and fell victim to the laws he created.</p>
      <p>Mukhlis bin Muhammad, 46, was apparently caught by officials in September having sex with an unnamed married woman in a car parked near a tourist beach, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50258727">BBC</a> reported.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Mukhlis was caned 28 times in Aech, a semi-autonomous province on the northwest tip of Sumatra Island that still practices strict <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion/islam">Sharia</a> law.</p>

      <p>“This is God’s law. Anyone must be flogged if proven guilty, even if he is a member of the MPU,” Husaini Wahab, the deputy mayor of Aceh Besar district, told the BBC.</p>
      <p>The MPU – or Aceh Ulema Council – advises local governments and legislature on drafting and implementing Sharia law.</p>

      <p>Aceh is the only province in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country that imposes Sharia law. It was adopted in 2001. Under the current legislature, suspects can be flogged for a range of offenses including gambling, drinking alcohol, gay sex, sex before marriage and extramarital affairs.</p>

      <p>“This law is designated to have a deterrent effect, not only for the offenders but for the spectators who watch the caning,” Marwan, the head of the local public order agency, told reporters (via <a href="https://www.news.com.au/world/asia/man-responsible-for-indonesias-public-floggings-for-sharia-law-breaches-gets-public-flogging/news-story/818b5cccaf8a3839294d30e9966a2923">news.com.au</a>). “The pain of being flogged is not that bad, the embarrassment is worse.”</p>

      <p>According to Husaini, Mukhlis is also an Islamic religious leader – making him the first to be publicly caned in Aceh since the law came into force.</p>
      <p>He said Mukhlis will also be expelled from the MPU for his actions.</p>
