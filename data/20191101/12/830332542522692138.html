      <p>(CNN) - If Godzilla movies aren't scary enough for you, head to Japan next year and you can get eaten by the fearsome lizard himself.</p>
      <p>The Nijigen no Mori theme park on Awaji Island in Hyogo prefecture will debut a Godzilla-themed area in 2020, complete with a massive lizard measuring 20 meters (65 feet) high, 25 meters (82 feet) wide and 55 meters (180 feet) long -- the exact size of the one in the movies.</p>
      <p>That means that that Nijigen no Mori will be the first place to have a permanent, full-size replica of the famed movie monster.</p>
      <p>"Godzilla Interception Operation" will feature several activities, including a zipline that will feed you right into the monster's mouth and a shooting game where, presumably, you're aiming at Godzilla himself.</p>
      <p>The activities are called "missions," and visitors will be asked for their help in capturing or defeating Godzilla. And, of course, there will be a gift shop.</p>
      <p>As for the location, it was very intentional.</p>
      <p>"The legendary figure of Godzilla was first confirmed at the beginning of the Meiji era when a typhoon hit Awaji Island," reads a blog post on the theme park's website. "Godzilla, who appeared with the high waves, roamed the island, causing tremendous damage."</p>
      <p>The first Godzilla movie was introduced to the US in 1954, inspiring multiple remakes that all rely on the thrill of watching an enormous lizard wreak devastation on human landscapes.</p>
      <p>In addition to becoming the home -- er, containment area -- of the world's deadliest giant lizard, Nijigen no Mori also has rides and exhibits based on Japanese anime and cartoon characters like Crayon Shinchan.</p>
      <p>Regular updates on the Godzilla Interception Operation will be posted on the themed area's <a href="https://twitter.com/GODZILLA_AWAJI">Japanese-language Twitter account</a>.</p>
      <p>Awaji Island is in the Bay of Osaka, close to Kobe and Naruto.</p>
      <p>Godzilla fans in visiting Japan can also visit Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood, whereHotel Gracery's 12-meter (39-foot) replica Godzilla head spits "fire" at visitors throughout the day.</p>
      <p>Guests at the hotel can request a stay in one of the themed rooms, with perfect views (and photo ops) of the lizard head on the eighth floor.</p>
      <p>Next year will also mark the release of the latest Godzilla flick, Godzilla vs. Kong, which will be in English and star Millie Bobby Brown and Kyle Chandler.</p>
