      <p>The Brit's statistics are mind-boggling, with 87 pole positions and 83 wins in F1 and he is rightly described as one of the greatest F1 has ever seen, and Vettel agrees with this statement.</p>
      <p>He told motorsport.com:Â <i>"How can we think differently? For me it is very clear, he absolutely is [one of the best].</i></p>

        <i>"He has been in this sport for a long time, and he is one of the most successful drivers. After Michael, I believe it is right to have his name, although obviously the judgements are personal.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Formula 1 today has changed, there are many more races, and consequently you have the chance to win more than in the past, which is why I believe it is not correct to compare the achievements, to name names like [Alberto] Ascari or [Juan Manuel] Fangio.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Every driver must be judged in his time and Lewis is undoubtedly a great professional who stood out among all the drivers of his generation."</i>
