      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - A high-ranking member of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club from Massachusetts has been charged with illegal possession of a gun.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors say 48-year-old Bruce Sartwell was held after his initial court appearance Wednesday pending a detention hearing scheduled for Friday.</p>
      <p>Sartwell, who according to authorities is the regional president of the Brockton/East Bridgewater Chapter of the Outlaws, was arrested after authorities say they found an AR-15 style "ghost gun" at his East Bridgewater home. A "ghost gun" is a firearm without any manufacturing or serial numbers.</p>
      <p>As a previously convicted felon, he is not allowed to possess guns.</p>
      <p>According to a Department of Homeland Security affidavit, the Outlaws are currently involved in a "violent feud" with the Hells Angels.</p>
      <p>Sartwell's public defender declined comment.</p>
