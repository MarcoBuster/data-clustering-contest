      <h1>Woman found dead with python wrapped around neck in home with 140 snakes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:56:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Allen Kim and Rebekah Riess, CNN</a></address>
      <p>A woman was found dead with an 8-foot python snake wrapped around her neck, according to Indiana State Police.</p>
      <p>The snake was a reticulated python, which is native to southeast Asia and is considered to be the longest snake in the world.</p>
      <p>The Benton County dispatch in Oxford, Indiana, received a 911 call Wednesday night after Laura Hurst, 36, was found unresponsive.</p>
      <p>Medics arrived and attempted life-saving measures on her but were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>Police say there were 140 snakes at the property, and that approximately 20 of the snakes belong to Hurst. According to police, Hurst frequented the property "about twice a week."</p>
      <p>The home is owned by Benton County Sheriff Donald Munson, according to property records. Munson did not return a CNN call for comment Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Munson told the <a href="https://www.jconline.com/story/news/2019/10/31/python-strangles-woman-house-snakes-owned-benton-county-sheriff-police-say/4111294002/">Lafayette Journal &amp; Courier</a> that Hurst's death was a "tragic accident" and that he was "being fully cooperative with everybody."</p>
      <p>Indiana State Police Sgt. Kim Riley told CNN that no one lives in the home and that it had been renovated and set up specifically for the collection of snakes.</p>
      <p>He said that Hurst was "apparently there checking on her snakes. For whatever reason, she apparently got the snake out and she was doing what people do with snakes."</p>
      <p>Riley said that the snake may have caused Hurst's death and that an autopsy will be performed on Friday to provide an official cause of death.</p>
