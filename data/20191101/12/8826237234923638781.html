      <p>(WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.) — A high school principal in Florida who told a student’s mother “not everyone believes the Holocaust happened” has been fired.</p>
      <p>The Palm Beach County school board voted 5-2 to fire William Latson on ground of “ethical misconduct” and “failure to carry out job responsibilities.” Latson was principal of Spanish River High School in Boca Raton.</p>
      <p>The Palm Beach Post reports the official justification for Latson’s termination was failure to return messages from school district officials in the days after his comments made international news.</p>
      <p>Latson’s attorney has vowed to appeal the decision in state administrative court.</p>
      <p>Several Spanish River teachers spoke on behalf of Latson Wednesday, describing him as a kind and tolerant administrator whose words were twisted in a national media frenzy.</p>
      <p>Latson has been with the district for 26 years.</p>
