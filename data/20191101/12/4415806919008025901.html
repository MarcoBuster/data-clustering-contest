      <p>Business banking is “subdued” in Northern Ireland due to uncertainty around Brexit, Danske Bank has said.</p>
      <p>Demand for lending is below normal levels, the firm’s latest results showed.</p>
      <p>Danske made £71m (€82.5m) pre-tax profit in Northern Ireland during the nine months to September.</p>
      <p>Operating profit is up 3% year on year. Costs were 2% lower.</p>

      <p>Danske Bank UK chief executive Kevin Kingston said: “In business banking, demand for lending continues to be subdued as a result of uncertainty around the stretched Brexit process.</p>
      <p>“It is important to note that our capacity to support new business lending remains strong, but current demand levels are below what we would expect in a more normalised trading environment.</p>
      <p>“There has been a notable uplift in customer requests for support, advice and guidance from our business banking relationship managers – these are conversations we encourage and value.</p>
      <p>“In the short-term, the business community awaits much-needed clarity on what the Brexit journey will look like. However the reality is, whatever shape it takes, it will only be the beginning of a new operating environment, and the process of change will be a significant factor in everybody’s lives for many years to come.”</p>
      <p>Danske is one of the biggest banks in Northern Ireland and employs around 1,500 staff.</p>
      <p>Turnover was worth £176m (€204.5).</p>
