      <p>Someone brought Moore to Sinai Hospital shortly before 8 p.m. Monday with a gunshot wound to her chest, according to multiple reports. She died at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Nine people were shot in Baltimore on Monday and three people died, police said.</p>
      <p>Henderson, a transgender woman, was killed in West Baltimore in 2014. She was found stabbed to death in an alley. A suspect was arrested in that case but was later acquitted. Henderson was the oldest of Bullock’s four siblings, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27970289/new-york-knicks-reggie-bullock-mourns-loss-second-sister-baltimore-violence">ESPN</a>.</p>
