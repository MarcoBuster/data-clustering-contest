      <h1>Trevor Noah asks Hillary Clinton: 'How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T12:48:55+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 12:48</time> by <a rel="author">David Montanaro</a></address>
      <p>"The Daily Show" host Trevor Noah mocked the right-wing conspiracies surrounding the Clintons, jokingly asking <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/the-clintons">Hillary Clinton</a> how she managed to kill <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>"I have to ask you a question that has been plaguing me for a while: How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?” Noah asked in the Comedy Central <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/tnxyum/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-hillary-rodham-clinton---chelsea-clinton---cowriting--the-book-of-gutsy-women----extended-interview?xrs=synd_twitter_110119_tds_3">interview</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The question drew a laugh from Clinton, who was appearing alongside her daughter, Chelsea, to promote their new book. Noah said the former presidential candidate has been a "boogeyman" for the right-wing, questioning why some believe she has so much power.</p>

      <p>“Because you’re not in power but you have all the power. I really need to understand how you do what you do, because you seem to be behind everything nefarious, and yet you do not use it to become president," he said.</p>

      <p>Clinton responded that she's "constantly" surprised at the allegations that are made and the conspiracies about the Clintons are "on steroids" due to social media and the internet.</p>
      <p>"The things they say, and now, of course, it’s on steroids with being online, are so ridiculous, beyond any imagination that I could have. And yet they are so persistent in putting forth these crazy ideas and theories. Honestly, I don’t know what I ever did to get them to upset. ... I've gotten kind of used to it," she said.</p>

      <p>Chelsea Clinton said there is a "constant erosion of truth and sanity" when it comes to political discourse.</p>
      <p>Questions persist about the circumstances surrounding <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/jeffrey-epstein-autopsy-report-released-photos-bone-fracture">Epstein's death</a> after famed pathologist Dr. Michael Baden said this week that the autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.</p>
      <p>“Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,” Baden, who is also a Fox News contributor, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/forensic-pathologist-jeffrey-epstein-homicide-suicide">said on "Fox &amp; Friends"</a> Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The New York City Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday stood by its conclusion that Epstein’s death was caused by suicide by hanging.</p>
