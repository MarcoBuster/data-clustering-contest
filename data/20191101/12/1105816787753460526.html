      <p><b>ANKARA: </b>Midshipmen identifying as adherents of Satanism now have a study group available to them at the US Naval Academy (USNA) at their request, a spokeswoman announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>“The USNA Command Religious Program provides for the exercise of diverse beliefs,” Commander Alana Garas said in a statement, according to US military newspaper Stars and Stripes.</p>
      <p>“Arrangements were being made to provide the Midshipmen with a designated place to assemble as chaplains facilitate for the beliefs of all service members, a responsibility outlined by Navy instructions,” she added.</p>

      <p>The Satanic Temple is an atheist religious organization that is politically active and gained status as a church in May, headquartered in Salem, Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>Under the US Constitution, laws “respecting an establishment of religion” are prohibited, a section widely interpreted to mandate equal treatment for all faiths.</p>
      <p>In addition to Satanists, there are currently 20 religious groups at the Naval Academy, including ones for Muslims, Jews, Protestants, Latter-Day Saints (Mormons), and Buddhists, according to the spokeswoman.</p>
