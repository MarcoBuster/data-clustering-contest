      <p>With the 2019 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rugby-world-cup-final">Rugby World Cup Final</a> taking place on Saturday November 2nd, thousands of breakfast parties are expected to happen around the nation as England face South Africa at 9am.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/morrisons">Morrisons</a> is opening its cafés early to sell St George’s bread rolls that cost only 50p each.</p>

      <p>The 10-inch baps are being sold in store alongside giant packs of the ‘The Best’ pork sausages (£3) and 500g of back bacon (16 rashers) for £2.50.</p>
      <p>But that's not all. The supermarket has also reduced its Big Daddy Breakfast from £6 to a fiver, meaning you can enjoy a massive full English breakfast at a great price before the game kicks off tomorrow.</p>
      <p>You'll even get a free cup of tea with your morning feast if you are wearing the colours of the England flag.</p>
