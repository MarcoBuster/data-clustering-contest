      <p>A bunch of yobs laughed as they blasted a Domino's store with a firework and left a young girl injured.</p>
      <p>Egged on by his pals, a masked thug is seen on video lighting the small explosive and throwing it inside the pizza store before running away.</p>
      <p>A customer is later seen running towards the door in an attempt to escape the blast.</p>
      <p>A 12-year-old girl was left with burns after the explosion last night in Binley, a suburb of Coventry.</p>
      <p>Two Snapchat <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=411087406510911">videos</a> were posted on Spotted Coventry City <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page last night captioned: “Destiny you and your little friends think this is f <b>**</b>  funny.</p>

      <p>“[A] 12-year-old child has burns to her back and hair. How is it funny? What if it were one of your family members I am sure you would not be laughing. Absolute scum. Happened near Princethorpe way, Binley.”</p>
      <p>The first video by Snapchat user 'Destiny' shows several people running away from Domino's before a large blast and a crackle of fireworks. Some onlookers are heard laughing.</p>
      <p>Another video by Snapchat user 'LK's Life' is close-up footage of the thugs who committed the crime.</p>

      <p>Dressed in black and with his hood up and face covered, a man begins to light a firework just outside the Domino's door.</p>
      <p>One delinquent is heard saying: "Light it, light it."</p>
      <p>Another is heard saying: "Oh my god, he's throwing it in there."</p>
      <p>Once the fuse is alight, the yob opens the door and launches the fireworks at staff and customers in the store.</p>
