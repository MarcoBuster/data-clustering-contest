      <p>These will be the first Rage Against The Machine shows since 2011. The band‚Äôs most recent show was at LA Rising 2011, a Los Angeles mini-festival that also included Ms. Lauryn Hill and Rise Against.</p>
      <p>This will actually be Rage Against The Machine‚Äôs third time headlining Coachella. Before their initial breakup in 2000, they headlined the inaugural Coachella in 1999. They also reunited in time to play the festival‚Äôs 2007 edition.</p>
      <p>In the time since then, frontman Zack De La Rocha has reportedly been working on his own music. He‚Äôs shown up on the last two Run The Jewels albums and released the El-P-produced 2016 solo track ‚Äú<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1897822/zack-de-la-rocha-digging-for-windows-prod-el-p/mp3s/">Digging For Windows</a>.‚Äù The other members of the band have formed Prophets Of Rage, a supergroup with Public Enemy‚Äôs Chuck D and Cypress Hill‚Äôs B-Real. They released one album in 2017 and two standalone tracks earlier this year.</p>
