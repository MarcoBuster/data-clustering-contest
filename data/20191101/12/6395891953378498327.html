      <p><b>AMSTERDAMÂ (AP)</b> - A Dutch government agency says the Netherlands is unlikely to reach its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 49% by 2030 despite a tough package of measures.</p>
      <p>The Environmental Assessment Agency said in a report Friday that the government's climate accord , agreed in June, will reduce emissions by 43-48% compared with benchmark 1990 levels.</p>
      <p>But the agency warns that reaching the top of that range will require "maximum effective implementation" of the measures and better-than-expected behavior by key players affected by the changes.</p>
      <p>The agency says developments including expected lower prices for natural gas and higher car sales are pushing the target out of reach.</p>
      <p>The government climate package included a carbon tax and plans to ban coal-fired power stations.</p>
