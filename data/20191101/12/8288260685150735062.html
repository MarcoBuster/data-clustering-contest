      <p>“Oh yes,” said one. “I’ve been wanting a Screwfix closer to home for some time now – this will do nicely.”</p>
      <p>Another added: “Great news, saves me having to go to Brierley Hill.”</p>
      <p>While a third wrote: “Silly place to have it. 7 days a week. You will have to go through the main gate on Saturday and Sunday and be checked in and out by security. But you should be secure as there are loads of security cameras everywhere.”</p>
