      <p>"Whether it comes true or not is not up to me. I don't pick who is captain.</p>
      <p>"But that is something I would love to do one day. Captaining Liverpool is something I have always dreamed of and it is something that motivates me."</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold grew up in the city and entered the club's academy at the age of six. He has no thoughts about playing anywhere else.</p>
      <p>"I've always been a Liverpool player, Liverpool has always been my home," he added. "I have never thought about changing clubs.</p>
      <p>"When I grew up, the dream was always to play for Liverpool. Now I am living the dream and I can't see that changing."</p>
      <p>Liverpool face Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
