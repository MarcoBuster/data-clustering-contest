      <p>Train managers on Virgin West Coast are to stage a 24-hour strike in a dispute over the dismissal of a colleague.</p>
      <p>Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union will walk out on November 19, following weeks of banning overtime.</p>
      <p>RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "I urge all Virgin West Coast members to continue their magnificent solidarity and support for our colleague who has been treated so disgracefully.</p>
      <p>"We cannot allow this appalling situation to continue and our member must be reinstated.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"It is time for the company to stop their aggressive and bullying tactics and sit down with us and right this wrong which has angered staff across the West Coast franchise."</p>
      <p>Virgin West Coast runs straight through Birmingham, with trains to and from Birmingham New Street.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Scottish-based company First Group and Italian firm Trenitalia, which is owned by the Italian government, have formed a new business which will take over services from December 8.</p>
      <p>The franchise involves running inter-city services between Scotland, the North-West of England, North Wales, the Midlands and London, and was awarded by the Department for Transport. That includes services between Birmingham New Street and Euston.</p>
      <p>It means the Virgin Trains brand will disappear after more than 20 years.</p>
