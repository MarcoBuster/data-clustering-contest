      <p>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - North Carolina Republican legislators are closing in on replacing the state’s congressional map with new districts that likely would give Democrats a good chance to collect two more seats.</p>
      <p>The state Senate planned on Friday to debate and vote on proposed district boundaries the state House already approved. The lines are reconfigured so Democrats would be in a favorable position to win seats now held by GOP Reps. George Holding and Mark Walker.</p>
      <p>Republicans are redrawing because judges blocked the current map from being used in the 2020 elections. They said it was likely those lines are illegal partisan gerrymanders.</p>
