        <b>Ghana's Black Stars will leave the country for Sao Tome and Principe on Sunday for the second game of Group C in the 2021 Nations Cup qualifiers. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The team will leave Accra with a chattered flight to the Island country as they continue their journey to AFCON 2021.</p>
      <p>Ghana defeated the Bafana Bafana of South Africa on Thursday to begin the qualifiers on a bright note, after Thomas Partey and debutante Kudus Mohammed had netted in each half to hand all three points to the West Africans.</p>
      <p>Sao Tome and Principe were hammered by Sudan in their opening game 4-0, leaving them rooted at the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>The Black Stars have already began recovery training, and will continue preparations on Saturday at the Madina Zurak Park.</p>
      <p>Paderborn winger Christopher Antwi-Adjei joins the team in training after missing the South Africa clash following late arrival from Germany.</p>
      <p>He is expected to play a role in the game against Sao Tome on Monday.</p>
      <p>Coach Kwesi Appiah has his full squad expect defender Mohammed Salisu, who failed to make the trip to Ghana due to injury.</p>
