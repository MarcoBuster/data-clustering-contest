      <p>Immortals Gaming Club (IGC) announced today that it has sold the <a href="https://outlaws.overwatchleague.com/en-us/">Houston Outlaws</a> of the <i>Overwatch League</i> (OWL) to <a href="https://bbgi.com/">Beasley Broadcast Group</a>, the terrestrial radio broadcaster with 65 stations in large and mid-size markets including Boston, Charlotte, Detroit and Philadelphia. <i>Forbes</i> estimates the deal is worth $35 million. IGC acquired the Outlaws when it <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190612005447/en/Immortals-Gaming-Club-Acquires-Infinite-Esports-Entertainment">purchased</a> all the assets of Infinite Esports &amp; Entertainment this past June for $100 million. Infinite originally paid $20 million in 2018, along with the 11 other founding franchises, to join the OWL.</p>

      <p>Because of its existing ownership of the OWL’s <a href="https://valiant.overwatchleague.com/en-us/">Los Angeles Valiant</a>, IGC was required by league owner <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/">Blizzard Entertainment</a> to divest itself of the Houston franchise. The company told <i>Forbes</i> it had custodial capacity of the team while the league provided oversight and management of the Outlaws' business and competitive operations during the interim period. IGC is worth $210 million per <i>Forbes’</i> latest ranking of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2019/11/05/awful-business-or-the-new-gold-rush-the-most-valuable-companies-in-esports-are-surging/#10f01541324d">most valuable esports companies</a>. The expected sale of the Outlaws was considered in this valuation.</p>
      <p>In July, ESPN first <a href="https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/27290240/real-estate-investor-agrees-buy-houston-outlaws-40-million">reported</a> that Houston-based real estate investor Lee Zieben had agreed in principal to purchase the Outlaws for $40 million, an amount on par with what eight expansion franchises paid to enter the OWL in 2019. That deal was subject to league approval. IGC declined to comment on when and why it fell through.</p>
      <p>Naples, Florida-based Beasley said the Outlaws will remain based in Texas and continue to represent the Houston, Austin and San Antonio markets. (The OWL’s Florida Mayhem, owned by Misfits Gaming, worth $120 million, play out of Orlando and Miami.)</p>
      <p>The radio broadcaster began building its esports platform last October when it <a href="https://bbgi.com/2018/10/02/beasley-media-group-officially-launches-esports-initiative/">acquired</a> the syndicated esports radio talk show <a href="https://checkpointxp.com/"><i>Checkpoint Radio</i></a>, which had previously partnered with Westwood One. This past March, Beasley entered into team ownership, investing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1099160/000119312519139634/d709170d10q.htm">$4.5 million</a> for 43% of the outstanding shares in <a href="https://www.renegadespro.com/pages/about-us">Renegades</a>, a Detroit-based esports team co-owned by former NBA player Jonas Jerebko that is competitive in <i>Fortnite</i> and <i>Rocket League, </i>among others.<i> </i>(The organization 100 Thieves, worth $160 million per <i>Forbes’</i> ranking, recently acquired Renegades’ <i>CS:Go</i> lineup.)<i> </i>The company is set to pay $1.5 million more to increase its <i>Renegades</i> holdings to 57% in the first quarter of next year.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Beasley <a href="https://bbgi.com/2019/11/12/leslie-fitzsimmons-named-executive-director-of-sales-and-marketing-at-beasley-xp-esports-division/">announced</a> it had appointed Leslie Fitzsimmons to a newly created position of executive director of sales and marketing of its esports division, responsible for advertising and sponsorship revenue. Fitzsimmons previously helped launch <i>CheckpointXP On Campus</i>, a weekly video and podcast show housed out of the Hank Greenspun School of Journalism and Media Studies at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. </p>
      <p>The <i>Overwatch League</i>’s third season will begin in February 2020 and will be the first in which each city-based team will host at least two weekends of competition in its home market, with two to four games a day. The Outlaws’ first weekend of matches in Houston will be February 29-March 1, at the city’s downtown 2,000-plus-seat Revention Music Center. The team will keep most of its local revenue, including local sponsorships. The Outlaws finished 16th out of 20 in the OWL this year.</p>
      <p>Beasley is run by Caroline Beasley, who took the helm as CEO in 2016 from her father, George, the founder and chairman. The publicly traded company <a href="https://bbgi.com/2019/11/07/beasley-broadcast-group-reports-record-third-quarter-net-revenue-of-66-1-million/">reported</a> net revenue of $66.1 million for the third quarter of this year—a record for Beasley—and $189.5 million year-to-date, up 4% over last year. The <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bbgi">stock</a> has been trading at a ten-year low this month, closing today at $2.96 per share with a market capitalization of $82.5 million.</p>
