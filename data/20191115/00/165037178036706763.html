        <b>Footballers in Spain's women's league launched an indefinite strike on Friday seeking to double the minimum wage to 16,000 euros ($17,680), the players' union AFE announced.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Association of Women's Football Clubs (ACFF) believes the more modest clubs will be <b>unable to afford wages</b> with the <b>minimum currently set at 8,000 euros.</b></p>
      <p>Women are also trying to <b>force through a maternity package, paid holidays and other basic fringe benefits.</b></p>

      <p>"We will be stopping full match-day programmes as of 16-17 November for an indefinite period, because we have <b>tried all other methods of negotiation,</b>" the players' union said.</p>
      <p>The strike thereby sees the cancellation of this weekend's ninth round of the women's 16-team football league.</p>
      <p>Over the past 15 years women's participation in football in Spain has <b>increased four-fold and there are 70 members of the ACFF.</b></p>
