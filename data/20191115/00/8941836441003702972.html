      <p>BERLIN (AP) - Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi says he’s hopeful the Ebola outbreak in his country will end in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Tshisekedi said Friday a few cases of the deadly contagious disease remain in the eastern province of Ituri but “we think we can end it completely by the end of the year.”</p>
      <p>Over 2,000 people have died in the outbreak which the United Nations declared an international emergency in July. The number of reported infections has since dropped significantly.</p>
