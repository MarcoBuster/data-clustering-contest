      <p>In this article, I’m going to tell you all about the experiences I had during a recent trip to Bali. This trip was so unforgettable that I wanted to share some of its details with you, and most importantly, money-and-time-saving tips, which made everything that much better.</p>
      <p>While I know travel may seem out of reach for many, especially to a luxury resort, let alone far off countries. With a little proper planning and some help from rewards programs and airlines miles, travel can be more affordable than you think. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrae/2019/08/05/five-amazing-ways-to-save-on-luxury-travel/#45967cc31661">There are easy ways to save on luxury travel</a> without feeling like you are staying at a roach-infested roadside motel.</p>
      <p>I had high expectations when I booked my reservation at the Four Seasons Resort Sayan in Bali, Indonesia. Several of my friends, who would not be offended if I called them “hotel snobs,” called it the nicest resort they had ever stayed at. I’m here to tell you that they weren’t wrong. It was peaceful, relaxing, and the service was top notch.</p>
      <p>It’s also an award-winning property. The Four Seasons Sayan was voted the #1 hotel in the world by <i>Travel + Leisure</i> for 2018. How do you like those mangos? By the way, the breakfast fruit bar was stocked daily, with a variety of freshly-squeezed juices, along with mangos, pineapples, and all of the jackfruits you could eat.</p>
      <p>Some of you might be turned off by the lack of a beach at this property. However, I’m willing to bet that all of you beach lovers would find the property and its surroundings to be quite tranquil and zen. It’s the perfect blend of nature, luxurious accommodations, great dining, and spa services. Except for a rafting adventure during the first day, my husband and I never left the property during our stay. More information on that later. Did I mention this 60-suite property is situated on the Ayung River with two pools overlooking the river?</p>

      <p>If you aren’t very adventurous, but celebrity sightings are more your thing, it has been reported that the <a href="https://observer.com/2017/07/obama-vacation-bali-four-seasons-resort/">Obamas stayed in the Royal Villa</a> and also went on the same river rafting adventure. While we didn’t spot any Presidents during our stay, we did see an Olympic Gold Medal Figure Skater who was also staying at the resort.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.financialplannerla.com/financial-independence-level/">For me, have the time and money to travel is the best part of financial independence.</a> Having the resources to stay at resorts like the Four Seasons Sayan, is a whole higher level of financial freedom.</p>

      <p>
        <b>The Rooms Are Amazing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since I am not a former President, we stayed in a one-bedroom villa with a private plunge pool. Our friends were traveling with us, so we had adjoining villas, which added to the ease of being able to relax and enjoy the trip. </p>
      <p>When combining the indoor and outdoor space, each villa is nearly 3,867 square feet, which is larger than my house in Los Angeles. Each comes with a large bathroom, a huge bathtub, and even an outdoor shower.</p>
      <p>Our favorite thing to do each morning was to get up and have coffee on the patio while watching the birds, squirrels, and other creatures begin their days as well. Our room came with a coffee maker, and we put it to good use. You can leave your alarm clock at home; the roosters will be crowing bright and early.</p>
      <p>While I am sure the 20 rooms in the main building are amazing too, do yourself a favor and splurge for one of the 40 villas. It won’t be cheap, but it will be worth every penny.</p>

        <figcaption>Private Rafting is a must if you visit the Four Seasons Sayan<cite>Four Seasons Sayan</cite></figcaption>

        <b>Private Rafting On Bali’s Longest River</b>
      </p>
      <p>You may be thinking, “I’m at the Four Seasons, why would I go river rafting?” To be honest, some members of my party were not that excited to go either, but we all ended up having an amazing time. We even got to swim where Barack Obama and Michelle Obama swam. How cool is that?</p>
      <p>Part of what made the rafting adventure so special was the scenic drive from the Four Seasons Sayan, through rice farming villages, to the departure point for the rafting adventure. Without that, we likely wouldn’t have left the resort during our stay.</p>
      <p>Once on the raft, we enjoyed a two-hour leisurely guided tour through light rapids, with views of the jungle, rice paddies, and even a few gorges. Best of all, our rafting adventure concluded back at the Four Seasons property. The experience concluded with us having lunch and watching other passers-by on their raft tours.</p>
      <p>I knew I would enjoy rafting, but I will admit, I was surprised that it ended up being one of the highlights of our stay.</p>

        <b>The Traditional Balinese Massage</b>
      </p>
      <p>We couldn’t pass up the opportunity to checkout the spa. Like most resorts, The Four Seasons Sayan offered an array of spa experiences. However, what made it unique was the ability to schedule your treatment in the main spa or in one of the private spa villas located throughout the property.</p>
      <p>I wasn’t that adventurous and went with the one-hour traditional Balinese massage. Here is how the massage is described on the resort’s website:</p>
      <p>
        <i>The unique techniques that comprise traditional Balinese massage are passed down through the generations. The massage uses long strokes, gentle skin rolling, deep kneads, and foot reflexology. Choose one of four restorative massage oils: Grounding: ‘Bali Spice’ with clove, ginger, fennel, and vetivert Calming: ‘Peace of Bali’ with sandalwood, ylang-ylang, and ginger Uplifting: ‘Bali Sunrise’ with lemon ylang ylang and bergamot Purifying: Virgin coconut oil.</i>
      </p>
      <p>I’d recommend following up your treatment with some time in the sauna or steam room, or if you prefer, they have jacuzzis with sweeping views of the resort, river, and treetops.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Restorative Hot Stone Yoga</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m a big fan of yoga, which is why I made a point to check out the free, daily Hatha yoga class. It was fine, but what I really enjoyed was the Restorative Hot Stone Yoga. It was a stress-relieving experience that I cannot get at my yoga studio here in Los Angeles. (<a href="http://www.hyperslow.com/">Hyperslow</a>, in case you want to check it out.)</p>
      <p>Here is the description of Hot Stone Yoga from The Four Seasons Sayan website:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Hot stones from the Ayung River are placed on the body as static, fully supported poses are held to further penetrate the muscles and melt away layers of tension. The mind is invited to focus on breathing, invoking a deep meditative state that strengthens the immune, digestive, and reproductive systems. This practice is available with sound therapy upon request, using pure quartz crystal singing bowls.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Yoga classes take place in a remote bamboo yoga bale, in the middle of a rice field, overlooking the Ayung River, which only added to our sense of peace and tranquility. I’m not sure I’ve ever been as calm as I was at the end of my stay.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Romantic Rooftop Dinner</b>
      </p>
      <p>This may not sound that exciting until you see the location. You get to dine above the surrounding jungle, in the middle of the iconic rooftop lotus pond, which is one of the most photogenic sites on the property.</p>
      <p>Unaware of the prix fixe menu, we had to request last-minute changes for a vegetarian in our group. The three-hour experience flew by as we enjoyed the food, wine, and conversation. If you are celebrating something special (we were), this splurge is worth considering.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>How to Stay Book The Four Seasons Sayan:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our stay was booked through the American Express Fine Hotels &amp; Resorts program, which offered some extra amenities. Included were a free room upgrade (based on availability), late checkout at 4 pm, two massages and daily breakfast for two. These benefits were possible given our dates of stay. Five American Express points, per dollar spent, were also given while using the Platinum American Express Card.</p>
      <p>Be sure to check what the rates would be if you were to book directly with the hotel. Amex Fine Hotels &amp; Resorts doesn’t always offer the best pricing or value. If booking directly with the hotel, use your <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrae/2018/11/05/chase-sapphire-reserve/#46d5fe3a6c73">Chase Sapphire Reserve card to get three Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent</a>.</p>
      <p>After our stay, it wasn’t hard to understand why this property was voted <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/worlds-best/hotels-top-100-overall#four-seasons-bali-sayan">#1 World’s Top Hotel</a> by <i>Travel + Leisure</i>. The distinction was earned based on the resort’s unique location, architecture, and experiences that connect guests with the cultural heart of Bali. The publication also highlighted the resort’s “sense of calm” combined with “innovative and modern” new experiences awaiting guests.</p>
      <p>Add this property to your bucket list. Keep in mind; you’ll need to plan ahead; rooms don’t come cheap. What would rather blow your money on, a trip to the mall, or a vacation to Bali? There isn’t a right or wrong answer, but you can guess which choice I made.</p>
