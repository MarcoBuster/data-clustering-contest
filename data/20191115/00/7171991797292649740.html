      <h1>A Self-Expanding PWM Driver</h1>

      <p>For smaller microcontrollers, having enough outputs for the job is sometimes a challenge. A common solution is to do some sort of multiplexing with the available outputs or perhaps something more advanced such as Charlieplexing, but another good option is to use a specialized driver board. What’s even better is if you can <a href="http://www.riderx.info/a-self-expanding-esp32-pwm-board/">daisy chain driver boards to get even more outputs</a>.</p>
      <p>[Eric] has been working on a 16 channel LED project but first wanted to build a driver board with 8 channels. Before building a full 16 channel version he realized that he could take the same 8 channel board, make a mirror image of it, and attach it underneath the first board with headers in order to double the number of channels available. Without having to build a separate 16-channel board, this shortcut saved [Eric] some time and a great deal of effort.</p>
      <p>This is a great example of working smarter, not harder. Each of the 8 or 16 channels has full PWM support as well to support PWM dimming, and a similar board could be built for motor control as well. It’s a good illustration of how good design can end up working for you as well. And if you need even more outputs, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2008/12/03/intro-to-charlieplexing/">Charlieplexing is one way to get them</a>.</p>
