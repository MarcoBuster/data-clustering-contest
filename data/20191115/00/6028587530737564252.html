      <p>Mike Trout now stands among the pantheon of the baseball gods.The center fielder was voted American League MVP Tuesday for the third time in his nine Major League seasons, all with the Los Angeles Angels. Consider the fact he’s only 28.</p>
      <p>Cody Bellinger of the Los Angeles Dodgers won the award in the National League.</p>
      <p>That ties Trout for the most AL MVP trophies along with Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, Jimmie Foxx, Mickey Mantle and Alex Rodriguez. Barry Bonds has the all-time lead with seven, all won in the National League for the San Francisco Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>
      <p>Trout will have a chance to keep adding to that hardware. Just prior to the start of this past season, the Angels gave him a 12-year contract extension worth $426.5 million through the 2030 season.</p>
      <p>He’s also tied with teammate Albert Pujols, whose three MVPs all came in the NL for the St. Louis Cardinals. Trout and Pujols are among 11 in both leagues to win three.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely pretty surreal. Being in the same conversation as Bonds is pretty incredible,” Trout said during a conference call Wednesday night from Iowa where’s on a hunting trip. “Having the same amount of MVPs as Albert is obviously special. You’ve seen what he’s done in his career. Like I said, just being in the same conversation with those all-time greats, it means a lot.”</p>
      <p>Trout earned 17 first place votes and 13 for second place, totaling 355 overall in the balloting process, which includes two members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America in all 15 AL cities. </p>
      <p>Trout finished 20 points ahead of Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman, who had 335 points. He previously won the award in 2014 and 2016 and has also finished in second place four times, and fourth once.</p>
      <p>It’s the second time Trout has been named MVP along with a member of the Dodgers, left-hander Clayton Kershaw having taken home the award in 2016.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty special for California, in general,” Trout said. “A lot of our fans are passionate about their teams. Against the Dodgers, obviously, it’s always a battle when we go up to L.A. and when they come to us. It’s great for both of us bringing the MVP trophy back to L.A. I’m extremely happy for Bellinger. He had an incredible year.”</p>
      <p>It was a very tough season for the Angels and Trout, in particular, who missed the final 13 regular-season games because of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrymbloom/2019/09/15/mike-trout-to-miss-remainder-of-los-angeles-angels-season-after-right-foot-surgery/#17e3c49f7f83">surgery on his right foot</a>. The Angels finished 72-90, and manager Brad Ausmus was fired at the end of the season, replaced by veteran Joe Maddon.</p>
      <p>Trout was plagued by a condition called Morton’s neuroma, which, according to <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/179773.php">Medical News Today</a>, is a “benign, or non-cancerous, growth of nerve tissue that develops in the foot, usually between the third and fourth toes. It is a common and painful condition.”</p>
      <p>The surgery removed the growth and relieved the pain, which feels similar to walking on a pebble in one’s shoe.</p>
      <p>“The surgery went well. The foot is pretty close to 100%,” Trout said. “It was a rough couple of weeks when I first got out of surgery, but I’m pretty much back to normal now and I’ll definitely be ready for spring training.”</p>
      <p>He added that he’d yet to resume any baseball activities.</p>
      <p>“No, when I get back after this trip I’m going to begin some lower body stuff,” he said. “The Angels training staff has got a little program for me to get my strength back in my foot and we’ll go from there.”</p>
      <p>For the third consecutive season the Angels were beset by injuries. Even much worse, they suffered through the July 1 death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs, who was found in his hotel room while the team was preparing for a series against the Texas Rangers in Arlington, Texas.</p>
      <p>An autopsy report released at the end of August revealed Skaggs had pain killers and alcohol in his system when he choked on his own vomit. The club is currently under federal investigation regarding staff involvement in the matter with a Major League Baseball investigation sure to follow.</p>
      <p>Trout himself logged only 134 games and hasn’t played a full season since 2016 when he appeared in 159 games.</p>
      <p>Even so, he had 45 homers, 104 RBIs, scored 110 runs and batted .291. His .438 on-base percentage led the Major Leagues, while his .645 slugging percentage and 1.038 OPS led the AL.</p>
      <p>Despite winning those three MVPs and being named to the AL All-Star team eight times, the Angels with Trout have made the postseason only once – in 2014 when they were swept in a best-of-five AL Division Series by the Kansas City Royals. And that was the only time in the past 10 seasons the Angels have made the playoffs.</p>
      <p>Thus, with the best center fielder in the game hitting high up in their lineup, the Angels have never won a postseason game during his tenure.</p>
      <p>They have played in and won the World Series only once in the 58-year history of the franchise, in 2002 when the Angels came from behind to defeat the San Francisco Giants in seven games.</p>
      <p>But Trout said he doesn’t weigh his personal worth against the performance of the team.</p>
      <p>“I come in every year and I try to be the best,” Trout said. “If at the end of the year I’m in the conversation that means I worked hard, and I had a good year. Obviously, people say you need to make the playoffs, but I’m doing everything I can to try and help the team win.</p>
      <p>“We were banged up with some injuries. We had a death during the season. I let other people decide this. I go out and put up the best numbers I can put up.”</p>
