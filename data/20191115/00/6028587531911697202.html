      <p><b>Varian Medical Systems (NYSE: VAR)</b>, a company that specializes in medical devices for radiation oncology treatments, has seen its stock price rise by 10% over the last month, driven in part by reasonably strong Q4 FY’19 results that were published in late October. (FY ends September) While the company’s revenues grew 9.6% YoY to $878.9 million, beating estimates by about $20 million on the back of strong oncology division revenues, earnings largely met analysts’ estimates. The company’s projections for FY’20 were also reasonably strong, with revenues expected to grow 9% to 12%, with adjusted margins projected to grow from 16.8% in FY’19 to between 17.5% to 18.5%, driven by software sales and an expansion into more high growth, high margin businesses.We ‘step back’ from these recent swings to review performance over the last few years, as a context for what might come next.
