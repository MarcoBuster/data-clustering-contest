        <b>Barca are preparing for the winter transfer market. There are footballer who are hardly playing under Valverde and could leave. According to the French press, Jean-Clair Todibo could be one of them. Bayer Leverkusen want to get him on a loan deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>So far this season, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/j-todibo-506831/">Todibo</a> has played just two matches. <b>He only started one of them</b>. In total, he has played 77 minutes. Very poor figures which make us think in a more than possible departure. </p>
      <p>The central defender could leave the Camp Nou in the winter transfer window. <b>He will certainly not be short of suitors</b>. </p>
      <p>According to 'Le10Sport', <b>a Bundesliga club are interested in him</b>. Bayer Leverkusen are apparently following the player very closely. </p>

      <p>Bayer Leverkusen's proposal is to sign Todibo on loan. <b>They bvelieve the Bundesliga would be a more than interesting option </b>for the defender's growth. </p>
      <p>Todibo needs experience and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barca</a> could opt for that formula. It remains to be seen whether, as this French media outlet points out, <b>Bayer Leverkusen make a formal proposal</b> to the Catalan side to get the Frenchman on loan. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, Todibo is living a dream at Barca. "<b>Three years ago I was in Lilac</b> and now I'm training with Messi, Pique...", the defender said recently. </p>
