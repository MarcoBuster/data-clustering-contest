      <p>A day ethnic based parties operating in Amhara and Oromo regions of Ethiopia sat for a meeting with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed over what seems to be managing security crisis related to ethnic based attack in two regions, state and affiliated media outlets are reporting that seven parties operating in the above mentioned regions have agreed to work together.</p>
      <p>Amhara Democratic Party (ADP), Oromo Democratic Party (ODP), Amhara National Movement (NaMA), Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC),Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), Oromo National Party (ONP) and Amhara Social Vision parties have disclosed their readiness on Friday “to work together,”  as reported by Fana Broadcasting Corporation (FBC). The first two ethnic parties are in the ruling coalition (Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) which means that they run state-machinery in their respective ethnic-based regional states.</p>
      <p>What exactly are the areas where they are working together?</p>
      <p>According to FBC report, ending violence and ethnic-based attacks in the two regions and universities are areas for cooperation. Despite proactive regulatory measure introduced weeks before university students’ return to their respective campuses for registration in the beginning of this academic year, the Federal government proved unable to control ethnic-based attacks which actually created an impression among many Ethiopians that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government is very weak.</p>
      <p>The ethnic-based parties have also agreed to work together on the “unity of Amhara and Oromo people.” In that regard, they have agreed to refrain from “provocative issues” that could strain the relation between the two people and leads to violence.</p>
      <p>Although described as “Tenkuash gudayoch” in Amharic, it is unclear as to what the scope of “provocative issues.”  Ethnic Oromo parties including Oromo Democratic Party claimed in the past an exclusive ownership right over Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. That triggered a reaction from ethnic Amhara parties.  As well, the latter were demanding the federal government to enforce the rule of law in a way to protect the security and safety of citizens and the right to work and live in any part of Ethiopia as stipulated in the Federal constitution.</p>
      <p>From the statement that the seven parties issued on Friday, an agreement is reached that people living in Amhara and Oromo regions of Ethiopia do not have conflicting interests, and the parties have agreed to reverse dangers hovering in both regions.  </p>
      <p>The agreement between the parties is about making peace a priority and to play their part in the effort to bring situations to normalcy- especially in university campuses in the regions.</p>
      <p>News of ethnic nationalist parties in Ethiopia’s two largest regions to work together came as a surprise and welcome news although some pundits seem to be cautious about early celebration.</p>
      <p>The security situation in several universities in Oromo region of Ethiopia caused threats so much so that hundreds of students decided to take refugee, temporarily, in places of worship. At least three students were killed in <a href="https://borkena.com/2019/11/13/ethiopia-students-oromo-region-leaving-university-campuses/">Dembi Dollo University.</a> The latest security situation in the region came after two students were killed at Woldia University last Saturday.</p>
