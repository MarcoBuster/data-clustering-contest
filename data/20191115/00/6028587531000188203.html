      <p>The UFC visits Brazil for the third and final time in 2019 on Saturday for the ESPN+ streaming UFC Fight Night 164 card. In the main event, Jan Blachowicz welcomes Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza to the light heavyweight division. Blachowicz, who is the No. 6 ranked fighter in the 205-pound division, was on a four-fight winning streak heading into his February matchup against Thiago Santos. Santos won that fight via third-round knockout. That victory earned Santos a shot at light heavyweight champion Jon Jones. Jones defeated the surging Santos via split decision. </p>
      <p>Blachowicz bounced back from that setback, his first knockout loss since Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou defeated him by TKO in 2011 under the KSW banner. In July, Blachowicz scored a second-round knockout win over former UFC middleweight champion Luke Rockhold. After that “Performance of the Night” bonus-winning victory, Blachowicz, who is the former KSW light heavyweight champion, asked to be matched up against Jones. Instead, the UFC decided the 36-year-old should fight another former middleweight in his first contest at light heavyweight.</p>
      <p>That fighter is Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza. Souza, who always seemed one fight away from earning a UFC middleweight title shot, went 3-3 in his past six fights at 185 pounds. After a decision loss to Jack Hermansson in April, Souza decided it was time to give the 205-pound division a shot. </p>
      <p>The odds in this matchup favor Blachowicz. </p>
