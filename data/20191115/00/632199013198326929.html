      <p>Licence Bureau is calling on fleet managers to ‘step up’ their road safety focus as part of Brake’s Road Safety Week 2019, which takes place from November 18-24.</p>
      <p>The licence checking company says the week provides an ideal opportunity for businesses to remind employees about the importance of everyone’s contribution to road safety whether they drive a vehicle on company business, ride a bicycle or are a pedestrian walking to work.</p>
      <p>Steve Pinchen, sales director at Licence Bureau, said: “Every 20 minutes, someone is killed or seriously injured on a British road and each of these tragedies is preventable.</p>
      <p>“Road Safety Week provides all road users, especially businesses and business drivers, the opportunity to analyse and review their own current policies and behaviour to ensure they are on the right path to contributing towards safer roads for everyone.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/search?term=licence+bureau">Licence Bureau</a> will take part in Road Safety Week by visiting senior schools in the Hemel Hempstead area, encouraging teachers and 16 to 18-year-olds to focus on road safety.</p>
      <p>This year’s safety message has two key elements: safe journeys, through the use of safety technology and healthy journeys, through the use of alternative transport.</p>
      <p>“Human error continues to be the cause of over 90% of vehicle accidents on the road, yet modern vehicles have a plethora of advanced driver assistance systems to help prevent this," said Pinchen.</p>
      <p>“As part of Road Safety Week, we are encouraging organisations to revisit their policies and procedures whether they are driving, cycling or simply walking.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.awarenessdays.com/awareness-days-calendar/road-safety-week-2019/">Brake’s Road Safety Week</a> is the UK's biggest road safety event and takes place every year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.commercialfleet.org/news/latest-news/2019/05/22/licence-bureau-raises-road-safety-awareness-for-lcv-operators">It aims to inspire schools, employers and communities to take action on road safety,</a> promoting its life-saving messages during the week and beyond.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2019/08/29/licence-bureau-says-complete-phone-ban-enforceable">Licence Bureau recently called for a complete ban on mobile phone usage</a> while driving, saying its ‘long overdue and enforceable’.</p>
