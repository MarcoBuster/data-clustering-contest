      <p><b>Topline:</b> A federal jury on Friday found Roger Stone <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/roger-stone-jury-weighs-evidence-and-a-defense-move-to-make-case-about-mueller/2019/11/15/554fff5a-06ff-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">guilty</a> of lying to Congress and witness tampering in relation to his work on President Trump’s 2016 campaign, which means the longtime Republican operative joins the roster of former Trump associates who ran afoul of the law as a result of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Michael Cohen</b>, Trump’s former personal lawyer, was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/michael-cohen-scheduled-to-be-sentenced-for-crimes-committed-while-working-for-trump/2018/12/11/57226ff2-fcbf-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html">sentenced</a> in December 2018 to three years of prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion, and separately received an additional <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/12/trumps-ex-lawyer-and-fixer-michael-cohen-sentenced-to-3-years.html">two months</a> of prison time for lying to Congress about a Moscow Trump Tower deal.</li>
        <li><b>George Papadopoulos</b>, a former Trump foreign policy advisor, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/us/politics/george-papadopoulos-sentencing-special-counsel-investigation.html">sentenced</a> in September 2018 to 14 days in prison (with a year of supervised release) after pleading guilty to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russian intermediaries during the 2016 campaign; he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/30/george-papadopolous-katie-hill-congress-campaign/">filed in October</a> to run for Katie Hill’s vacant California Congressional seat. </li>
        <li><b>Paul Manafort</b>, Trump’s former campaign manager, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/paul-manafort-trial-verdict.html">found guilty</a> by a Virginia court of tax and bank fraud in August 2018, and in November 2018 voided his plea deal (by lying to investigators) in separate federal charges brought by Mueller; he’s currently serving a combined seven and a half years in prison from both cases. </li>
        <li><b>Rick Gates</b>, a former deputy to Manafort during the Trump campaign, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/former-trump-campaign-official-rick-gates-pleads-guilty-on-two-counts.html">pleaded guilty</a> in February 2018 to charges of conspiracy against the United States and making false statements; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/us/politics/rick-gates-cooperation-sentencing-delay.html">despite</a> a plea bargain, he faces between four to six years in prison, but his sentencing date has yet to happen⁠—partially because he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone-idUSKBN1XM1EK">testified</a> against Stone. </li>
        <li><b>Michael Flynn</b>, Trump’s former national security advisor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html">pleaded guilty</a> in December 2017 to lying to the FBI but nearly two years later has yet to be sentenced; his sentencing has been scheduled for early December, but could be upended by a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/29/claim-by-former-trump-advisor-michael-flynn-in-mueller-case-criticized.html">new claim</a> of innocence filed in federal court.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>What to watch for: </b>Stone’s February 6 sentencing date. He could face a maximum penalty of 50 years in prison, based on his charges. But the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/roger-stone-jury-weighs-evidence-and-a-defense-move-to-make-case-about-mueller/2019/11/15/554fff5a-06ff-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html"><i>Washington Post</i></a> reported that Stone, as a first-time offender, will likely serve less time according to federal sentencing guidelines.</p>
      <p><b>Chief critic:</b> Trump, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/trump-russia-help-elected.html">long claimed</a> the Russia investigation was a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.” He <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/roger-stone-found-guilty-counts/story?id=67015102&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">tweeted</a> shortly after Stone’s sentencing asking if Hillary Clinton and James Comey were liars⁠—along with a list of former and current federal officials he’s also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html">attacked</a>⁠—and suggested a “double standard” was to blame.</p>
      <p><b>Surprising fact:</b> Stone was the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/roger-stone-jury-weighs-evidence-and-a-defense-move-to-make-case-about-mueller/2019/11/15/554fff5a-06ff-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">last person</a> indicted by Mueller as part of the Russia investigation. He was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roger-stone-arrested-video-fbi-raid-trump-associate-house-today-2019-01-25/">arrested</a> in a pre-dawn FBI raid at his Florida home on January 24.</p>
      <p><b>Big number:</b> 34. That’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury">how many people</a> Mueller ended up convicting or indicting.</p>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> Stone worked for Trump’s campaign as an adviser. He officially left the campaign in 2015 but remained a consultant through its conclusion. Stone was accused of working to obtain emails that were hacked by Russia from a Democratic National Committee (DNC) server and released through Wikileaks. According to prosecutors, Stone <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/prosecutor-says-roger-stone-lied-under-oath-because-truth-looked-n1077641">contacted Trump</a> just hours after the DNC said it was hacked by Russia. Stone’s political career began with a stint working for Richard Nixon, and he sports <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/z5Fs9vBTnBuyfHfq7">a tattoo</a> of the late president on his back.</p>
