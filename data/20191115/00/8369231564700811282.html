      <h1>70% of Venice Is Now Submerged, And It's a Disturbing Preview For Coastal Cities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">ALEX HORTON AND ANDREW FREEDMAN, THE WASHINGTON POST</a></address>
      <p>More tidewater roared into Venice on Friday, layering more catastrophic floods into the lagoon city and panicking residents over the viability of living on the lip of the Adriatic Sea.</p>
      <p>Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said the "dramatic situation" was brought on by climate change, in an appeal for additional donations to repair the devastation caused by the worst flooding in half a century.</p>
      <p>While the city may recover on the surface, as it has before, climate scientists have said Venice is a harbinger of the problems facing all coastal cities, as melting ice sheets and warming oceans raise sea levels to unprecedented heights.</p>
      <p>"Venice is the pride of all of Italy," Brugnaro said in a statement, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/41e8c2ce54af44c8826ae1ca9be266cc">reported</a>, as officials said the city was 70 percent submerged. "Venice is everyone's heritage, unique in the world."</p>
      <p>St. Mark's Square, the city's famous piazza, was closed as seagulls swarmed the knee-high water. The flood rose to over six feet in some areas. Italy declared a state of emergency and released 20 million euros to repair the extensive damage.</p>
      <p>The total damage could run into the hundreds of millions, Brugnaro said.</p>
      <p>Because of rising seas, extreme flooding that used to occur in Venice once every 100 years is expected to recur every six years by 2050, according to a <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/home/">recent report</a> by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
      <p>This could become far more common by 2100, recurring every five months. This only takes sea-level rise into account, which will become a progressively greater concern as time goes on.</p>
      <p>The bigger issue: Venice is sinking. That means these flood recurrence periods, calculated for the IPCC report, are on the conservative side.</p>
      <p>Friday's floods are due to another storm in a similar position southwest of Italy, with winds blowing from the southeast to northwest across the Adriatic, piling water toward Venice. Coming atop astronomical high tides and long-term subsidence plus sea-level rise, it's becoming easier to flood the city to severely damaging levels.</p>
      <p>All around the busiest parts of the city, water slicked the floors of cafes and Murano glass shops and seeped into hotel lobbies, leaving a smell of sewage in its wake.</p>
      <p>Venice, over the centuries, has diverted rivers to protect the lagoon and extended the barrier islands. But now, the sea level is rising several millimeters a year.</p>
      <p>Offshore, at the inlets between those barrier islands, a massive project known as MOSE could potentially boost Venice's protection — with floodgates that could be raised from the sea during high tide, sealing off the lagoon.</p>
      <p>The project, launched in 2003, was once forecast to finish in 2011. Then 2014. Now, projections call for completion in 2022.</p>
      <p>Venice has thrived since the fifth century. But even locals with canal water in their blood are taken aback at the flooding and predictions to come.</p>
      <p>"It's a city full of history," said Vladimiro Cavagnis, a fourth-generation Venetian gondolier who chauffeurs tourists on the city's trademark boats.</p>
      <p>"A history that, little by little, with water, will end up like Atlantis. People are destroyed, anguished, sad. They see a city that is disappearing."</p>
