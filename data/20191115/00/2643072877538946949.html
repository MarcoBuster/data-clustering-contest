      <p>The results of candidates who sat for the 2019 <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/waec/"><u><b>West African Senior School Certificate Examination</b> </u></a>in Nigeria has been released by the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/waec/"><u><b>West African Examination Council (WAEC)</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>This was made known by Mr Olu Adenipekun, the Head of National Office, WAEC Nigeria, today at a media conference in Lagos state.</p>
      <p>He said a total of 94, 884 candidates wrote the examination, and added that 33, 304 (representing 35.10%) obtained credits and above in at least five mandatory subjects, including English Language and Mathematics.</p>
      <p>He noted that 35. 64% of the total candidates who sat the same exam last year had a similar result, indicating a slight fall.</p>
      <p>Adenipekun, however, noted that the body withheld the results of 9,457 candidates, for investigation before release.</p>
      <p>According to him, the number of these candidates, representing 9.74 per cent are reported to have been involved in one form of examination malpractice or the other.</p>
      <p>He added that their cases would be presented to the appropriate committee of the council and the decisions reached on the cases would be communicated to the affected candidates within the shortest possible time.</p>
