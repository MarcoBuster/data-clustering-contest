      <p><b>in response to the land art theme, <a href="http://cplusarchitects.net/">C+ architects</a> has developed the museum as an elliptically-shaped ring that houses the major exhibition hall on the second floor.</b> at the first floor, four functional blocks contain the reception, staff office, gift shop and special exhibition area. the blocks on the ground also act to elevate the upper level. therefore, whether visitors look up from the bottom of the slope or from the viewing platform in the distance, the first thing that comes into view is the large oval exhibition space.</p>

      <p><b>the entire art museum appears to ‘float’ in the air, especially when the lights are turned on at night. </b>the architects intend for the exhibition hall to be read as an extension of the landscape and the oval form allows visitors to be surrounded by nature in 360 degrees, resulting in a continuous, direction-free building. the space is separated by functional blocks on the first floor, however, visitors can enter and exit the central courtyard at will, as if they are in the middle of nature, blurring the line between the building and the surrounding mountains.</p>

      <p><b>the oval main exhibition hall uses large glass curtain walls as the façade material, allowing visitors to enjoy the panoramic mountain scenery while admiring the land art works.</b> in foggy weather, they can have the experience of strolling in the clouds and when coming to the central courtyard, people will find that the elliptical ring-shape frames the sky, just like a piece of land art.</p>
