      <h1>Ford PH all set to launch 2020 Transit people carrier</h1>
      <h2>Here's your first look at the PH-spec 2020 Ford Transit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:44:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>The Toyota Hiace and Hyundai Grand Starex will soon have a rival from the Blue Oval. After speculating what could be Ford Group Philippines' latest vehicle, the automaker has officially confirmed that the Transit will be launched in the country soon.</p>
      <p>The company recently sent out an invitation which showed the people carrier in all its glory. Based on the image provided, it looks like Ford will initially launch either the XLT passenger van, or the slightly plushier Transit Custom. While both may look similar, the XLT features a more commercial van-like design. On the other hand, the Transit Custom has slightly more exterior upgrades such as alloy wheels and color-keyed trimmings.</p>
      <p>If it will be the XLT, the Transit can carry up to 15 passengers in total but if it's the Custom, the seat count drops to a still respectable 8. In-car amenities like SYNC 3 infotainemt, cruise control, air-conditioning, Android Auto and Apple CaPlay may be offered as well. A unique rear-view mirror with an integrated reverse camera could also make its way on the PH-spec Transit.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, the 2020 Transit might be powered by a 2.0-liter EcoBlue turbo-diesel engine, much like the Ranger and Everest. Of course, Ford isn't revealing everything just yet by keeping the specs under wraps. But if we were to base it on the Euro and US-spec models, It could make about 130 â€“ 170 PS, and we're sure hoping for the latter. A six-speed automatic or manual transmissions could be available as well.</p>
      <p>Will there be a high roof version of the Transit? Given that the local market has gained an interest in such a vehicle, maybe Ford will also offer a taller version of the people carrier soon.</p>
      <p>Estimated pricing of the upcoming Ford Transit could supposedly start at around Php 2.5 million.</p>
