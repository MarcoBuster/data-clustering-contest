      <p>Realme has now started rolling out ColorOS 6.1 for the Realme X2 in Europe. The latest update, version RMX1993EX_11.A.15, brings the system-wide dark mode that the company previously released in a number of its devices. Along with that, the update also adds nightscape mode for the front camera, allowing users to take selfies in dimly lit environments.

      <p>It’s worth noting that Realme has maintained a decent update schedule for its devices over the last couple of weeks. The company has previously released updates for the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-3-pro-realme-x-get-updates-dark-mode-october-2019-security-patches/">Realme 3 Pro and the Realme X</a>, featuring the new dark mode and Android security patches. It has also released updates for the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-5-updated-dark-mode-wide-angle-video-realme-2-pro-dark-mode-november-security-patches-more/">Realme 5 and Realme 2 Pro</a>, packing in almost all the same features. Most recently, it released <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-xt-update-november-patches-nightscape-front-camera/">updates for the Realme XT</a> and the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-3-3i-update-brings-november-2019-security-patches-dark-mode-digital-wellbeing-more/">Realme 3/3i</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with the updates, Realme has also released kernel sources for a couple of its devices. Last month, it released the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-xt-5-5-pro-kernel-source-code-available/">kernel sources for the Realme XT, 5 and 5 Pro</a>. And now, with the latest update, the company has also released the kernel sources for the Realme X2, even though the device was just <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-x2-xt-snapdragon-730g-30w-december/">launched last month</a>. The timely kernel source release will kickstart third-party development for the Realme X2 and we expect to see new custom ROMs and kernels for the device in the coming weeks.</p>
