      <p>The position of COO is often misunderstood. The more you examine the nature of the position, the clearer it becomes that there are very few constants from one COO to the next. Individuals from all different backgrounds are successful in the role.This variability is exactly what makes the job so difficult to study from an objective point of view. How can you know if you are making proper inferences when comparing COOs when there is not even an agreed-upon description of what the role entails?</p>
      <p>I cannot speak for every COO. But I can relay the experiences I have had in my first two years as COO of a company.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A Role In Decline?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The COO typically takes on responsibility for every area of operations, including marketing, production, sales, development and research. The question is, how can a title that accommodates such diversity retain such meaning?</p>
      <p>The key is the orientation of the role.</p>
      <p>While most jobs are defined primarily in relation to the work done and the structure of the organization, the role of the COO is defined instead in relation to an individual. The individual in question? The CEO.</p>
      <p>Being a COO entails a shift in perspective. You have to have a deep understanding of how your CEO works, thinks, acts. There has to be absolute trust in one another.</p>
      <p>It can be surprising to learn, then, that the COO role is declining in popularity. In 2014, only 36% of Fortune 500 companies had a COO, a decline of 12% since 2000. However, I do not believe the role is doomed to extinction, for two primary reasons: As companies become ever more complex and massive, it becomes more difficult for one person to oversee the entire organization. Also, an increase in talent mobility means the role will likely become more commonplace as a <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/05/second-in-command-the-misunderstood-role-of-the-chief-operating-officer">retention mechanism</a> for key executives who are at risk of moving to a competitor.</p>
      <p>Since I accepted my COO role, the learning curve has been steep. It has been abundantly clear how much I still have to learn, but the toughest lessons are always the most worthwhile.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Stay Positive</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being a matchmaker is a pretty unusual job. You take it for granted after a while, but sometimes I stop to think about what I'm really doing: helping people find true happiness.</p>
      <p>The move to COO only increased the pressure to deliver results time and again in accordance with the high standards expected by our clientele. I must utilize every facet of my interpersonal skills, relationship expertise and, most importantly, optimistic demeanor in order to do my job to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>It can be tough, but a sunny disposition is ultimately priceless and, in my experience, invaluable for a COO. No matter the size of the obstacle, I always try to look at it from a different angle without jumping to conclusions. Do the right thing, keep calm in emotionally volatile situations and try to always see the best in your employees and your clients alike.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Delegate, Delegate, Delegate</b>
      </p>
      <p>The industry of love is growing at an exponential rate. The capacity to delegate tasks to members of my team means morale and dedication among our matchmakers must be boundless. There is always a solution to be found if you look hard enough and put your mind to it. Don't stress. Utilize the individual skill sets of every employee in order to reach that end goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Time Management And Stress Relief Are Everything</b>
      </p>
      <p>As well as being COO, I am also head matchmaker in our Manhattan office. I need a solid routine in order to be my best and perform optimally. I check in with clients and potential matches alike via video calls or meetings, touch base with our matchmakers on a daily basis to give and receive feedback on dates and, in between all of this, find it integral to take time for yoga, meditation and self-development. As my grandmother would say, "Dance it out." (I find random spurts of dance movements to be incredibly effective stress busters in between meetings, much to the bewilderment of some of the ladies in the office.<b>)</b> I adore my high-pressure role, but outlets for assuaging the effects of stress are paramount to success.</p>
      <p>Being a COO is unpredictable. The role can be highly challenging — volatile, even. It presents you with unusual conundrums on a daily basis. You need to be thick-skinned, savvy and hugely adaptable, but the difference that a capable COO can make to their company is almost immeasurable in the long run.</p>
      <p>Despite the role becoming less common, you'd be advised to think twice before permanently resigning that vacancy in your C-suite. Creating a COO role within your business will relieve pressure on the CEO in ways you may not foresee right now. What's more, by officially instating a highly trusted member of the team in a position of authority, you cultivate a positive working environment and an overarching ethos of respect from the bottom up. You can't put a price on that.</p>
