      <p>(Nov 15): Asian stocks saw a muted start to trading Friday as traders awaited further updates on a partial U.S.-China trade deal. Treasuries pared overnight gains.</p>
      <p>Stocks ticked higher in Japan and Australia and dipped in South Korea. Earlier, the S&amp;P 500 eked out its third gain in a row, but continued to trade under records reached over the last week with technology stocks underperforming. U.S. economic data gave traders few reasons to change bets, with the focus now on Friday’s retail sales figures. The yen gave up some of Thursday’s gains.</p>

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow was reported saying the U.S. is “getting close’ to a deal. Meanwhile gloomy figures out of Asia are serving as a reminder of the impact the ongoing trade tensions are having on the global economy, and traders continue to eye the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong.</p>
