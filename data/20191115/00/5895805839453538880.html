      <p>It's no secret that there are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a> disparities in pay, professional opportunities, fields of study, household labor, and more. Men <a href="https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap">tend to earn more</a> than women; men <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2186">tend to advance to higher ranks in their professions</a> than women; and men <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/05/breadwinning-wives-gender-inequality/589237/">tend to do less housework</a> than women. But why?</p>

      <p>One contention, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9973.1979.tb00062.x">long argued for</a> by various feminist philosophers, is that part of the explanation is that the notions of rationality and reason are associated with men, while the notions of feeling and emotion are associated with women. Thus, men are more readily accepted in professions and fields of study taken to require logic, reasoning, and brilliance; women are more readily accepted in professions and fields of study taken to require warmth, emotional sensitivity, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intuition">intuition</a>. The disparities follow, because disciplines in the first, stereotypically-male category are normally afforded higher pay, greater esteem, and occur outside of the home.</p>
      <p>Of course, this contention has not been universally accepted. But a recently published set of studies seeks to put this philosophical hypothesis to the test using the tools of cognitive psychology.</p>
      <p>The results suggest, as the title of <a href="https://www.collabra.org/article/10.1525/collabra.274/">the paper</a> puts it, that the concept of rationality <i>is</i> gendered.</p>
      <p>Here is how the authors characterize the three studies they report:</p>
      <blockquote>To summarize our empirical program of research, Study 1a uses the Implicit Association Test (IAT: Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998) as well as explicit measures to test the hypothesis that participants preferentially associate male with thinking and female with feeling. Study 1b uses a modified IAT procedure to decompose that relative inquiry into independent associations between male and thinking more than feeling between female and feeling more than thinking. Study 2 provides a conceptual replication again using explicit measures as well as an alternative implicit measure, a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/priming">priming</a> procedure, to investigate whether the rapid presentation of photographs of men (women) make concepts related to thinking (feeling) more accessible, influencing ostensibly unrelated semantic judgments. Finally, Study 3 explores the consequences of these gendered associations through a pre-registered investigation of whether these explicit or implicit associations relate to men and womenâ€™s interest in and estimates of the relative prevalence of men and women in several academic disciplines. Taken together, these results provide evidence that rationality is semantically gendered at the level of basic conceptual associations, and that these associations could be consequential for individual interest in and perceptions of various professional disciplines.</blockquote>
      <p>The authors note some interesting nuances and limitations of their results. For example, they found that women exhibited some implicit-explicit ambivalence, "rejecting strong notions of gendered rationality in their self-reports but nonetheless showing robust evidence of <i>male-reason</i> and <i>female-emotion</i> associations at the implicit level." They also note that men's explicit gender stereotypes appear to be stronger. This finding is important, they claim, because one who explicitly endorses a stereotype may be less likely to want to mitigate its effects on real-world decisions. The "may" here is important, as they claim, further, that one reason their findings are not undermined by <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-death-and-the-self/201803/in-defense-implicit-bias">recent critiques of the implicit bias literature</a> is because they were mainly out to "document the widespread presence of a subtle but widely held form of cultural stereotype linking rationality to gender, independent of its role in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/decision-making">decision making</a> or its locus within the individual versus the culture." It would be interesting to investigate, in future work, potential links between the associations found in these studies and real-world decision making.</p>
      <p>Another fruitful avenue for further inquiry in this area would be to investigate the question of causation. The authors note that their results "complement recent work by past researchers interested in how gender stereotypes relate to occupational stereotypes as well as occupational choices" but do not allow us to determine whether the association of men with reason contributes by "buttressing" or "underlying" gender disparities in relevant fields. Anyone interested in mitigating and combating these gender disparities should be interested to find out which it is.</p>
      <p>In sum, these findings show the fruits of putting philosophical hypotheses to the empirical test, and they provide some empirical support for the longstanding contention that our conception of rationality encodes gendered assumptions. I, for one, look forward to seeing where this work leads.</p>

      <p>The workplace death gap: men account for 93% of industrial accident fatalities. Sometimes, but not always, jobs that have increased risk of death and permanent injury pay more.</p>
      <p>The healthcare funding gap: in the USA, there is the Office of Women's Health, but nothing comparable for male health. As one result among many.. breast cancer gets many times more public and private funding that prostate cancer gets.</p>
      <p>The suicide gap: there are about 4 male suicides for every female suicide.</p>
      <p>The life expectancy gap: the average male life expectancy is about 6 years less than the average female life expectancy. And, the male life expectancy has now fallen for the last 3 consecutive years.</p>

      <p>....because it doesn't factor in years of experience, level of education, and hours worked. The "hours worked" part is key: men are far more likely to work late into the night and on weekends than woman are, which explains why they get more promotions.</p>
      <p>But here is the reality check: if there really was a pay gap, cost-minded businesses would simply fire all the men, and replace them with women, to save money.</p>

      <p>Lots of the statistics used to expose a pay gap look at annual incomes provided by the Social Security information. These stats don't look at number of hours worked. Some men work in emergency fields that include call-outs. Lots of these workers get more income from off-shift work than then their normal shift. A guy that works for the power company that gets called-out when there are outages is making serious bank. Add to that voluntary overtime in many different blue collar jobs. Men are more likely to be offered and accept overtime opportunities. If you remove overtime pay from the equation the gap is much smaller.</p>

      <p>A man that works for the power company is doing dangerous work. If he is working overtime, the greater the chance that he will be tired, and could make a fatal mistake.</p>
      <p>Women tend to work in air-conditioned offices do not have the danger factor, and are generally not required to work overtime.</p>
      <p>The discomfort factor of BEING REQUIRED to get up in the middle of the night, and do dangerous work, command higher pay.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Kent Drake on November 16, 2019 - 4:16am</p>
      <p>Corporate structures are designed with lots of dead end jobs at the bottom of the hierarchy. Lets forget about the sex of the worker for a minute. All companies need worker-bees to get the work done. Both men and women work in these positions. There's nothing wrong with that. Many of those people are content to do their job and get their paycheck. The better they get at doing their job, the more their job security increases. This applies the same way in government jobs. Some people value job security more than making more money.</p>
      <p>Some workers get restless in a dead end jobs. They reevaluate their situation and consider other options. Sometimes the best option is to quit and seek another position with a different company. Some workers focus on trying to advance with their current employer.</p>
      <p>Men feel social pressure to be successful. Friends and family are asking them about their career. They may be content with their current position, but they feel compelled to take some action to avoid looking like a loser. Seeking a new position within their company or looking for a different job that pays more becomes a quest to address the social pressure. Women are less likely to feel they same pressure from friends or family. It's more likely that they will be expected to marry a guy that is successful. No one will question them if they have a solid entry level position.</p>

      <p>Submitted by Anonymous on November 16, 2019 - 5:51am</p>
      <p>Occasionally, I check the comment section of articles on gender bias and/or misogyny. No matter how many qualified professionals talk about the widely accepted notion that women are disadvantaged, the Lucifers, Franks, Dr O'Brians and Kent Drakes show up with the usual Jordan Peterson-like arguments. It makes me wonder so many things. Is it one person or a few? Does he/they think that it's possible to convince everyone that men are the true victims by diligently commenting on every gender-related article on the Psychology Today website? Does this person/people spend all his free time doing this? Has anyone actually been influenced? Why is this person/people torturing himself by reading article after article (and all the comments) on a topic that so clearly upsets him? Why do none of the articles change his rigid mind? Fascinating.</p>
