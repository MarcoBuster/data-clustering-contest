      <h1>City present a formal complaint about the refereeing against Liverpool!</h1>

        <b>'The Sun' confirm that Manchester City sent a letter to Mike Riley, director of refereeing in the FA, asking for explanations as to what happened in the Liverpool-Manchester City game at Anfield.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/liverpool/"> Liverpool</a>-<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> game was a match that went down in <b>history in the Premier League</b>. Not so much because of the 'Reds' win, which takes City away from a title, which they will have to come back for in a spectacular way.</p>
      <p>But more for what happened during the game. In the match, <b>Pep Guardiola left iconic images when he protested</b> what he considered to be three penalties not awarded to his team.</p>
      <p>'The Sun' informs that <b>Manchester City supported their coach and sent a formal complaint to Mike Riley</b>, director of refereeing in the FA, to ask for an explanation.</p>

      <p>At the same time, Pep Guardiola also criticised the way in which VAR was being implemented at a UEFA coaches' meeting in Nyon.</p>
      <p><b>Riley tried to respond constructively</b> to the team's letter, but stressed his decision to <b>not change the VAR policy in England.</b></p>
      <p>To summarise, Riley will have a meeting with the clubs, but it will be to analyse the benefits of the use of VAR and, despite a lot of mistrust, there will be no withdrawal of VAR in England until the processes are improved.</p>
