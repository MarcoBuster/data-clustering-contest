      <h1>US soybean crush hits record October volume, meal exports spike</h1>

      <p>The volume of soybeans crushed in the domestic soy complex in the US rose last month to hit the highest October level ever in for the month despite a sluggish harvest.</p>
      <p>US crushers put 175.4 million bushels through their facilities last month, up by close to 9 million bushels on trades estimates and up 3.1 million bushels on the October 2018 figure, data from the National Oil Processors Association (NOPA) showed.</p>
      <p>Soyoil stocks fell to 1.42 billion lbs from 1.44 billion lbs in September, in line with analyst expectations.</p>
      <p>“These oil stocks are low relative to the high volume crushed, but meal exports were good,” said Terry Reilly, an analyst at Futures International.</p>
      <p>Soymeal exports in the month hit 894,817 tons, up from 844,584 tons in September, although they were down from the 967,174 tons exported in October last year.</p>
      <p>Crushers faced less competition from exporters as China sought out its soybean demand from South American origins for most of the month, allowing for greater domestic availability of beans despite a slow harvest.</p>
      <p>China only began to buy from the US in the final week of the month, when the government allocated tariff-free quotas on US beans to private and state-backed crushers rumoured to total 10 million mt.</p>
      <p>And the rise in the crush volume came as board crush values rallied higher, hitting 93 c/bu by October 31, up from 67 c/bu on September 30 according to Agricensus data.</p>
      <p>Soybean meal futures rose by 1% from their close on Thursday amid news of higher October exports, but December soyoil futures had dropped by 25 c/lb by 1730 London time amid a wave of profit-taking.</p>
      <p>The NOPA report precedes the full USDA report, which is due on December 1, although the market uses the figures as a guide to demand.</p>
