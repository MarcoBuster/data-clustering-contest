      <h1>Predictions Friday – Fasten Your Seatbelts for a Wide Open Race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.awardsdaily.com/author/admin/" target="_blank">Sasha Stone</a></address>
      <p>There are various versions of this year’s Oscar race. There are a lot of angles being covered and no clear consensus, at least as far as I can tell, among the pundits. That’s because there are so many unanswered questions, so many factors putting pressure on how this race will go.</p>
      <p>Social media has made it much worse because once you take a stand, you sort of have to defend your stand. Tribes begin to form around certain films. Bad intel rides the rails and get passed on from person to person. These aren’t even whisper campaigns by now because these can be said OUT LOUD by people who are publicists, or assistants to publicists cloaked in anonymity and aliases, spreading perceptions and opinions and outrages on Twitter. It isn’t hard to start something. Heck, how do you think Trump got elected?</p>
      <p>But most of the Academy is, thankfully, not plugged into Twitter. The voters might hear things through the grapevine but the Twitter angle is to influence people who cover the race and then perhaps that trickles down eventually to the Academy. The problem now is that there are too many complaints swirling around, too many conflicting ideas, so it’s created chaos as far as the race goes. We also don’t have a lack of <i>real intel</i> right now, regarding what films the industry voters are thinking — not the critics, not the bloggers, not even the festival goers but the thousands of people in the industry who vote on the Producers Guild, Directors Guild and SAG/AFTRA.</p>
      <p><b>Theory number one:</b> It’s The Irishman’s to beat. A film like this doesn’t come along very often and Scorsese is an American treasure. An actor-driven, mesmerizing epic about one glance back on a conflicted life of crime, conscience, and family.</p>
      <p><b>Theory number two:</b> No other film can win besides Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Tarantino’s amazing career has yet to be awarded with a Best Director or Best Picture prize. The crowd-pleasing nostalgic ode to the city and industry that made Tarantino — L.A. on the cusp of its last great heyday, achingly familiar to the majority of Academy members. It’s Tarantino’s third chapter of his vividly realized revenge trilogy that targets the demons that haunt us — Nazism, slavery and the Manson murders.</p>
      <p><b>Theory number three:</b> No other film can beat Jojo Rabbit. While it might be inspiring a sharply mixed reaction, it’s not a question of how good or not good the film may be but rather some qualms about whether enough people can get past the high satire to be emotionally moved by the story. Does any other film come with such a hit of pure joy as this one? Let’s laugh, let’s dance, and let’s wrest our power back from the brink of a world on fire.</p>
      <p><b>Theory number fou</b>r: It’s none of these but rather a stealthy, under-the-radar movie that nobody is looking at but everyone likes and many love and no one hates. That film is James Mangold’s Ford v Ferrari. The movie that wins isn’t <i>always</i> one with a hard-hitting message. Sometimes just plain good movies win. Has there been a film this year more satisfying than this one? It is a celebration of what the American film industry does best, and serves to justify why we still need movies to be made for adult people, and seen on the biggest screen possible  — real stories, real people, real feels.</p>
      <p><b>Theory number five</b>: It’s <i>still</i> none of these. It’s the war movie no one has seen. It’s going to take the season with the kind of shock and awe that only a balls-out war epic can.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to sit with uncertainty. It’s hard to have so many people covering a race that no one knows anything about. We’re all sort of flailing around with theories.</p>
      <p><b>Here’s the truth:</b> we won’t know until we know because no frontrunner has yet pulled ahead, and one of the reasons is that some of these films haven’t yet opened to the public. So we know about the very controlled reactions in screenings — but not what people “out there in the world” think and what people “out there in the world” think is a better guide than the insular one where pundits dwell, at least in terms of finding winners.</p>
      <p><b>Films I think are being underestimated:</b><br/>Ford v Ferrari<br/>Dolemite Is My Name<br/>Harriet</p>
      <p>My only advice is this: try to keep an open mind.</p>
      <p>But let’s just do it anyway – I’ll take a blind guess on how I think things <i>might</i> go.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Best Picture</b>
      </p>
      <p>My idea of solid Best Picture nominees — defined as films that will likely get 200-300 number one votes. Remember, divisiveness doesn’t come into play with nominations for Best Picture; just when it comes to winning.</p>
      <p>
        <b>These are those I feel most confident about — as in, there will be a lot of people who pick these films as their number one:</b>
