      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) - Cleveland police say they are not investigating Browns player <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Myles Garrett</a> for striking a Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback in the head with a helmet.</p>
      <p>Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia (CHAWCH’) said Friday that police hadn’t received a complaint from Mason Rudolph.</p>
      <p>And a city spokeswoman says the prosecutor can’t comment because Rudolph hasn’t filed a complaint.</p>
