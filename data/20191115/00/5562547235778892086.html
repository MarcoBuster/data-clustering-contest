      <h1>Giannis Antetokounmpo Wishes Malcolm Brogdon ‘Was Still Here’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/giannis-antetokounmpo">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> wishes former Bucks teammate <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/malcolm-brogdon">Malcolm Brogdon</a> was “still here.”</p>
      <p>Instead, Milwaukee’s front-office allowed Brogdon to ink a four-year, $85 million deal with the Indiana Pacers as a restricted free agent last summer.</p>

      <p>The Greek Freak says the 26-year-old ultimately made a decision that was “best for him.”</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://theathletic.com/1380755/2019/11/15/wish-he-was-still-here-giannis-antetokounmpo-speaks-up-about-former-teammate-malcolm-brogdon">The Athletic</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Definitely wish he was still here,” Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “One of my friends, one of the guys that I always teased every day when I see him – call him ugly, we’re just going back and forth. I’m going to miss that, but at the end of the day, you got to do what’s best for you. I wish him the best, I wish his team the best and I’m excited to play against him.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>This season for the Pacers, he is averaging 20.7 points, 8.5 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Can you imagine this team with also Malcolm?” Antetokounmpo said after the Bucks’ 124-115 victory over the Bulls on Thursday night. “But hey, man, everybody takes their decision. His decision was to go to Indiana and build a team over there. I think that was best for him.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>So has the team’s stance on entering the luxury tax change? Why make a move that appears to weaken your roster?<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I think our stance is pretty similar,” Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry said during the owners’ press conference before the season. “I don’t think we have an issue paying the luxury tax. I think part of it is we know we’re going to be in it. We’re definitely going to be there in a couple of years, soon. That’s not the question. The question is, Was re-signing Malcolm an imperative? I think re-signing Malcolm was a luxury and our view was Malcolm is a phenomenal player. He’s great, but for that amount of money, we thought we could have those dollars better spent elsewhere. And we’ll find out.”</i>
