      <p>Ever since the City edition uniforms were introduced when Nike became the uniform supplier for the NBA, the Orlando Magic have easily had some of the more stranger and “out there” uniforms under that banner. Their space-inspired City uniform from the 2017-18 season will likely go down as one of the wildest experiments in NBA uniform history – so much so that it made the 2018-19 offering look tame by comparison.</p>

      <p>If you were expecting <a href="https://www.nba.com/magic/jerseys">the 2019-20 edition</a> to continue in a similar vein to the previous two City uniforms for the Orlando Magic, you’re either going to be relieved or disappointed by Orlando’s latest offering for this season. Either way, you’re going to have an opinion because this will surely be a polarizing uniform. Instead of playing up their “magical” visual identity, Orlando has decided to turn to another local icon for uniform inspiration – oranges.</p>
      <p>Just as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/demetriusbell/2019/11/01/atlanta-hawks-let-black-jerseys-dominate-peach-aesthetic-with-2019-20-city-uniforms/">the Atlanta Hawks went with a local fruit offering</a> as the cornerstone of their new City edition uniform, the Central Florida NBA representatives are going with their local fruit of choice. They’re also following in their Southeast Division rivals’ footsteps by letting a dark color dominate what would ideally be something bright and vibrant. Orange County’s NBA team pays tribute to the state’s iconic fruit by wear what appears to be a dark gray (or maybe charcoal) uniform with only traces of orange on the numbers, lettering, striping and smaller elements in the uniform.</p>
      <p>From a standpoint of at least sticking with something close to their normal colors, sticking with the dark color makes sense for the Magic. You’re used to seeing them with black in their uniform scheme and visual identity, so it only makes sense that they would stick with a dark color being their base color for this particular uniform. With that being said, if you’re going to go ahead and add a vibrant color such as orange into your color scheme in an effort to pay tribute to your local tradition then maybe it would have been better if orange was the primary color of the entire jersey.</p>
      <p>It may have come off looking a little too reminiscent of the Phoenix Suns but it would have at least been a bit more fun and definitely more appealing to the eye than simply going with the color choice that the Magic went with. Just like the Hawks may have missed out on an opportunity to have a truly unique uniform with their Peachtree tribute uniform, the Magic appear to have missed an opportunity to bring orange to the forefront by letting a much darker color dominate the uniform instead.</p>
      <p>On an interesting note, <a href="https://www.nba.com/magic/city-edition-uniform-inspired-city-orlando-and-its-orange-roots-20191114">this article from the NBA’s website</a> mentioned that this uniform was actually in the works for two years. It’s intriguing to think about the designs that were left on the floor and won’t see the light of day. This is a great idea on paper and while the hard work shows in the overall clean and crisp design of the uniform, a color refresh would do wonders for this uniform. Maybe the Magic will return to the drawing board and release something that actually embraces the citrus flavor of oranges instead of just taking a small nibble of the orange.</p>
