      <h1>EPL: Henry Speaks On Arsenal Finishing Fourth On The Table</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal player, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/thierry-henry-becomes-montreal-impacts-head-coach9/"><u><b>Thierry Henry</b></u></a>, is hopeful that the North London side will finish in the English Premier League top four this season.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are currently in the sixth position on the Premier League table and eight points behind Manchester City currently in fourth place.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery’s men lost to Leicester City last weekend, but the club legendary player believes Arsenal can secure a spot in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The new head coach of MLS side, Montreal Impact, while speaking with Yahoo Sport said, <i>“For me, as a fan, I would like us to get back into the top four and get Champions League football back at the Emirates.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Right now, it looks like not just us who are struggling but also United and Tottenham are struggling, so you have to hope we can go on a run.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“What do they need to change? I’m not in the dressing room every day to know what is happening in training. That’s the job of Emery or whoever is in charge.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“As a fan, I would like to see them back in the Champions League, that will be a start because catching Liverpool at the minute seems very complicated. Even for Manchester City. Let’s see where we can finish at the end of the season.”</i>
