      <p>Sensex closed higher by 70.21 points, 0.17 percent, at 40,356 while Nifty settled at 11,895, up 23 points, 0.20 percent</p>

      <p>The telecom counter buzzed with activity, followed by banks and PSU stocks while FMCG, IT and oil &amp; gas stocks saw some profit-taking.</p>
      <p>Experts feel that progress on the US-China trade deal did improve sentiment but muted macros weighed on the sentiment which triggered profit-taking as Nifty50 inched closer towards 12,000 levels.</p>
      <p>The index closed above its crucial 5-days EMA which is a positive sign, but for the week closed flat with a negative bias.</p>
      <p>"Signals on further progress on US-China trade deal improved sentiment across global markets but weakening macros and a muted end to Q2 results induced investors to book profits at higher levels. Government plans to set a minimum price for mobile calls and data to revive the telecom sector, boosted telecom stocks. Further, PSU banks gained some ground on account of likelihood reduction in NPAs post the favourable verdict from the Supreme Court. Given declining macros, the market expects concrete steps from government and RBI to push growth going ahead," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd.</p>

        <b>Technical View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nifty50 registered a Bearish reversal formation called Gravestone Doji in which open, close and low of a candle are equal or similar</p>
      <p>Friday’s intraday sell-off with long upper shadow, from the highs of 11973, is clearly suggesting lack of conviction on the part of bulls at higher levels.</p>
      <p>If Nifty slips below 11891 levels on Monday then it should head towards 11802, 11700 levels</p>
      <p>Traders are advised to remain neutral on the long side whereas intraday traders can create fresh shorts below 11891 and look for a target of 11800, suggest experts.</p>
      <p>Three levels: 11879, 11973, 12034</p>
      <p>Max Call OI: 12000, 11800</p>
      <p>Max Put OI: 11600, 11500<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
