        <b>ICICI Direct's research report on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/refineries/mahanagargas/MG02">Mahanagar Gas</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Mahanagar Gas (MGL) reported a mixed set of Q2FY20 numbers. While volumes for the company were below our estimates, operational profit was above estimates on account of better-than-expected gross margins. The topline increased 12.9% YoY to Rs 861.6 crore, marginally above our estimate of Rs 851.4 crore. Volumes came in at 3.0 mmscmd (up 1.3% YoY) vs. our estimate of Rs 3.1 mmscmd mainly on account of lower growth of 1% YoY in CNG volumes. Gross margins increased by Rs 2.2/scm YoY to Rs 14.7/scm (our estimates: Rs 13.8/scm) due to higher-than-expected realisation. On the profitability front, PAT increased 98.5% YoY to Rs 270.6 crore and came in above our estimate of Rs 175.5 crore on account of tax reversal of Rs 14.8 crore after implementation of lower tax rate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>Due to the recent run-up in stock prices and also on uncertainty over the regulator’s (PNGRB) decision on possible competition in existing area (Mumbai), we arrive at a target price of Rs 1080 with a HOLD recommendation.</p>
