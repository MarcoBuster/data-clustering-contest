      <h1>DSP Spreadsheet: IQ Diagrams</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/wd5gnr1/" target="_blank">Al Williams</a></address>
      <p>In previous installments of DSP Spreadsheet, we’ve looked at generating signals, mixing them, and filtering them. If you start trying to work with DSP, though, you’ll find a topic that always rears its head: IQ signals. It turns out, these aren’t as hard as they appear at first and, as usual, we’ll tackle them in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r3wyZfLLbBT67eD3yslR7dTSdLF-yN6AAF18R8RSqOs/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
      <p>What does IQ stand for? The I stands for “in phase” and the Q stands for quadrature. By convention, the I signal is a cosine wave and the Q signal is a sine wave. Another way to say that is that the I and Q signals are 90 degrees out of phase. By manipulating the amplitude of I and Q, you can create complex modulation or, conversely, demodulate signals. We’ll see a spreadsheet that shows that completely next time.</p>
      <p>For now, though, consider a sine wave of frequency f that has relative phase Φ. That is just a fancy way to say that if you pick one point to be the “zero” point of a reference sine wave (even if it doesn’t really exist) the wave in question will be shifted over from that point. We saw in the last installment that a sine wave and a cosine wave are the same except for phase and you can model them like this: <code>y=A*cos(2πft+Φ)</code>. If the phase angle (Φ) is -90 degrees, you have a sine wave.</p>
      <h3>Practically Speaking…</h3>
      <p>In practical terms, changing the amplitude of a signal is easy. The frequency is a bit harder, but we can arrange for that to change, too. Phase is typically hard to modify though. However, with a little trigonometry we can rewrite that equation: <code>A*cos(2πft+Φ)=I*cos(2πft)-Q*sin(2πft)</code></p>
      <p>That’s a remarkable result. By picking the right I and Q values, you can take a cosine and sine wave and create any arbitrary sine wave you like. If you don’t believe it, have a look at the Trig Identity tab on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r3wyZfLLbBT67eD3yslR7dTSdLF-yN6AAF18R8RSqOs/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>
      <h3>Spreadsheet Time</h3>

      <p>You can set the parameters in column A. Column D is the generated cosine wave using the first formula. Then we generate the zero-phase cosine and sine waves in columns E and F. Finally, we plug in values for I and Q and compute the second equation in column I.</p>
      <p>The I and Q values are calculated. At the point where the cosine in column E is 1, column F will be zero. That means that column D will contain the I value. By the same token, at the point that the sine in column F is 1, the cosine must be zero and, again, column D will have the negative of the Q value (because remember, the Q term is subtracted).</p>
      <p>Playing with this is quite illustrative. Try phase angles of 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 180 degrees. What happens to the I and Q values? What happens to the graphs?</p>
      <p>It is handy to plot the amplitude of the I and Q on a graph where the I component is on the X-axis and the Q is on the Y-axis. You can treat this as a vector — that is, draw a point at (X,Y) = (I, Q) and then draw an arrow from the graph origin to the point. The phase angle of the signal will be the angle between the X axis and the arrow.</p>
      <h4>A Little Trig</h4>

      <p>When you plot a vector like the one here, keep in mind that if you count I as X, Q as Y, and the length of the vector as r, the following relations that include the angle the vector forms with the X-axis (Φ) are true:</p>
      <p>r=(x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup></p>
      <p>cos(Φ)=x/r</p>
      <p>sin(Φ)=y/r</p>
      <p>You might also find the following useful:</p>
      <p>tan(Φ)=sin(Φ)/cosΦ=y/r</p>
      <p>sin<sup>2</sup>(Φ)+cos<sup>2</sup>(Φ)=1</p>
      <h3>Thought Experiments</h3>
      <p>You’ll get more chances to play with these diagrams in the next installment of this series, but for now, consider this. If Q was always zero, you’d get a straight horizontal line with the magnitude of I. If I were zero, you’d get a horizontal line with the magnitude of Q.</p>
      <p>However, for a sine wave, the only zeros come at 1/2 the frequency. For a cosine wave, the zeros start at time zero and also repeat every 180 degrees.</p>
      <p>Make a copy of the spreadsheet and overwrite the values at locations I3 and I4. If you make I and Q the same you will get a vector that is either 45 degrees or 225 degrees. If you make the magnitudes the same but the signs different you will split the other quadrants. What happens if I is greater than Q or vice versa?</p>
      <p>If you set columns B and C to be a sine wave and use the arrow keys on the original spreadsheet (this requires a simple script; you can also just plug an index into E1), you’ll see the vector rotates along with the sine wave’s motion. What happens if I is a sine wave and Q is a cosine wave or vice versa?</p>
      <h3>How Do You Get There?</h3>
      <p>How do you get an arbitrary signal into IQ form? The most common way is to mix it — something we already know how to do — with a reference cosine and sine wave. However, there are other ways, like the Tayloe detector in the video below.</p>

      <p>We will see more of the conventional method next time, but you should really take time to play with these models and get a good feel for how signals decompose into IQ samples.</p>
