      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/damian-lillard">Damian Lillard</a> believes new Trail Blazers teammate <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> can provide crucial help.</p>

      <p>Lillard, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2019/11/portland-trail-blazers-arent-concerned-about-discouraging-start-to-nba-season-should-they-be.html">who says he’s unconcerned</a> about Portland’s early-season struggles, hopes to be “part of a great bounceback for Melo.”</p>

      <p>Per <i><a href="https://theathletic.com/1380391/2019/11/15/with-production-at-power-forward-dwindling-trail-blazers-throw-up-a-desperation-heave-with-carmelo-anthony-signing">The Athletic</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>But signing the 35-year-old forward is a risk the Blazers have to take after losing six of the last seven games while being exposed at power forward. The signing of the 16-year veteran is a clear indication that Blazers management felt it couldn’t wait until Dec. 15 to pursue the expanded trade market, and that the deficit left by the injury to Zach Collins was too great to let go unattended.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>That’s why team star Damian Lillard says signing the 35-year-old is “worth a shot.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“We added a good player,” Lillard said in a text. “Another scoring threat, experience, rebounder.”</i>
