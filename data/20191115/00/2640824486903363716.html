      <p><b>the teams at <a href="https://www.theelectricfactory.com/">the electric factory</a> and <a href="https://www.toyota.com/">toyota</a> uruguay began the project by asking ‘<i>what if the acoustic vehicle alert systems could contribute to the environment besides being functional?’ </i></b>global research on how noise affects plants shows that they react to specific waveform spectrum vibrations. when exposed to a certain range of frequencies, plants show better growth and absorption of nutrients. with this information in mind, they developed the HY project, the first avas sound that benefits the environment while also sitting at a frequency that doesn’t add to noise pollution.</p>

      <p><b>the designers have developed the device to be able to be implemented in any vehicle.</b> its microprocessor is capable of dynamically changing the sound of the car to match its speed. sending over 15 billion instructions per second, the human ear can detect the variation in real-time.</p>
