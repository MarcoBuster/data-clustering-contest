      <p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - Two men have been indicted on first-degree murder charges in the death of a Florida firefighter.</p>
      <p>Court records say a Broward County grand jury formally charged 19-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/torrey-holston/">Torrey Holston</a> and 20-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-garcia-romero/">Jose Garcia Romero</a> on Thursday. Prosecutors haven’t decided whether to seek the death penalty. Both men also are charged with armed robbery and criminal conspiracy.</p>
      <p>Investigators say 39-year-old Christopher Randazzo was fatally shot during a robbery last month in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea. Randazzo was a member of the Coral Springs Fire Department and was last seen leaving a seaside restaurant where he worked as a bartender before becoming a firefighter.</p>
