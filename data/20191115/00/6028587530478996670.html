      <p>In their 2019 report, “Women in the Workplace,” LeanIn.org and McKinsey &amp; Company <a href="https://wiwreport.s3.amazonaws.com/Women_in_the_%20Workplace_2019.pdf">conclude</a>, “the biggest obstacle that women face [in reaching senior leadership] is … at the first step up to manager. Fixing this ‘broken rung’ is the key to achieving parity.” This notion that fixing the bottom rung on women’s advancement ladder will lead to gender parity at all higher leadership levels has been reported on approvingly by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-women-fall-behind-at-work-the-first-step-into-management-11571112361"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/business/broken-rung-corporate-ladder-stops-women-top-report/story?id=%2066262275">ABC News</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-jobs/corporate-ladders-broken-rung-hampering-womens-advancement-in-business-idUSKBN1WU30C">Reuters</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/10/15/fixing-the-broken-rung-could-add-1-million-women-to-management-positions/#2f9e1955399f"><i>Forbes</i></a>, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/16/woman-still-face-critical-broken-rung-on-corporate-ladder/"><i>New York Post</i></a> and many other publications. But is it really true, as the 2019 report claims, that “The broken rung at the step up to manager is the biggest obstacle women face on the path to leadership”? Unquestionably, women’s sharp drop from 48 percent representation at entry level to only 38 percent at manager level is a major problem that has received far too little attention. But it is improbable, at best, that women’s career-advancement difficulties would be solved simply by fixing this “broken rung.” After all, women occupy <a href="https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2018/11/19121654/WomensLeadershipFactSheet.pdf">only 10 percent of top management positions</a> in S&amp;P 1500 companies, make up only <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-management/">11 percent of the top earners</a> in Fortune 500 companies and constitute only <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/facttank/2018/09/26/few-women-lead-large-u-s-companies-despite-modest-gains-over-pastdecade/">12.1 percent of CFOs</a> and the next three highest-paid executives at Fortune 500 companies.</p>
      <p>In their first <a href="https://wiwreport.s3.amazonaws.com/Women_in_the_%20Workplace_2015.pdf">report</a> in 2015 on Women in the Workforce, LeanIn.org and McKinsey found that women are “underrepresented at every level in the corporate pipeline.” That is still the case. It is not just the first rung of women’s leadership ladder that is broken, but <i>every rung of that ladder all the way up</i>. While <a href="https://wiwreport.s3.amazonaws.com/Women_in_the_%20Workplace_2019.pdf">the 2019 report</a> found women’s representation from entry level to manager drops 20 percent, from manager to senior manager it drops 10 percent; from senior manager to vice president it drops 12 percent; from vice president to senior vice president it drops 13 percent; and from senior vice presidents to C-suite executives it drops 19 percent.</p>
      <p>If women were advancing in their careers at rates similar to men, companies would see the same proportion of women at each successive leadership level. But that is not what is happening. Women’s representation drops at each successive rung, which strongly suggests that fixing the bottom rung will do little to increase gender parity higher up.</p>
      <p>The bottom rung <i>and all of the rungs above it </i>are broken because America’s workplaces are gendered: they are led and dominated by men and steeped in masculine norms, values and expectations. As a result, two powerful, if implicit or unconscious, biases limit women’s career advancement: affinity bias and gender bias. </p>
      <p>Affinity bias is the natural, instinctive preference people have to associate with and provide support for people who are like them. Affinity bias, thus, works to divide workplace participants into an “ingroup” and one or more “outgroups.” The ingroup consists of the management team and others who are like them—white, able-bodied, heterosexual men. Because they are an outgroup, women are typically considered for career-enhancing assignments only after their male counterparts; they are asked to join important teams less often than those men; and they are frequently excluded from the ingroup’s all-important informal networks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/gender-bias-in-the-workplace">Gender bias</a> is the assumption that men are superior to women at leadership, high-pressure assignments and difficult negotiations. Because of gender bias, women are judged more critically, held to higher standards and paid less for similar work than comparably situated men.</p>
      <p>Affinity bias and gender bias work in tandem to deliver a one-two blow to women’s career advancement opportunities. Women are not just seen as different from members of the ingroup, they are regarded as less competent, ambitious and competitive than those male members. As a result, no matter on which rung of the leadership ladder women stand, their career-enhancing resources, opportunities and visibility are more limited than their male counterparts.</p>
      <p>Achieving workplace gender parity depends on fixing <i>all</i> rungs of women’s advancement ladder. This requires addressing the affinity and gender biases that are so pervasive in gendered workplaces. Women can do a great deal on their own to avoid or overcome these biases by mastering impression management, the principal thrust of my 2016 book, <i>Breaking Through Bias: Communication Techniques for Women to Succeed at Work</i>. Ultimately, however, the problem of women’s systematic disadvantages in the pursuit of career advancement will depend on organizations adopting truly comprehensive multipart programs for diversifying their leadership ranks, such as that recommended in my 2019 book, <i>It’s Not You, It’s the Workplace: Women’s Conflict at Work at the Bias that Built It</i>. Unfortunately, neither of these steps is meaningfully addressed in the 2019 Women in the Workplace report.</p>
