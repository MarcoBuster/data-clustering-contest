      <p><i>By Arvin Patel, EVP and Chief Intellectual Property Officer (CIPO), TiVo</i> With the November 1 launch of Apple TV+, Apple has become the latest digital media juggernaut to enter <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/arvinpatel/2019/08/06/streamageddon-consumers-want-options-without-cost/#3fd7a4fb1709">the Streaming Wars</a>. Although Apple’s entry into the OTT streaming space has been much anticipated by Apple enthusiasts and industry observers, Apple TV+ is going to face an uphill battle in gaining market share from Netflix, Hulu, HBO and all the rest—which all have their own special sauce: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Netflix has first-mover advantage and market saturation.</li>
        <li>Disney owns pop culture and kids’ content.</li>
        <li>NBCUniversal’s parent company owns the cable pipes.</li>
        <li>Warner Media has a compelling and diverse content library, not to mention its parent company owns a wireless network.</li>
        <li>Amazon has so many other sources of revenue that Prime Video hardly matters; streaming video could be an eternal loss-leader for Amazon and Jeff Bezos wouldn’t care. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What about the argument that content is king, and if you create great shows, the audience will come? Apple has been touting its multi-billion-dollar investment in original content. But so far, Apple TV+’s slate of shows—<i>The Morning Show, For All Mankind, See </i>and <i>Dickinson‑—</i>are getting “meh” reviews despite the star power of Jennifer Aniston, Reece Witherspoon, Steve Carell, and Jason Momoa. <i>Game of Thrones</i> they are not. </p>
      <p>Apple’s pricing—$4.99 per month—is aggressive. Is it giving consumers the same value as the Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+ bundle, or Amazon Prime Video that’s included with the Amazon Prime service? And if the original content isn’t great, will consumers be motivated to add yet another streaming service to the jumble of their daily lives as online viewers? Only time, ratings and traction will tell. </p>
      <p>So seriously, how is Apple going to compete in the streaming wars and attract audience share without blockbuster original content? What’s Apple’s “special sauce?” </p>
      <p>
        <b>Apple is all about their brand—and it shows!</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.interbrand.com/best-brands/best-global-brands/2019/ranking/">Interbrand</a>, Apple is the world’s #1 brand in 2019. The famous logo alone is worth a cool $234.2 million. (Amazon is #3 at $125 million, and Disney is at #10 with $44.3M). That means consumers are willing to pay extra for something just because Apple’s name is on it.</p>
      <p>Just look at the millions of Apple fans who line up every time Apple offers a new product, even if it’s not significantly better than a competitor’s product in features or quality. Even Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak would wait in line because he loved experiencing the thrill himself. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-overnight-new-apple-iphone-ipad-2017-5">Wozniak</a> compared the night before an Apple release to waiting in line for concert tickets.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, Apple has a built-in audience of brand evangelists who will try anything Apple. And Apple is trying to turn that brand love into subscribers by offering a year of Apple TV+ free to everyone who bought a new Apple product after September 10<sup>th</sup> of this year.</p>
      <p>If Apple is even slightly successful in converting its existing customers into Apple TV+ subscribers, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/apple-tv-will-become-a-9-billion-business-by-2025.html">Morgan Stanley estimates</a> the service could be worth $9 billion in revenue by 2025.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Apple Owns the Screen</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/29/apple-1-4-billion-active-devices/">1.4 billion active devices worldwide</a>, including 900 million iPhones. Hundreds of millions of people are already spending hours each day looking at Apple screens—iPhones, iPads, Macs, and a few televisions hooked up to Apple TV devices. Is that as much of an advantage as owning the network pipes? Probably not, but it gives Apple control of the interface and the ability to serve out updates and embed features in its OS to support the streaming service. </p>
      <p>This expansive foundation of active devices also gives Apple a good window into metrics like user attention, which will be crucial to the pricing of advertising on digital services moving forward.</p>
      <p>This is the kind of thing that got Microsoft and Google in anti-trust trouble, of course, so Apple will need to proceed cautiously. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Apple Has Other Lines of Business</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apple is the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2019/05/15/worlds-largest-tech-companies-2019/#12c31d48734f">world’s largest technology company, with annual profits of $59 billion</a>, and is sitting on one of the world’s biggest piles of cash—<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/apple-aapl-q4-2019-has-205point9-billion-cash-earnings-indicate.html">$205.9 billion at last count</a>. If the Streaming Wars come down to “who can afford to lose more money chasing market share?” then Apple has a great chance. </p>
      <p>Fortunately for Apple, the company has several powerful advantages that could make it a viable competitor in the forthcoming Streaming Wars. It won’t happen overnight, and there will be some hits and misses along the way. But Apple TV+ definitely has the potential to be a big player in OTT content. </p>
