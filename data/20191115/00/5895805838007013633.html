      <h2>Narcissists think you can judge a book by its cover, so they dress to impress.</h2>

      <p>Most of us can trust our instincts to “know a narcissist when we see one.” In fact, researchers have determined that narcissists are more likely to wear flashy or expensive clothing and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/narcissism">narcissistic</a> women tend to be more pronounced in the make-up they wear and the cleavage they show than those who don’t score as high on narcissistic traits. Narcissists like to be noticed and revel in the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a> they draw. Not only does their attire grab attention, one study found that they are the most attractive types of individuals at the "zero acquaintance" level – not only due to their appearance, but also due to a couple of qualities that may be both oddly appealing, yet quite treacherous — they are exploitative and have a high sense of entitlement (Back, Schmukle, &amp; Egloff, 2010). Before you even realize the trap you've fallen into, a narcissist can suck you into a relationship with their <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/charisma">charm</a> and false aura of "elitism." They know how to get us to bend to their desires before we even know their names!</p>
      <h4>Labels Matter to a Narcissist</h4>
      <p>There are two general types of narcissists, the grandiose and the vulnerable; both types have inflated egos, but they differ in how they engage with the world and with others. In a study exploring the relationship between narcissists and their loyalty to product brands, grandiose narcissists were more likely to select brands that they believed were considered the “best” or, more simply, expensive and elitist (Lambert &amp; Desmond, 2013). They chose clothing, for instance, that represented the highest status. They also took pleasure in choosing a particular brand even when that brand might only be recognized for its true worth and cost by those other individuals who could afford it, as well.</p>
      <p>The less grandiose narcissists also chose their clothing and other products with discerning intention. However, their motives may seem a bit askew from why you might choose your own face wash, linens, dresses, or suits. These narcissists chose specific items because of the image that they wanted to project and because of the unique, and often "uniquely quirky," style that they wanted others to perceive that they embodied. It wasn't so much that they had an affinity for the product itself, it was the product's image that mattered most.</p>
      <h4>What’s Beneath the Sartorial Splendor?</h4>
      <p>Grandiose narcissists are typically more effective in winning over admirers and entertaining others early in relationships. They use people, though, the way directors use props or scenery – to create a particular effect for a scene. Grandiose narcissists are born understanding how to make themselves appear larger than life and as if they were actually starring in a production starring themselves as themselves. Vulnerable narcissists experience frustration that they are unable to "stage" their lives or the people that surround them in the manner that they believe befits their superior status.</p>
      <h4>Vulnerable Narcissists are Dysfunctionally Aggressive</h4>
      <p>Vulnerable narcissists may seem to draw less attention to themselves in a public setting, but they have extremely high expectations of being the center of attention in one-on-one relationships. When a vulnerable narcissist doesn’t get their way or what they feel is owed them by others or the world, in general, they take this as a blow to their pride and their fragile <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem">self-esteem</a> and lash out in ways that may surprise others with their magnitude and their venom. When a vulnerable narcissist is blocked from getting their way, they translate this into an attack and lash out with surprisingly hostile and vicious <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">aggression</a> fueled by narcissistic rage.</p>
      <h4>Grandiose Narcissists Wield Aggression as a Weapon</h4>
      <p>Grandiose narcissists also suffer from too much pride, but they typically use aggression as a weapon, not a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/defense-mechanisms">defense mechanism</a>. They wield aggression as a tool to manipulate the situation and others around them to bend to their desires. While the vulnerable narcissist is more likely to suffer from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/embarrassment">shame</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/jealousy">envy</a>, and taking pleasure in the suffering of others (schadenfreude), the grandiose narcissist spends much more time taking pleasure in the real or imagined success of themselves. That’s why grandiose narcissists typically enjoy significantly higher well-being than the more vulnerable type (Czarna, Zajenkowski, &amp; Dufner, 2018). They also are more likely to display positive emotionality than the more negative vulnerable type.</p>
      <h4>How do you Defend your Heart from Narcissists?</h4>
      <p>The most dangerous aspect of narcissists is that once they “choose you,” they may pursue you relentlessly and effectively. They are stars at manipulation and can be uncanny in their ability to read others. If you detect that a potential partner is becoming more demanding than is comfortable or is trying to insinuate themselves more deeply into your life before you feel ready to let someone in that close, listen to your heart. While you may believe that you can help “heal” a narcissist through your love and commitment, you must remember that narcissists do not believe they have any flaws or faults that actually “need” healing. Narcissists aren’t ashamed of their narcissistic behaviors, they show their true colors with no hesitation. They may not like others to label them a narcissist, but if you ask them if they are, they’ll often freely admit it.</p>
      <h4>Get Out before You’re In Too Deep</h4>
      <p>When someone seems to be taking up too much space in your life and it seems that the relationship is moving too fast too soon, you owe it to yourself to put on the brakes and extricate yourself from the relationship before it becomes too complicated to exit without exertion or drama.</p>
      <p>Being perceived as an addition to a narcissist’s personal tableau may make you feel special for a minute, but the long term prospect of being a prop, not a person, isn’t nearly as attractive as the narcissist would have you believe.</p>
