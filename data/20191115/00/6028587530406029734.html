      <p>Kate Hudson Googled me.As we kick off our phone call to discuss her latest endeavor—the launch of her very own vodka brand—Hudson mentions a few articles I wrote that she found online. “I like to check in on people before I talk to them,” she says. </p>
      <p>Hudson’s curiosity and due diligence go beyond mere Internet searches ahead of interviews. It becomes quickly apparent that her success—from a decades-long career in acting to a pretty established athleisure company, Fabletics—is in part due to her ability to discern what the public craves and how it craves it.</p>
      <p>Latest case in point: King St. Vodka. “I’ve been asked a lot to endorse products and I much prefer building businesses than endorsing other people’s,” she says. “So I looked into the vodka world.” Hudson developed the seven-times distilled, gluten-free, non-GMO vodka with partner David Kanbar—who co-created Skinnygirl with Bethenny Frankel—after noticing a need in the industry. “I realized it’s such a male dominated [world],” she says. “The numbers for vodka especially skew higher in women and I realized nothing is really marketed towards women in a way that we actually like.” </p>
      <p>But Hudson hopes to do more for female kind than create a product geared towards women (“without alienating men, because we love them too”): she wants them to be part of the story. “I have this idea of finding all the female farmers that are [producing] non-GMO corn,” she says. “I want to support female independent farmers.” The company is currently in the process of vetting out farms across America.</p>
      <p>Speaking of marketing, personal touches abound: Hudson lived on King Street in New York City for about a decade, vodka is her go-to liquor and she helped design the bottle’s packaging. </p>
      <p>Although clearly excited about the product itself, it would be journalistic blasphemy not to note that Hudson hasn’t appeared in a movie since 2017’s <i>Marshall</i>. Is King St. Vodka—and Fabletics, for that matter—a way to stay relevant in the public eye? “If I thought it was about being relevant, I probably would be working more in acting,” she says. “I find that there’s an opportunity to create trusting businesses: so there’s an opportunity for me to do things that allow me to stay at home with my kids and more in one place.” She goes on: “That being said, I just think it’s really fun. I think some artists are quite introverted and they internalize their creativity but I love connecting with people, I’ll start doing an interview and I just babble forever.”</p>
      <p>That babble eventually leads us to a discussion about social media in general and her very active, very public and very followed (11.1 million people keep track of her) Instagram account in specific. Known for her candor and the seemingly endless access to her personal life that she affords fans on the platform, Hudson’s social media presence is certainly deliberate and mostly appears to be an activity she enjoys but is it something she feels forced to do given the shifting nature of celebrities in a 2019 defined by constant connection?</p>
      <p>“I grew up in the business in Hollywood at a very different time than it is now,” she says. “When I came up, you were still the person behind the curtain. You weren’t in front of it. When people got to go behind the curtain and really get a piece of your life, it was an event. It was unexpected.” That all changed as fame knocked on her door: “All of a sudden [...] the digital age was booming: websites! Internet! iPhone!,” she remembers. “I was raised to feel like I needed to keep my life private [but] as the business world started to expand and the world became so connected, you realized that the more you hide, the more exhausting it is.”</p>
      <p>To cope with the public knocking down the door to her privacy, Hudson opted to leave that door open herself: “It felt liberating to go ‘I don’t really care about hiding anything anymore.’ Obviously, there are certain things I hold sacred but, on the whole, I kind of feel good about the fact that I don’t have to protect that anymore.”</p>
