      <p>In the age of modern television, nothing sells better than the revival of a classic series. And while many networks have pushed a variety of them, none of been more keen on the idea than Fox. Whether it be <i>24</i> or <i>The X-Files</i> or <i>Prison Break</i>, there are few things Fox loves more than breathing fresh life into its beloved classics. Now, fifteen years after the debut of one such series, it feels like a good time for the network to consider an event series revival for the infamous <i>House</i>.Created by <i>The Good Doctor</i>’s David Shore and starring now household name Hugh Laurie, <i>House</i> was a show that, in keeping with Fox tradition, broke all the rules of what a prime-time medical show should be. Its main character was mean, addicted to pain killers and often inappropriate. But, he was also a genius with a very high batting average. And, since his exit from television in 2012, almost every medical drama to follow has tried to recapture the show’s magic to little success. <i>House</i> was a great procedural built around a truly entertaining individual that made the show come to life week after week.</p>
      <p>Additionally, what many forget about the show is that it’s a true audience made series that wouldn’t have made it without the luck of good mid-season scheduling for its re-runs.</p>
      <p>Your calendars don’t deceive you. <i>House</i> debuted on Fox on November 16, 2004, with a rating just over seven million (average numbers for 2004). But, the show managed to rake in a massive nineteen million viewers by its first season finale in May 2005. So, what happened?</p>
      <p>Well, what didn’t happen was an upward trajectory week to week following its debut. In fact, the first six weeks following the series premiere came in under the initial seven, topping just barely under seven million on December 28th, 2004. But then, the show returned from its first mid-season break in January 2005 to a massive twelve million viewers. Why? The luck of being in close proximity to the then juggernaut that was <i>American Idol</i>.</p>
      <p>This is the same principle that lifted other Fox hit, <i>Bones</i>. By being in close proximity to the reality smash, despite not airing on the same night, once the competition series returned for its third season, so did viewers to the network who were being shown reruns of the show for the first time in lead-out slots. There are even some cases of early <i>House </i>episodes doing better in their re-run airings than their debuts.</p>
      <p>From that point, the show took off and would go on to spend six seasons with comfortable double-digit ratings before finally losing steam in season seven and eventually coming to an end in season eight. But, in that time, the show served as a Super Bowl lead-out and ended up, at one point, becoming the most-watched series globally.</p>
      <p><i>House</i> was a phenomenon seldom talked about… but maybe it’s time for that to change.</p>

      <p>Creatively, there’s a lot that can be mined from the intervening eight years since its close. Did House fulfill his promise to Thirteen to end her life when Huntington's disease took it over? Did he ever reconcile with Cuddy? And, most importantly, how did he handle the death of his long-time friend Wilson, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in the final season?</p>
      <p>There wouldn’t be enough material to revive the show long term (nor should that be the goal). But, as a limited series one-off that is built purely on the “what happened next” of it all, there’s no reason not to bring the show back. It could be like a medical road show featuring <i>House</i> in a new location every episode as he remembers what happened in the time since we last saw him.</p>
      <p>Also, on the business end, the incentive grows greater with two good options for the show.</p>
      <p>Option one would be to bring the series back on its foundational network Fox, who is in need of some solid hits during its new age as an “independent” network. Using <i>House</i> to launch a piece of new hotness would be a very wise move.</p>
      <p>Option two, while trickier, would fall in line with the new age of proprietary IP. While the series aired on Fox, it was owned by Universal Television, which makes it a prime target for the forthcoming Peacock streaming service. As yet another hot revival to add to the current streamer’s slate (which is also set to include all the old episodes of the series), a revival could go a long way to strengthening the must have nature of the service.</p>
      <p><i>House</i> was a great series that ended on a note that may not have left the door open for more in 2012, but most certainly could be opened for more in 2019. If there’s any character worth a fresh adventure with, it’s the esteemed Gregory House. That’s for certain.</p>
