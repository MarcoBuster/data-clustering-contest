      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/xeni_jardin" target="_blank">Xeni Jardin</a></address>
      <p>Donald Trump has long made a sport of mocking Amazon founder and Washington Post newspaper owner Jeff Bezos, and Jeff Bezos is well aware of this.</p>
      <p>Microsoft just won a $10 billion so-called “war cloud” contract with Donald Trump's administration for Pentagon cloud-based computing.</p>
      <p>Amazon wanted that $10 billion Pentagon contract.</p>
      <p>Amazon, the company founded by Jeff Bezos, plans to dispute the contract process, claiming “unmistakable bias.”</p>

      <p>Amazon filed a formal protest in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which deals with financial claims against the federal government, <a href="https://apnews.com/e27f0ff8a1994bf183a503c2398f235b">reports the Associated Press on Thursday</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Amazon’s competitive bid for the “war cloud” project drew criticism from President Donald Trump and its business rivals. The project, formally called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, pitted leading tech titans Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and IBM against one another <br/><br/>In a statement, Amazon said that “numerous aspects” of the bidding process involved “clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias.” It did not elaborate.<br/><br/><b>Amazon</b> added that “it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.”</blockquote>
      <p><b>Microsoft</b> has not yet commented on the matter.</p>
