      <h1>John Kennedy rips ‘latte-drinking, avocado toast-eating’ e</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>Sen. John Kennedy ripped the “latte-drinking, avocado toast-eating” elite during President Trump’s rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone in Louisiana on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In a short speech, Mr. Kennedy fired up the Bossier City crowd by declaring himself a “deplorable” — a reference to the infamous 2016 insult Hillary Clinton used to describe Trump supporters.</p>
      <p>“I stand before you tonight as a proud deplorable,” the senator said. “And, unlike some of the folks in Washington, D.C. — I’m talking about the cultured, cosmopolitan, goat’s milk latte-drinking, avocado toast-eating insiders elite — as a deplorable, I believe that everybody counts. And I care about you, and so does the president of the United States of America.”</p>

      <p>“Unless you’re happy with crappy, vote for Eddie Rispone for governor,” the senator shouted. “Unless you’re happy with crappy, vote for Kyle Ardoin for secretary of state. Unless you’re happy with crappy, vote for Robert Mills for the state Senate. God bless America. God bless our president and God bless the state of Louisiana.”</p>
