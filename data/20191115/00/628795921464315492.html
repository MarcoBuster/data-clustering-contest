      <p><a href="https://www.narragunnawali.org.au/">Narragunnawali</a> is part of <a href="https://www.reconciliation.org.au/">Reconciliation Australia </a>and supports early learning services and schools to foster knowledge and pride in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures.</p>
      <p>The Narragunnawali Awards, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.bhp.com/community/bhp-foundation">BHP Foundation</a>, celebrate early learning services and schools that are striving for a just, equitable and reconciled Australia.</p>
      <p>CEO for Reconciliation Australia, Karen Mundine, said all the finalists, and those commended, have enthusiastically embraced reconciliation, saying she was “so impressed by the calibre and creativity of the nominees this year, and particularly of the finalists.”</p>
      <p>Those in contention for the awards have been working in partnership with Elders, Traditional Owners and community members to ensure teaching and learning is relevant to their local community context, actively engaging with the true histories of the Country on which their learning environment respectively stands, and exploring themes of racism, holistic approaches to wellbeing, land management practices and sustainability, Ms Mundine said.</p>
      <p>She described the work of the nominees as part of a broader movement of Australians “learning, unlearning and relearning our shared histories in schools and early learning services around the country.”</p>
      <p>Early learning finalists for the Narragunnawali Awards 2019 were Forbes Preschool Kindergarten (NSW) and <a href="https://www.barefootearlychildhood.com.au/">Barefoot Early Childhood</a> (QLD).
