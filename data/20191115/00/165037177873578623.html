        <b>Santi Cazorla scored his first Spain goal for four years as two debutants also got on the scoresheet in a 7-0 thrashing of Malta in Euro 2020 qualifying on Friday</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Santi Cazorla</b> scored his first <b>Spain </b>goal for four years as two debutants also got on the scoresheet in a 7-0 thrashing of Malta in the Euro qualifying on Friday.</p>
      <p>The <b>Villarreal veteran struck 41 minutes</b> in after <b>Alvaro Morata</b> had put Robert Moreno's men ahead, before the <b>floodgates opened in the second half</b> at Estadio Ramon de Carranza.</p>
      <p>Moreno made seven changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Sweden last time out and handed debuts to <b>Pau Torres</b> and <b>Dani Olmo</b> in the second half, each of whom <b>repaid him with a goal.</b></p>
      <p>A fine strike from <b>Pablo Sarabia</b>, a simple finish for the impressive <b>Gerard Moreno</b> and a late <b>Jesus Navas</b> effort secured a resounding victory in Cadiz for a Spain side who were already assured of their place at next year's finals.</p>
      <p>Morata scored his seventh goal in as many games for club and country with 23 minutes gone, bundling a finish beyond goalkeeper Henry Bonello after Gerard Moreno turned a loose ball goalwards.</p>
      <p>It was Morata who prevented Spain doubling their lead 27 minutes in, the striker judged to be interfering with play from an offside position when Moreno blasted home the rebound after a brilliant Bonello save denied Sergio Ramos.</p>

      <p><b>Moreno somehow failed to turn Sarabia's cross into an unguarded net,</b> but the second goal did come - <b>and in some style</b> - four minutes before the break. Cazorla gathered Moreno's first-time pass and slotted the ball in off the left-hand post for his first international goal since 2015.</p>

      <p>Cazorla went off to a <b>standing ovation eight minutes after the restart</b> as Spain set about securing the result, with only a <b>brilliant clearance off the line</b> from Jonathan Caruana denying Sarabia.</p>
      <p>Spain ended the match as a contest with two goals in the space of a minute, Torres chesting the ball in from Paco Alcacer's flick-on from a corner before Sarabia arrowed a left-footed finish into the top-right corner from Moreno's lay-off.</p>
      <p><b>Olmo became the second debutant to get on the scoresheet</b>, rounding the goalkeeper before slotting home after the Malta defence was split by Thiago's pass, and Moreno at last got his goal when he tapped in Juan Bernat's cut-back.</p>
      <p>Navas capped a fine outing for Spain with the goal of the game <b>five minutes from time,</b> sending a dipping strike over the stranded Bonello from 25 yards out.</p>
