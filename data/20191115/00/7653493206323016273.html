      <h1>Dell Takes On Amazon &amp; Microsoft With Subscription Service</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/jan-arreza/" target="_blank">Jan Arreza</a></address>
      <p>Dell, a major partner of JB Hi Fi, who at the same time invests heavily in driving traffic to its own website, is set to roll out a direct sell B2B subscription service in a bid to counter the lure of cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
      <p>With the new service, Dell will be offering business clients more flexible, on-demand buying options for products like servers and personal computers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/newsroom/announcements/detailpage.press-releases~usa~2019~11~20191112-dell-technologies-on-demand.htm#/filter-on/Country:en-us"><u>Dell Technologies On-Demand</u></a>, the new consumption-based and as-a-service offering, provides its customers with more choice, flexibility and consistency in the consumption of delivery of modern IT infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“We really think it’s an important time for Dell to simplify the way we offer our portfolio and meet customers’ needs,” Sam Grocott, Dell’s senior vice-president of Product Marketing, told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/dell-unveils-subscription-model-to-counter-amazon-microsoft"><u><i>Bloomberg</i></u></a>.</p>
      <p>“This type of a model – as a service – was born in the cloud. As organisations have leveraged this model in the past, they have come to like it.”</p>
      <p>The range of technologies on which Dell offers the pay-per-use model includes storage, computing, virtualisation and networking, and allows for a pricing model where customers only pay for what they use.</p>

      <p>Dell is offering three pricing structures – Pay As You Grow, Flex On Demand, and the Data Centre Utility.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/payment-solutions/flexible-consumption/pay-as-you-grow.htm"><u>Pay As You Grow</u></a>, organisations can pay for their estimated IT needs based on their business growth.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/payment-solutions/flexible-consumption/flex-on-demand.htm"><u>Flex On Demand</u></a> on the other hand offers a plan where enterprises can pay for hybrid cloud support based on their needs, while <a href="https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/payment-solutions/flexible-consumption/data-center-utility.htm"><u>Data Centre Utility</u></a> is usually saved for deployments on a massive scale.</p>
      <p>“The multi-cloud world is here and will only grow, which means customers need on-demand and consistent infrastructure that yield predictable outcomes across all of their clouds, data centres and edge locations,” Jeff Clarke, Dell Technologies vice-chairman, told <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/dell-launches-dell-technologies-on-demand"><u><i>TechRadar</i></u></a>.</p>
      <p>“Dell Technologies On-Demand makes it possible for organisations to plan, deploy and manage their entire IT footprint.”</p>
      <p>“They can choose how they consume and pay for IT solutions that meet their needs with the freedom and flexibility to evolve as their needs change over time.”</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/dell-unveils-subscription-model-to-counter-amazon-microsoft"><u><i>Bloomberg</i></u></a>, while Dell’s overall sales climbed 2% in the last quarter, while demand for its servers and networking gear had dropped 12% compared to the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Grocott said that Dell still expects the vast majority of customers to pay upfront for products in the next three to five years.</p>
