      <p>Staycationing means different things to different people. For some, a dedicated staycation may mean just taking a few days off to relax at home, finally binge watch <i>Succession </i>and cozy up under the sheets. Others may take the time to explore their neighborhood, eat at the local restaurants they’ve missed or see a well-known site city dwellers are known to ignore on busy day-to-day lives. Whether your staycationer is exploring or nesting (or doing a little bit of both), these gifts will enhance their time off.</p>
