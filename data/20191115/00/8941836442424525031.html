      <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Sutter Health agreed to pay more than $45 million to settle a lawsuit that accused it of paying doctors in exchange for patient referrals and resolve other violations, federal officials said Friday.</p>
      <p>The company agreed to pay $30.5 to settle a 2014 lawsuit filed by the government and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laurie-hanvey/">Laurie Hanvey</a>, a whistleblower who once worked for Sutter as its compliance officer.</p>
      <p>The Department of Justice said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sutter/">Sutter</a> also agreed to pay more than $15 million to resolve other violations that resulted from its investigation, including double-billing Medicare.</p>

      <p>The suit remained sealed until Thursday, the Sacramento Bee reported.</p>

      <p>Information from: The Sacramento Bee, http://www.sacbee.com</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laurie-hanvey/">Hanvey</a>’s attorney, Michael Hirst, said the government will pay $5.8 million to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laurie-hanvey/">Hanvey</a> and her attorneys from the settlement amount after bringing her claims to the attention of officials.</p>
      <p>“When kickbacks are paid and received, patients are right to worry whether recommended procedures at recommended hospitals are reasonable and necessary,” Hirst said.</p>
      <p>Sutter officials said in a statement the settlement resolves overpayments that Sutter had received from the government. They said the company did not concede any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laurie-hanvey/">Hanvey</a> joined <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sutter/">Sutter</a> in 2012 and within 13 months began to question payments and timesheets that were brought to her attention by a specialist in accounts payable, the lawsuit said.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit alleges a pattern of wrongdoing involving Sutter and a number of medical practices in Sacramento, Modesto, the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Among them was the Sacramento Cardiovascular Surgeons Medical Group Inc., a group of three surgeons accused of cutting a deal with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sutter/">Sutter</a> starting in 2006 that provided free physician assistants to the group in exchange for the surgeons referring patients to Sutter hospitals.</p>
        <p>Sutter agreed to pay the $170,000 salary of each assistant while the surgeons’ group “did in fact bill third-party payers, including Medicare,” for some of the assistants’ services, the lawsuit says.</p>
        <p>The group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
        <p>Hirst said the group reached a settlement agreement - without admitting liability - that calls for it to pay the government $506,000, with $96,140 of that to go to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laurie-hanvey/">Hanvey</a>.</p>
