      <p><a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Ted%20Hughes">Ted Hughes</a>’s 1997 translation of tales from <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Ovid">Ovid</a>’s <i>Metamorphoses</i> begins, “Now I am ready to tell how bodies are changed / Into different bodies.” <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Amy%20Nathan">Amy Nathan</a>’s solo show “Glyph Slipper” presents drawings and sculptures that reimagine such changes, as well as the tools women use to transform and protect themselves in a misogynist world.</p>
      <p><i>Lady Slipper</i> (all works 2019) is an inky abstraction of hands turning into high heels, and hangs near <i>Fingertip Array</i>, which depicts a grid of fingernails painted bright red. In another corner of the gallery, giant bobby pins open up into right angles in the sculpture <i>Flush, per se</i>; the vertical segments are dark maroon and yellow-brown, like saplings stretching up to the sky, while the horizontal portions are blue and wavy like a river. These more contemporary-seeming works frame the back of the gallery, where Nathan has created a mythological landscape exploring the forms of control over women’s bodies. <i>Forever separated, forever attached</i> appears to represent the head of Medusa, who was turned into a snake-haired monster after Poseidon raped her, and was then decapitated by Perseus, who used her head as a weapon to turn people into stone. Once, after defeating a sea monster to save Andromeda, <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Ovid">Ovid</a> writes, Perseus wrapped the head in seaweed, which turned into coral by morning. Nathan’s interpretation of this story involved pressing seaweed, ropes, and shells into a rectangle of clay that was then cast in plaster and embedded within a wooden panel, creating a tangle of marks surrounded by white teardrop shapes on a terra-cotta-colored background.</p>
      <p>Nathan used a similar process for <i>Andromeda</i>, pressing seashells and rope knots into clay later cast in plaster to map the titular galaxy. An actual rope ties the resulting tablet to a rock, alluding to Andromeda’s being bound to a rock until Perseus rescued her. Though their references are as wide-ranging as their forms, Nathan’s works exhibit a playful hand adept at using symbols to tell some of the oldest but still urgent stories of human relations.</p>
