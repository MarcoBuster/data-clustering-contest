      <h2>It was another eventful night in the association, with returns from injury, exciting homecomings and a certain big-name signing.</h2>

      <p>Well, other than <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/carmelo-anthony/">Carmelo Anthony</a> being signed by the Blazers, <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/paul-george/">Paul George </a>balling out in his first game as a Clipper and <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/kristaps-porzingis/">Kristaps Porzingis</a> returning to the Mecca, it was a slow news day in the league.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Heat 108 (8-3), Cavaliers 97 (4-7)</b>
      </p>
      <p>How can you not love this Heat team? With a hard-working culture cultivated by coach Erik Spoelstra and enforced by star <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/jimmy-butler/">Jimmy Butler</a>, the Heat have gotten off to an excellent start to the season. Rookie sensation <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/kendrick-nunn/">Kendrick Nunn</a> did it again, going for 23 points, five rebounds, eight assists and two steals.</p>
      <p>The Cavs have performed above expectations thus far this season, and it’s great to see <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/kevin-love/">Kevin Love</a> back to his old double-double ways (he dropped 21 points, 10 boards and four steals).</p>

      <p><b>Pelicans 132 (3-8)</b>, <b>Clippers 127 (7-5)</b></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/jrue-holiday/">Jrue Holiday</a> (36 points, seven assists, six steals) and <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/derrick-favors/">Derrick Favors</a> (20 points, 20 boards) spoiled Paul George’s first game as a Clipper in a stunning upset.</p>
      <p>George stuffed the stat sheet in his debut with 33 points, nine rebounds and four assists with a perfect 10-10 from the free throw stripe in only 24 minutes, but it simply was not enough.</p>

        <b>Bucks 124 (8-3), Bulls 115 (4-8)</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/giannis-antetokounmpo/">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> continued his stellar campaign, taking care of business against the Bulls by scoring 38 points, inhaling 16 rebounds and swiping three steals. The Greek Freak is on another level right now, and there’s nothing anybody can do to stop him.</p>
      <p>For the Bulls, rookie <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/coby-white/">Coby White </a>once again showed his high-confidence, shooting 23 times and scoring 26 points off the bench, while <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/zach-lavine/">Zach LaVine</a> chipped in 25 points, seven assists and three steals.</p>

        <b>Knicks 106 (3-9), Mavericks 103 (6-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>What a thriller! Anytime a star player returns to the city they left, there are usually some fireworks, and this game did not disappoint. We had Frankie Smokes and <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/luka-doncic/">Luka Doncic</a> fighting for a loose ball, <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/dwight-powell/">Dwight Powell</a> tipping a shot with 0.1 seconds left on the shot clock, deafening boos and finally, an icy <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/jrue-holiday/">Marcus Morris</a> step-back dagger to seal the Knicks win.</p>
      <p>In what is becoming a regular occurance, Luka indeed dropped another triple double with 33 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists, while Porzingis added 20 points, 11 boards and three blocks.</p>
      <p>Behind a balanced Knicks effort led by Morris’ 20 points, The Garden was rocking once again.</p>

        <b>Suns 128 (7-4), Hawks 112 (4-7)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Phoenix Suns, man. They were completely disrespected all preseason, and have been taking care of business so far. <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/Kelly-Oubre/">Kelly Oubre</a> (a League Fits stud by the way) scored 30 points, while <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/devin-booker/">Devin Booker</a> (27 points) and <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/dario-saric/">Dario Saric</a> (23 points) followed suit.</p>
      <p>It was not one of <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/trae-young/">Trae Young’</a>s more efficient games, but the man still put up 21 points, 13 assists and two steals. A respectable effort amidst defeat.</p>

        <b>Nuggets 101 (8-3), Nets 93 (4-7)</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a very rare occurrence this season, not one player in this game scored at least 20 points. And while the aesthetics haven’t been pretty, the Nuggets keep gutting out wins. <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/nikola-jokic/">Nikola Jokic</a> contributed 18 points and 10 rebounds, which are modest numbers for the Serbian stud, but hey, whatever it takes.</p>
      <p>Expectations were slightly tempered for the Nets because of a certain 6’11 superstar-sized gaping hole in the lineup. A 4-7 start though causes for some mild concern, especially with guard <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/caris-levert/">Caris LeVert</a> missing a month of action due to injury. The team lacks shot creation and playmaking outside of <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/kyrie-irving/">Kyrie Irving</a> and <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/tag/spencer-dinwiddie/">Spencer Dinwiddie</a>, and they just haven’t been able to click as of yet. Definitely a situation to monitor.</p>
