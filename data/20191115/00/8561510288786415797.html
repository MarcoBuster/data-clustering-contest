      <h1>Ammunition Stockpiles Are Exploding As Global Temps Rise</h1>

      <h3>Unplanned Explosions</h3>
      <p>More than <a href="http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/weapons-and-markets/stockpiles/unplanned-explosions-at-munitions-sites.html">600 times</a> in the past four decades, sites where militaries store their ammunition and explosives have blown up unexpectedly, sometimes killing as many as <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-arms-depot-explosion-rocks-lagos">1,000 people</a> at once.</p>
      <p>While many of these <a href="http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/weapons-and-markets/stockpiles/unplanned-explosions-at-munitions-sites/definition-classification.html">unplanned explosions at munitions sites</a> are later attributed to human error or improper storage, the causes of most are never determined.</p>
      <p>But experts interviewed for a new <i>Scientific American</i> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-may-be-blowing-up-arms-depots/">investigation</a> blame heat for the phenomenon — and say that global warming could dramatically increase the number of explosions in the future.</p>
      <h3>Hot in Here</h3>
      <p>Experts told <i>SA</i> that higher temperatures can weaken the structural integrity of stored military weapons and ammunition. And when <i>SA</i> analyzed data from the <a href="http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/weapons-and-markets/stockpiles/unplanned-explosions-at-munitions-sites.html">arms-monitoring Small Arms Survey</a>, it found that the weapon explosions were about 60 percent more likely to occur between late-April and mid-September — the hottest period of the year.</p>
      <p>“As climate change raises summer temperatures and boosts the number and severity of heat waves the world over,” <i>SA</i> wrote, “weapons experts warn of more of such unplanned explosions… particularly in places that are already steeped in conflict or have poor stockpile management, or both.”</p>
      <h3>Human Error</h3>
      <p>Hotter temperatures don’t just affect the explosives directly, either — soldiers told <i>SA</i> the extreme heat of summer causes them to experience “foggy decision-making” that can lead to explosion-causing mistakes.</p>
      <p>“In the military, everything is more difficult when it’s summer,” an Iraqi artillery officer identified as Ali told <i>SA</i>. “And now summer never ends.”</p>
