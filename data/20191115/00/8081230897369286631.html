      <p>A boil water notice affecting approximately 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area has been lifted. </p>
      <p>The notice was blamed on heavy rain and turbidity due to suspended particles in the source water for the Leixlip water treatment plant, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/boil-water-notice-affecting-600-000-people-lifted-with-immediate-effect-1.4080555">according to the Irish Times</a>. </p>
      <p>Residents affected by the boil water notice were told to only use boiled or bottled water.</p>
      <p>“The old plant at Leixlip remains vulnerable and Irish Water working with Fingal County Council will be working to minimise the risk of another boil water notice,” <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/boil-water-notice-affecting-600-000-people-lifted-with-immediate-effect-1.4080555">said Niall Gleeson, managing director of Irish Water</a>. </p>
      <p>Monitoring, staffing and water testing will increase at the plant in order to mitigate the issue. Filters at the old plant will be replaced while still maintaining supply to Dublin.</p>
      <p>The Leixlip water treatment plant is the second largest water treatment plant in Ireland, supplying drinking water to consumers in Dublin, Kildare and Meath, which is about 33% of the Greater Dublin Area, <a href="https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/drinkingwater/drinkingwateraudits2019/Leixlip%20Water%20Treatment%20Plant%20Audit%2024.10.19.pdf">reported the EPA in a drinking water audit report</a>.</p>
      <p>“If we could, we would shut down the old plant, take it off line and do all the refurbishment at once. This is not possible because 20% of Dublin’s water supply comes from the old plant and we do not have the spare capacity to allow this to happen. We will continue to monitor the plant closely,” said Gleeson.</p>
      <p>An earlier boil water warning notice was put in place late in October after a mechanical issue at the Leixlip treatment plant raised concerns about water quality. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/drinkingwater/drinkingwateraudits2019/Leixlip%20Water%20Treatment%20Plant%20Audit%2024.10.19.pdf">The EPA has recommended</a> Irish Water install ultra violet treatment of drinking water at the Leixlip plant as a means to avoid future boil water notices. </p>
      <p>The plant has committed to spending more than €65 million upgrading and standardising disinfection systems in more than 850 public drinking water treatment plants, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/boil-water-notice-affecting-600-000-people-lifted-with-immediate-effect-1.4080555">reported the Irish Times</a>.</p>
