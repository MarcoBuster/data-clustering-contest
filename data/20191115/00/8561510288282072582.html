      <h1>Protestors Wearing Head-Mounted Cameras Scan 13,000 Faces in DC</h1>

      <h3>Scanner Darkly</h3>
      <p>Three activists with cameras mounted to their heads scanned the faces of more than 13,000 people in Washington, D.C., on Thursday as part of a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facial-recognition-protesters-scan-13000-people-2019-11">protest</a> organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future.</p>
      <p>“This should probably be illegal,” Fight for the Future’s deputy director Evan Greer said in a <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2019-11-14-now-digital-rights-activists-are-using-facial/">press release</a>, “but until Congress takes action to ban facial recognition surveillance, it’s terrifyingly easy for anyone — a government agent, a corporation, or just a creepy stalker — to conduct biometric monitoring and violate basic rights at a massive scale.”</p>
      <h3>On the Hunt</h3>
      <p>Fight for the Future <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/508186090">livestreamed</a> the protest, keeping a tally of the number of faces its hazmat suit-clad activists scanned using Amazon’s <a href="https://futurism.com/protesters-amazon-ice">controversial Rekognition software</a>.</p>
      <p>The protestors specifically targeted areas around Capitol Hill as they were hoping to identify lobbyists, journalists, and congresspeople. In the end, they managed to scan 13,740 faces — 25 of which belonged to lobbyists, seven to journalists, and one to Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier of California.</p>
      <h3>Face in the Crowd</h3>
      <p>Anyone who was in the D.C. area on Thursday can upload a photo of themselves to Fight for the Future’s <a href="https://www.scancongress.com/">Scan Congress</a> website to see if the activists scanned their face. The group will delete those photos — as well as the biometric data it collected — in two weeks.</p>
      <p>“We did this to make a point,” Greer said, before adding that “someone else could use the same technology to do unimaginable harm.”</p>
