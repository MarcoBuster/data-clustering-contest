      <p>The suit challenging the eligibility of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Kogi State, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/yahaya-bello/"><u><b>Yahaya Bello</b></u></a>, was brought before the Federal High Court, on Friday.</p>
      <p>The presiding judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo, however, stood down the case for 30 minutes in order to study a motion filed by Gov. Bello, who is seeking to be joined in the suit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://naijanews.com/"><u><b>Naija News</b></u></a> had reported that <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/14/kogi-guber-court-to-hear-suit-challenging-bellos-eligibility-on-friday/"><u><b>the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party Natasha Akpoti, is the plaintiff</b></u></a>, while the All Progressives Congress and the Independent National Electoral Commission are 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.</p>
      <p>The lawyer of the Kogi State governor, Mike Enahoro, on Friday, filed a motion of a party seeking to be joined in the matter, said he filed the application on Friday because he got the report of the case yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Counsel to the SDP candidate, Mike Ozekhome, who acknowledged receipt of the motion this morning, stated that the motion sought to stop court’s proceeding on the matter.</p>
      <p>He urged the court to throw out the motion considering that the election is Saturday.</p>
      <p>On his part, Counsel to the APC, Abdulwahab Mohammed, said he would need more time to study the motion.</p>
      <p>However, Counsel to INEC, Alhassan Umar, SAN, said he had no objection to the motion.</p>
      <p>The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday, adjourned continuation of hearing on the suit challenging whether Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi, is fit to contest in the November 16 governorship election till November 21.</p>
      <p>The presiding judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo, who adjourned the case, said the decision was to afford Gov. Bello, who sought to be joined in the matter, a fair hearing.</p>
