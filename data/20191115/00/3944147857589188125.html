      <h3>Nonprofit Receives Groundwater Donation</h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/wf/click?upn=zySGXW1QLHU8t7wSbPI8iADmwAaKTbie2jeFmcdktofrrOAL8rQtNI1usjl2Hzf2H3jSMnafr38HdbA8MXpXN31t0UAKxSs1MlVwWDIC7TM3zKlkHU7vCdVWX4MfYQB-2FiUaU0Tpyj0FwKzFbBjfGVk1unTD25PbPCSDVmqaLmPM-3D_DbtOu9KCmvm53iULifuHdMs7H7pFzXq47alfBSNuhGOUA3BEl4exL7JzyfCh9YZ-2FaCVOxnyHMyjZ3zSBU-2F4GOK83XVq08SyfRiNO-2BtQpbz7fXDN8MAGlC8wdCqisBn29Aixi8-2FPZHlvMXZUQuJRhcYZojLb9l-2BTFygOIPurXBL0EXDcNlO7guvjZpnqaZlX1GQrvqmmXwHQl7-2Fu3mF7MxISD0IqSZpWrjLF7RD0LlsBwtTy5e1vS73oWldO-2BjWWy5JsVVVjbHyi7Q00bib0UiVIs8Jsg0m42fUXmso7Fi0JHO7510nPEeP-2B-2B3lWV8wBLRBCeI2uP-2FXTKdDMqnqd6Gw-3D-3D">Water Well Trust</a>, a national nonprofit helping low income Americans get access to a clean, safe water supply, has received a $100,000 donation from the Groundwater Foundation to fund the drilling of 10 water wells in high-need, low-resource rural areas across the U.S.</p>
      <p>The Groundwater Foundation, which focuses on local groundwater education and action, merged with the National Ground Water Assn. (NGWA) in 2018.</p>
      <p>"There is a tremendous need to help families struggling to make ends meet and they shouldn't have to worry about access to clean, safe, affordable and sustainable water," said NGWA CEO Terry Morse. "I'm thrilled we are partnering with the Water Well Trust to tackle this problem; we have a lot of work to do all across America."</p>
      <h3>Revision to Standard Allows UV-LED Technology to Treat Microorganisms</h3>
      <p>An NSF Intl. drinking water treatment standard has been updated to allow a more efficient method of treating microorganisms in drinking water, <a href="http://www.nsf.org/newsroom/major-revision-drinking-water-treatment-standard-allows-uv-led-technology">according to a press release by NSF Intl</a>. The revision to NSF/ANSI 55: Ultraviolet Microbiological Water Treatment Systems establishes new criteria for use of <a href="https://www.wqpmag.com/uv-disinfection/new-uv-technology-drinking-water">UV-LED technology</a> for microbial reduction and provides a new test method to certify manufacturer claims.</p>
      <p>Treatment systems covered by the standard use ultraviolet light to inactivate or kill bacteria, viruses and cysts in microbiologically unsafe water (Class A systems) or to reduce the amount of non-disease-causing bacteria in disinfected drinking water (Class B systems).</p>
      <p>“This is a significant update to the drinking water treatment standard. While non-disinfecting LEDs are found in everyday applications such as lighting fixtures and consumer electronics, this use of ultraviolet LED technology is very different. Lab testing shows that UV-LED technology is effective at reducing bacteria and other types of microorganisms in drinking water,” <a href="http://www.nsf.org/">said Jessica Evans, Director of Standards Development at NSF Intl</a>.</p>
