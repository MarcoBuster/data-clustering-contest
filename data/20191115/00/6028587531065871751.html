      <p>While diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) themes have taken on a greater mind share across many industries, retail, in particular, has been under a microscope in recent months. In the land of brands, diversity not only comprises who is working at a company but also the products it sells. It’s no longer enough to check a box and simply offer extended sizes. Retailers now must encompass the cultures brands serve, the decision-makers they hire and the processes in place for taking their products to market. In past <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/#5dd3ecb63584">Forbes</a> articles, I have discussed how the countless missteps over the last year have come back to bite retailers and brands that have been slow to implement diversity and inclusivity protocols — and who arguably could have avoided the costly launch of offensive products if they had a more diverse workforce and leadership that was more in-line with the consumers who purchase their goods, and if they had customer-tested these products before launch.Recently, we announced the results of a <a href="https://www.firstinsight.com/white-papers-posts/the-state-of-consumer-spending-gender-disconnects">survey</a> that points to differences between U.S. men and women versus U.K. men and women when it comes to expectations for diversity and inclusion, and how retailers should respond following the launch of an offensive product.</p>
      <p>We found that while men and women are largely aligned in the U.S. on diversity and inclusion issues, women in the U.K. rank these factors as less important than do U.S. shoppers and even their U.K. male counterparts in the majority of cases.</p>
      <p>This is an interesting finding, as awareness of D&amp;I issues appear to be growing in the U.K. and on-par with the U.S. A recent <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-work-diversity-lgbt-gender-pay-gap-uk-workers-companies-a8733071.html">article</a> in The Independent showed that, based on a survey of 2,000 UK employees, workers who do not believe their company is committed to diversity are three times more likely to leave their job in the next three years than those who do.</p>
      <p>Yet take, for example, the perceived importance of having women in leadership roles, compared between genders and between the U.S. and U.K.. In the U.S., about half of both men and women surveyed consider having women and minorities in leadership positions as important and feel it would benefit retailers and brands to hire Chief Diversity Officers. Conversely, only 39 percent of women in the U.K. stated that having women and minorities in leadership positions was important, compared to 43 percent of men. Further, more than half of U.K. male respondents (55 percent) felt that retailers would benefit from hiring a Chief Diversity Officer, versus only 48 percent of women in the U.K who felt the same way.</p>
      <p>U.K. women lagging behind the U.S. may be reflective of the country’s slower pace in implementing diversity initiatives within U.K. companies. In June of this year, the Financial Times ran a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11daa4f0-86b2-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2">piece</a> which reinforced that diversity and inclusion should not just be a compliance issue, but a cultural one. The piece pointed out that in the U.K. the lack of representation of black and minority ethnic executives in retail is extreme. Just one percent of executive committee members at the 10 biggest U.K. retailers are non-white and only five percent of board members are, compared to almost a fifth of executive committee members coming from black and minority ethnic backgrounds in the U.S.</p>
      <p>According to our study, just under half of U.S. men and women (48 percent and 45 percent, respectively) ranked cultural inclusivity important, compared to 44 percent of men and only 36 percent of women in the U.K. And 44 percent of both genders in the U.S. responded that influencers that represent diverse points of view are important. In the U.K., only 35 percent of women felt the same way compared to 44 percent of men.</p>
      <p>This may be due to the fact that the U.S. is more culturally diverse than the U.K. A Brookings Institute <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/americans-and-britons-key-population-data-from-the-last-three-u-s-and-u-k-censuses/">study</a> found that “Americans are significantly more racially and ethnically diverse than Britons, and a greater proportion of them was born in other countries... Higher proportions of foreign-born residents in the United States reflect higher recent immigration rates.”</p>
      <p>That said, the one place that U.K. women seem to be matched with others is in the area of inclusive sizing. Sixty-seven percent of women in the U.S. and 63 percent of women in the U.K. ranked inclusive sizing as important. Fifty-four percent of U.S. men and 56 percent of U.K. men felt the same.</p>
      <p>This is likely due to the growth of inclusive sizing in the U.K. In 2016 the plus size clothing market in the U.K. was worth approximately 6.44 billion British pounds. This value is expected to increase to around 9.03 billion British pounds by 2022, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/829734/plus-size-clothing-market-size-united-kingdom-uk/">recent U.K. data by Statista</a>. In the U.S. in 2015, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/820609/plus-size-women-s-apparel-market-value-forecast-us/">market was valued at 20 billion U.S. dollars</a>, and is projected to grow to 24 billion dollars by 2020 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/820609/plus-size-women-s-apparel-market-value-forecast-us/">according to data by Statista</a>.</p>
      <p>While there is a disparity between men and women in the U.K. on the importance of D&amp;I initiatives, men and women on both sides of the pond agreed on what a retailer or brand should do following the launch of an offensive product. </p>
      <p>Women in both the U.S. (55 percent) and the U.K. (58 percent) noted that they would stop shopping at that retailer or brand temporarily, compared to men in the U.S. (42 percent) and the U.K. (47 percent). Further, 83 percent of women and 77 percent of men in the U.S. felt that an immediate apology was important, in line with the U.K., with 86 percent of women and 74 percent of men responding an apology was important.</p>
      <p>The majority of respondents in the U.S. (71 percent of women and 64 percent of men) and U.K. (76 percent or women and 63 percent of men) also felt that retailers and brands needed to establish a track record with no offensive items for six or more months before they would purchase from them again.</p>
      <p>In a world where there exists the potential for both brands and retailers to get it wrong more than ever before, Caroline Rush, CEO of British Fashion Council, said it best when discussing the topic with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/why-luxury-fashion-is-now-a-democracy">GQ</a> Britain: “Customers are hyper-sensitive to brands that don’t match their values,” said Rush. “And they can often be turned off by a single activation or campaign that gets it wrong.” She also noted that “while a product might be exclusive, experiences, communications and campaigns need to be much more inclusive.”</p>
      <p>While it appears U.K. women have been slower to find weight in D&amp;I issues, the fact that they plan to hold retailers and brands accountable for missteps signifies the gap may be very short-lived. Retailers and brands need to be not only connecting with the voice of their customers to better understand expectations when it comes to D&amp;I at the company level but also on the product level. As D&amp;I programs move from a nice-to-have to a must-have at an epic pace, the window for retailers and brands is closing. Act now.</p>
