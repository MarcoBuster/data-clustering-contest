      <p>Lazaro had a feeling things would go his and Brazil’s way at the Estadio Bezerrao in Brasilia (Gama) on Thursday night. With the hosts trailing France 2-0 at half-time in their <b><a href="https://www.fifa.com/u17worldcup/">FIFA U-17 World Cup Brazil 2019™</a></b> semi-final, the substitute calmed his team-mates down in the dressing room and told them not to give up hope. He also had a premonition he would have a part to play in the game’s outcome.</p>
      <p>“Guilherme [Brazil coach Guilherme Dalla Dea] spoke to me at the interval and told me to relax because I’d be coming on,” Lazaro told <b>FIFA.com</b> after <b><a href="https://www.fifa.com/u17worldcup/news/scintillating-comeback-secures-brazil-berth-in-final#france-v-brazil-fifa-u-17-world-cup-brazil-2019-x2429">his side had stunned the French with a 3-2 comeback win</a></b>. “That was when I got it into my head that I’d win the game. I was so confident I’d get the goal.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I spoke to everyone at half-time and told them we just needed to stay calm and that we could come back. And that’s what happened: we kept our calm.”</p>
      <p>The Flamengo forward came on in the 71st minute, with Kaio Jorge having already pulled a goal back to make it 2-1 and Gabriel Veron scoring the equaliser shortly after Lazaro’s arrival. The moment the sub had been waiting for came with a minute of normal time remaining. Latching on to a long ball from goalkeeper Matheus Donelli, Lazaro scampered into the box, cut inside a French defender and thumped a low drive just inside Melvin Zinga’s right-hand post. His premonition had become reality.</p>

      <h3>Last-minute call-up</h3>
      <p>Absent from the Brazil squad when it was first announced, Lazaro was only added to the list when Juan picked up an injury.</p>
      <p>“I was pretty calm on the day the announcement was made,” explained Brazil’s hero of the hour. “When Juan got injured I sent him a message telling him to stay calm. He’s a great kid. When I heard the news that I was in the squad, I was relaxed because I knew I wouldn’t be playing.”</p>
      <p>The No20 has had to bide his time. Prior to Thursday’s semi-final, he had spent only 30 minutes on the pitch, coming on as a sub against Angola in Brazil’s final group match.</p>
      <p>Now, with his newly found status of talisman, Lazaro can dream of a place in the starting line-up for Sunday’s final against Mexico at the Estadio Bezerrao. There is no question of him getting carried away, however.</p>
      <p>“I’ll leave that to Guilherme because he knows how to pick a team,” said the frontman, speaking with the same blend of coolness and self-confidence that gave the hosts victory over France. “I try not to think about things like that. I just play my football. Everyone who knows me knows that I’m a very laid-back kid.”</p>
