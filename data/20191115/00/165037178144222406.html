        <b>Hungary made a losing start to life at their new Puskas Arena as Edinson Cavani was on target in a 2-1 Uruguay win.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Edinson Cavani and Brian Rodriguez</b> were on target as <b>Uruguay ran out 2-1 winners</b> against a Hungary side celebrating the opening of the new Puskas Arena.</p>
      <p>The 68,000-seat state-funded stadium hosted its first match in front of a <b>packed-out crowd in Budapest</b>.</p>
      <p>Those in attendance were treated to a barnstorming opening to the friendly as all three goals arrived inside 25 minutes, with Cavani and Rodriguez <b>putting the visitors in command</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Adam Szalai</b> scored the first Hungary goal at the ground to halve the deficit but it was a lead they were unable to turn around.</p>

      <p>Uruguay were ahead after 15 minutes when <b>Matias Vina's excellent left-wing centre</b> was turned in at the far post by <b>Cavani</b>.</p>
      <p>Luis Suarez then teed up Rodriguez, who jinked inside on the left of the box and bent a <b>sublime effort into the far corner.</b></p>
      <p>Hungary reduced the arrears when Szalai coolly slotted home Roland Varga's cut-back with his left foot.</p>
      <p>Substitute Maxi Gomez had the opportunity to restore the two-goal cushion when <b>slipped in by Cavani in the 64th minute</b>, only for Botond Barath to make a superb recovery block.</p>
      <p>Cristhian Stuani almost bundled his way through in the closing stages, but Denes Dibusz stood up well to his close-range effort.</p>
