      <p>Cathay Pacific is upgrading its first class and business class travel experience by partnering with the luxury UK lifestyle brand Bamford to roll out a range of amenities, travel kits and bedding in the premium cabins.</p>
      <p>
        <b>First class</b>
      </p>
      <p>First class passengers will first see a welcome reception tray when they enter the cabin. The tray will include a personalised welcome note along with a hot towel and a glass of sparkling jasmine silver needle tea provided by the UK-based tea brand Jing.</p>

      <p>The airline said the in-flight menu will incorporate wellness as a “core pillar” of the first class dining experience along with new recipes, which range from lighter options for the main and breakfast meals to healthy alternatives such as superfood bowls and lighter protein side dishes. Cold-pressed juices from local juice company Bless, which feature “metabolism-stimulating ingredients”, and teas from Jing are also offered before breakfast.</p>
      <p>The dishes will be served on new tableware, which includes chinaware from Nagoya-based Noritake, cutlery from British brand Robert Welch and full-size wine glasses from Austria-based glassware manufacturer Riedel.</p>

      <p>Bedding amenities in the first class include products from Bamford such as a 600-thread-count, “100 per cent sustainably sourced” cotton mattress and duvet, a soft full-size pillow, and branded male and female amenity kits with natural skincare products presented in glass bottles.</p>
      <p>Bamford’s products can also be found in the onboard washrooms and at select lounges around the world. The brand’s Botanic Pillow Mist will be “a key feature” of Cathay Pacific’s new turndown service, where a cabin attendant will offer to help passengers convert their reclining seat to a flat bed, decked out with covers, duvets, and soft pillows.</p>
