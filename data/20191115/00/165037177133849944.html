      <h1>Welsh FA outraged as UEFA translator asks "Who is Gareth Bale?"</h1>

        <b>Trouble at the Welsh national team press conference before the clash with Azerbaijan. A person hired by UEFA to translate the words of Ryan Giggs into Azeri was not very aware of who were the Welsh national team players... not even Gareth Bale!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pre-<b>Azerbaijan-Wales</b> press conference in Baku was surprising, to say the least. Not only did Gareth Bale leave Real Madrid fans speechless by saying<b> <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/new/i-m-more-excited-about-playing-for-wales-than-real-madrid-745206">he preferred to play for his country than in white</a></b>, but there was also much more.</p>
      <p>During Wales coach Ryan Giggs' turn, things did not get off to a good start. The translator kept talking as the legendary ex-player tried to answer questions and things went from bad to worse when the translator, hired by UEFA for the event, asked the coach about his big star.</p>
      <p>"<b>Who's Gareth Bale?</b>," the translator whispered to a <b>visibly frustrated Ryan Giggs</b>, who finished the press conference as best he could all while looking very angry.Â </p>

      <p>After the team's coach appeared, the Welsh Federation asked UEFA to replace the translator... and did so when the Real Madrid player was <b>already answering questions</b>.</p>
      <p>The surrealism was such that <b>even Bale</b>, always so measured, dedicated a few words to her: "<b>You're a little late</b>".</p>
      <p>Curiously, this is not the only mess at a Welsh press conference. In Cardiff's clash with Croatia, the Croatian to English translator disappointed and even<b> the Croatian Federation ended up firing him live.</b></p>
