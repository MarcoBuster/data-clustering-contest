      <p>Her "Triggered (freestyle)" made fans think that Jhené Aiko was spilling out her heart over her break-up with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/BigSean/profile">Big Sean</a>. The song was so emotional that the rapper faced backlash on social media from those who accused him of all sorts of unverified accusations, <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jhene-aiko-clears-the-air-about-big-sean-triggered-is-not-a-diss-song-news.79612.html">causing Jhené to come forward in her ex's defense.</a></p>
      <p>The former couple have maintained one of the healthiest ex-relationship friendships as they continue to spend time and collaborate with one another. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/big-sean-reflects-on-the-solo-life-on-his-track-single-again-new-song.1983901.html">Jhené recently popped up on Sean's single "Single Again"</a> where he discussed the need to remove romance from his life in order to work on himself. In a sort of response, or at least the perspective of the other person involved, Jhené has released "None of Your Concern" where she shares how she's feeling about the break-up. Sean comes in near the end of the track to spit a few bars on how he can't stop thinking about her, further confusing the public about what's truly going on with these two. Give it a listen and let us know what you think.</p>

      </p>
      <p>I've been contemplating, meditating<br/>Should have waited, should have never dated<br/>You seem irritated<br/>Baby, why you never say it<br/>Isn't this worth saving<br/>I can feel you fading</p>
