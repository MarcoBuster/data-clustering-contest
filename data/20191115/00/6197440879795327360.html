      <h1>Google breaks down how to use the Stadia Controller [Gallery]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:17:59+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>With Stadia launching in a <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/15/google-stadia-launching/">matter of days</a>, Google has been detailing the more granular aspects of how to actually use the game streaming service. Yesterday’s AMA provided an overview of the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/13/google-stadia-interface/">Android, iOS, and TV interface</a>, while Google today is <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9565956?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9495415">breaking down</a> the Stadia Controller.</p>
      <p>New diagrams identify every part and button on the Made by Google accessory. All controllers have console-specific actions, with Stadia’s ellipsis button for “Options” and the hamburger icon opening “Menu.” Pressing down on both for 5 seconds activates Stadia’s Chromecast screen reader.</p>
      <p>There’s of course the “Google Assistant” and “Capture” button below. The former does not need to be held down while you issue a voice command, while a tap on the latter saves a screenshot and holding down creates a clip.</p>
      <p>The Stadia icon between the two thumbstucks serves as a button and “Status Light.” To turn on the platform, you hold down for a second until the controller vibrates. Off is achieved by pressing for 4 seconds, while 8 is a “hard power down” in case the accessory become unresponsive.</p>
      <p>A quick tap of the button opens the “Stadia menu” for: See your profile information, Check your Wi-Fi connection status, Adjust audio levels, Start a party, View notifications, or Exit game.</p>

      <p>Holding it down for 1 second lets you access the “platform menu” to: Resume game, Turn the controller off, Exit game, Sign out, or Shut down.</p>
      <p>The light has several states with “Solid white” meaning that the Controller is on and linked to a screen. “Blinking white” means the device is awaiting a linking code, while “Blinking orange” means Wi-Fi is required and to open the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/08/google-stadia-app-play-store-download/">Stadia</a> <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/12/google-stadia-iphone-app/">app</a>. The light stays “Solid orange” during charging and will turn off once complete. When Assistant is active, the light will “blink in a series of two short flashes followed by a pause.”</p>
      <p>Besides standard bumpers, triggers, directional pad, and A/B/X/Y buttons, Google identifies the left and right vibration motors housed in the grips and microphone just underneath the 3.5mm headset jack — <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/07/18/stadia-controller-bluetooth-audio/">Bluetooth audio support</a> is coming later. A USB-C port is up top for <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/18/stadia-controller-wireless-launch/">wired gameplay</a> and charging, but Google has yet to provide any official battery life estimates.</p>
