      <p><i>Hired to trim overhanging branches in the school campus, they stole Sandalwood trees later</i> <br/><br/>Imdadulla A and Mujahidulla were hired by Bishop Cotton Girls High School on St Marks Road to cut overhanging branches of trees in the campus. The two made very good use of it and had the opportunity to survey the place. They stumbled upon sandlwood trees which were later stolen with the help of dozen others. There are now 18 accused in the case. <br/><br/>They have been booked under the Indian Penal Code and the Karnataka Forest Act. In May 2018, they “were entrusted with the work of cutting the hanging branches of trees in the Bishop Cotton Girls High School. While cutting the branches of tree, the accused found some sandalwood trees in the said school and thereafter, they cut and removed sandalwood trees into pieces,” it was alleged. They are said to have sold it to three persons. The three then sold it to two others. The police recovered the sandalwood from these persons and one another. <br/><br/>The police also alleged that there were two main accused (accused No.1 and No.2) at whose instance Imdadulla and Mujahidulla stole the trees. The High Court which heard their plea for bail said that doubt arises due to this. “During the course of investigation, the conspiracy between all the accused has to be proved in order to establish that what is connection between accused Nos.1 and 2 and at the instance of whom, the said sandalwood trees were cut and removed. Therefore, under the above stated circumstances, the doubt arises when there is no direct participation of these petitioners in cutting and removing sandalwood trees from the said place,” the court said. <br/><br/>Therefore Section 104(d) of Karnataka Forest Act is not applicable, the court said. This section does not allow bail on personal bond. One of the main accused has already been released on bail. So these two who could have done the stealing under their guidance deserved bail. “The petitioners also stand on the same footing as that of accused No.2. Therefore, petitioners are entitled to the enlarged on bail on the ground of parity. <br/><br/>The two were ordered to be released on bail after they execute a personal bond of Rs 50,000 each and one surety for the like-sum. Imposing some conditions on them, the court said, “The petitioners shall not indulge in tampering the prosecution witnesses. The petitioners shall appear before the jurisdictional court on all the future hearing dates unless exempted by the court for any genuine cause. The petitioners shall not leave the jurisdiction of the trial Court without prior permission of the court till the case registered against them is disposed of.”</p>
