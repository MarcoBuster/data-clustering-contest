        <b>This week the biggest names in the world of football travel with their respective teams to represent their country. However, there are top-level players who stayed at home.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wearing your national team's shirt is one of the <b>greatest honors in a football career</b>. However, there are certain players who are practically banned from playing for their country.</p>
      <p><b>Karim Benzema</b> is one of the players who can't get back into the national team jersey. After the '<b>Valbuena case', the Real Madrid striker was banned </b>and has not played with 'Les Bleus' again.</p>
      <p>But Benzema is not the only top-level striker outside France. Deschamps has also left out <b>Alexander Lacazette</b> this EURO qualifying phase.</p>

      <p>In Argentina, the big absentee is Mauro Icardi. The Inter Milan striker, on loan from PSG, played his last game for "La Albiceleste" in November 2018, just a year ago.</p>
      <p>Brazil, who took on Argentina on Friday, also left big names at home. This is the case of a <b>Marcelo </b>who is just recovering. Also <b>David Luiz</b>, who has not played with 'Canarinha' since 2017.</p>
      <p>Two players from Atlético de Madrid also stayed at home. This is <b>Diego Costa</b>, injured after the last match, and <b>Koke</b>, the Atletico captain and who seems to have been discarded from palying with Spain. </p>
