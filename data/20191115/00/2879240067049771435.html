      <p>The Expedition 61 crew is about to kick off a series of complex spacewalks on Friday to repair the International Space Station's cosmic particle detector. They had one more spacewalk review Thursday while continuing advanced biology research.</p>
      <p>Spacewalkers Luca Parmitano and Andrew Morgan readied the Quest airlock, their U.S. spacesuits and tools for Friday's excursion set to begin at 7:05 a.m. EST. The duo then joined Flight Engineers Jessica Meir and Christina Koch for a final procedures review. All four astronauts called down to Mission Control to discuss their readiness with spacewalk experts on the ground. Live NASA TV coverage begins at 5:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>Meir and Koch spent the rest of Thursday on space research and lab upkeep. Meir conducted a test run of a 3-D bioprinter before the device will manufacture complex human organ tissue shapes. Koch measured airflow in the station then serviced microbe samples to extract and sequence their DNA.</p>
      <p>Cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Skripochka focused on their complement of science and maintenance in the station's Russian segment. Skvortsov updated cargo inventory and explored plasma physics for insights into advanced spacecraft designs. Skripochka collected radiation readings and studied how a crew adapts to piloting in space.</p>
