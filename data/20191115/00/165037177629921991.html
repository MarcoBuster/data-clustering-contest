        <b>In an interview with 'Radio Capital', Zaniolo's mum has once again given her opinion on sexist chanting and has compared them to racist chanting which has been seen recently in the stadiums.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zaniolo's mother<b> has been insulted in some stadiums</b>. In a match between Parma and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/roma">Roma</a>, some supporters chanted <b>"Zaniolo's mum is a b***h.</b>"</p>
      <p>On social media, where she is very popular, Francesca Costa has given her opinion on people who usre this type of sexist language. <b>She has analysed the situation more in depth i</b>n a radio interview. </p>
      <p>"I hear sexist insults in the same way as racist chanting. <b>There are sexist insults which are the same as racial discrimination</b>. The majority of those responsible are adult men in the stadium, but those that do it on social media are 14 or 15. <b>The teenagers are the ones who write the worst things</b>," she said. </p>

      <p>"Is the footballing world sexist? The fact many men say that women don't know about football <b>means they consider women as second class.</b>.," Zaniolo concluded. </p>
