      <p>SANTA CLARITA  (INT)  Authorities investigating the Saugus High School shootings may never know what caused a 16-year-old boy to bring a 45-calibre gun to school. <br/><br/>Nathaniel Berhow, who saved the last bullet for himself, died Friday afternoon of his self-inflicted head wound, the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department said. Berhow had been in grave condition since Thursdays incident. <br/><br/>Investigators are digging into the Berhows social media and background. He lived with his mother, who was with him when he died. The incident occurred on the suspects 16th birthday. <br/><br/>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the Thursday morning attack appeared to have been planned, but "It still remains a mystery why. It was deliberate." <br/>The suspect had been dropped off at school by his mother, the sheriff said. He was standing by himself, walked to the quad area, dropped his backpack and started firing, striking random targets, Villanueva said. <br/><br/>The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner identified the dead students as Gracie Muehlberger, 16, and Dominic Blackwell, 14. <br/><br/>One wounded victim was released from the hospital Thursday night, while a 14-year-old girl and 15-year-old girl who were shot remained hospitalized Friday but were expected to be released in coming days.</p>
