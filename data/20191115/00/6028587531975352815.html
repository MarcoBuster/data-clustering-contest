      <p>BT Sport has reportedly retained its UEFA Champions League coverage across the United Kingdom for the next round of broadcast rights, season 2020/21 to 2023/24.It is a deal that is thought to be in the region of $1.5 billion (£1.2 billion), matching the figure last paid for by the broadcaster in the previous four-season rights package.</p>
      <p>The bumper agreement is exceptionally good news for European football's governing body, UEFA.</p>
      <p>Thursday's information comes hot off the back of last week's announcement that CBS and Univision will pay a combined $140 million (€127 million) for Champions League rights across America in a three-year deal from season 2020/21.</p>
      <p>The new US joint venture is said to be $100 million more than is currently paid by Turner and Univision.</p>

      <p>BT Sport's winning tenure has been reported across Associated Press newswires, with the company said to have beat off competition from Free to Air broadcaster, ITV, along with a bid from Sky Sports - now part of the telecommunications conglomerate, Comcast.</p>
      <p>The deal will come as a surprise to those inside UEFA. Marketing and rights experts were predicting a drop off in income, after a decline in the United Kingdom sports pay market.</p>
      <p>The Premier League saw a sharp decline in funds raised from the sale of broadcast rights in the home territory.</p>
      <p>BT and Sky Sports paid a total of $5.6 billion (£4.4 billion) to screen 200 games each season between 2019-2022.</p>
      <p>It was an amount that fell way short of the $6.5 billion (£5.1 billion) the Premier League received for the previous round of four-year rights sales.</p>
      <p>BT Sport's Champions League coverage has seen a sharp increase in its subscription base. A 2018-19 <a href="https://www.btplc.com/Sharesandperformance/Financialreportingandnews/Quarterlyresults/2018-2019/Consumerbusinessbriefing/Downloads/Slides/ConsumerBusinessBriefingpresentationMay2018.pdf">report citied</a> a year-on-year growth of 19 percent across traditional television subscriptions with a 40 percent increase of the company's web apps and online reach.</p>

      <p>The growth in part has been fuelled by better representation in the competition by home clubs. Liverpool reached their first Champions League Final in 11 years when they took on Real Madrid in Kyiv in 2018.</p>
      <p>Just 12 months later Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur in the first all english final, something that BT chief executive, Philip Jansen, described as 'Champions League fever' with an increase in subscribers prior to the fixture in June, 2019.</p>
      <p>It was a matchup that saw a marked rise in viewing figures of the showpiece event. BT estimated that 11.3 million viewers saw the Liverpool vs Tottenham final, an increase of a third on the previous season's figure of 8.5 million.</p>
      <p>The coverage from BT Sport has received numerous plaudits since they acquired the UEFA rights.</p>
      <p>Free Champions League Final broadcasts on YouTube has drawn praise as well as <a href="https://tbivision.com/video/content-innovation-awards-2019/">accolades</a> for to its 'No Filter' series, also available via the American video-sharing platform.</p>
      <p>Figures from YouTube show the two 2019 semi-final matches that included Liverpool and Tottenham drew serious levels of interaction when adapted to the highly popular No Filter series.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s dramatic comeback against Barcelona at the semi-final stage saw a peak of 1.2 million hits on the platform.</p>
      <p>While Tottenham’s similarly wonderful fightback in Amsterdam, against Ajax, spiked at 1.3 million views.</p>
      <p>With no official response as yet from either BT Sport or UEFA to the Press Association newswires report, it can now only be a matter of days before the deal is announced formally.</p>
