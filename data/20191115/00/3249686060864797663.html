      <p>According to <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/park-ha-sun">Park Ha Sun</a>'s label <b>Key East</b> on November 14, the actress's younger brother recently passed away this week, due to a heart attack. </p>
      <p>His funeral procession took place on November 14, with Park Ha Sun, her husband <b>Ryu Soo Young</b>, as well as various family and friends present. </p>
