      <h1>SpecFix: Is this the dawn of a new era for Indian geeks and otakus?</h1>

      <p><i>By TG Shenoy</i> <br/><br/>If you’d told me a couple of years ago that SF/F geeks of Bengaluru would get to meet and mingle with some of their favourite Indian SF authors and legends from the world of science fiction, I’d have laughed at you. Today, I’m no longer laughing. Because in just the past year alone we’ve been fortunate enough – thanks to the Bangalore Literature Festival’s decision to include SF events – to meet with and listen to authors such as Bruce Sterling, Samit Basu, Krishna Udayasankar last year and this previous weekend to hear British author Ian McDonald, Sri Lankan SF writers Yudhanjaya Wijeratne and Navin Weeraratne and Indian authors such as Sukanya Venkatraghavan, Indrapramit Das, Sadhna Shanker and Vinayak Varma taking about science, science fiction, futures and more. <br/><br/><br/>As somewhat of an otaku – a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, especially anime – I’d have similarly laughed if you’d said that I’d be watching an anime film on the big screen. I’m no longer laughing. For you see, us Indian anime fans are accustomed to looking for alternative sources, given the popular tastes of Indian movie-going audiences which don’t allow space for screens to show anime. I was reconciled to watching the latest movie – the follow up to the highest grossing anime film of all time, Your Name (Kimi no Na wa) – from a Japanese director I quite like, Makoto Shinkai, on my PC. But it wasn’t to be. <br/><br/>Earlier this year, an online campaign was begun by a group called the Indian Anime Movement to bring anime movies to India, including Shinkai’s Weathering With You, since nominated as Japan’s entry to the Oscars under the Best International Feature Film category. There was a petition on Change.org as well, started by Divishth Pancholi. The petition, titled, ‘Prasoon Joshi: Weathering With You (Tenki no Ko) screening in India’, was addressed to Makoto Shinkai, PVR and Toho read, “Weathering with you, or tenki no ko is a new Makoto Shinkai film, that will have a worldwide release. Makoto Shinkai beat the “most grossing anime film” and it’s clear that his works are beautiful. There is a handful of community in India that enjoys watching anime films and shows and with that comes the question of piracy. We all want to be patriots and stop this by legally watching the film.” With 56,337 signatories, this petition made all the difference and so in October, ‘Weathering With You’ was released in India through the PVR-backed Vkaao. Quite the milestone, for this was the first time an anime film had a widespread theatrical release in India. <br/><br/><br/>Weathering With You is a lush, gorgeously visualised film that blends science fiction, fantasy and romance with a clear climate change message told through the tale of two friends: a runaway boy looking to make a life in Tokyo and a girl whose prayers seem to the only way to stop the rain and get some respite from the incessant downpour. As much as it was about the movie, it was also the experience of watching an anime movie on the big screen for the first time, in a theatre packed with anime buffs. In fact, the movie began with a message that read, ‘Thanks to all the Indian otakus who made this happen’. It was a glorious moment to be with fellow fans when the characters from Shinkai’s previous film, Your Name made an appearance in ‘Weathering With You’ and there were roars and cheers all around the theatre when this not-so-subtle Easter egg was spotted. From what I have seen, ‘Weathering With You’ has run to packed halls across the country. This, I’m hoping, will spur further releases of anime movies in India so that when we look back on this year, we’ll recognise it for being the dawn of a new era for Indian fans of SF and anime.</p>
