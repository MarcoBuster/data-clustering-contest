      <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lacie-hull/">Lacie</a> is a big part of our defense,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> said. “It was fun to see her get going. She had a great game. The team came out and worked hard.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> dominated most every category, though <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> was quick to point out a need for more offensive rebounds, even though the Cardinal had an 18-2 advantage in second-chance points.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Fran Belibi added eight points and 13 rebounds, including a team-high three on the offensive boards.</p>
      <p>“Fran had a solid game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> said. “The freshmen are getting a lot of help from the upper classmen.”</p>
      <p>Freshman Jasmine Gayles scored eight points to lead the Bears (0-3), who fell to 14-26 against the Pac-12. Freshman Kadie Deaton added seven points and Alisha Davis had seven rebounds.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lacie-hull/">Hull</a> made her first five shots and finished 8 of 11. She also had five rebounds and matched <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/haley-jones/">Jones</a> with a team-best three assists.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“I was relaxed and ready to play,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lacie-hull/">Hull</a> said. “Really I didn’t know how I was doing until afterward.”</p>
        <p>The Cardinal scored 90 or more points in three straight games for the first time in nearly 18 years, last recording the feat in January of 2002.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> shot 50% or better in every quarter, finishing 54.4%.</p>
        <p>The Cardinal took a 72-33 advantage into the fourth quarter and then held the Bears to 1 of 14 from the field.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> scored the game’s first nine points and it never got better for the Bears, who were 2 of 11 in the second quarter and under 25% at the half.</p>
        <p>The Cardinal also went on a 14-0 run in the second quarter, producing a 48-17 advantage.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> led at halftime, 47-22.</p>
        <p>INJURY REPORT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> freshman Hannah Jump was relegated to street clothes against the Bears because of a broken nose suffered in practice. She could have played with a mask, the same one Alyssa Jerome used when she broke her nose, but the Cardinal were being cautious. Jump will likely return for Sunday’s game against Gonzaga.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Northern Colorado: Alexis Chapman will likely hold the key to the Bears offensive success. She’s the top returning scorer and had 38 points through the first two games, anchoring a starting five that includes two freshmen. Chapman was 0 of 3 from the field in the first and then hit a 3-pointer on her first attempt of the second half. She finished 1-of-12.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a>: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/haley-jones/">Jones</a>, the nation’s top recruit, got her first start and became the third freshman to earn a start for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a>, who continues to experiment with different combinations. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/haley-jones/">Jones</a> scored 11 points on 4-of-7 shooting and delivered a perfect pass to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lacie-hull/">Lacie Hull</a> for an assist. “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/haley-jones/">Haley</a> looks good in transition and helps us push the ball,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> said. “She can also post up and she understands the pace we want to play. She’ll just keep getting better and better.”</p>
