      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Two rideshare companies are urging Ohio to resume requiring front license plates.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lyft/">Lyft</a> submitted letters Thursday to Republican Senate President Larry Obhof (AWB’-hawf) in support of legislation that would again make it mandatory for Ohio drivers to affix license plates to both the front and back of their vehicles.</p>
      <p>The companies cite safety concerns. Both urge their riders to confirm the license plate number on a phone app before entering a rideshare vehicle. A 21-year-old University of South Carolina student was murdered earlier this year by the driver of a car she mistakenly thought was an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> vehicle.</p>
