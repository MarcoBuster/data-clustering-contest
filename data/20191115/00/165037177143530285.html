        <b>Real Madrid are still interesting in Donny van de Beek and there are now rumours of 'Los Blancos' sealing his transfer in January so that he arrives in the summer.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a><b> are not a team known for making big movements</b> in the January transfer window although this time <b>it does look like they are planning to move</b> and get everything sorted as soon as possible. </p>
      <p>One of these would be <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/d-van-de-beek-255119/">Donny Van de Beek's</a> signing, according to the Italian media outlet 'CalcioMercato'. <b>Real Madrid</b> <b>are still interested in the Dutchman </b>and are pretending to emulate Barcelona. </p>
      <p>The Catalans completed <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/f-de-jong-279661/">Frenkie de Jong's </a>deal announcing an agreement in the winter months, <b>even though the Ajax player did not move to</b> <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a> until the summer. </p>

      <p>This same system is the one which Real want to do this time.<b> They would seal the deal before the rest of their competitors </b>have time to do so.</p>
      <p><b>Real Madrid really like him because of his versatility </b>in the whole of midfield.</p>
      <p>But, as 'CalcioMercato' have said, <b>these qualities have also caught the attention of other clubs </b>like Inter and Juve. However, <b>Real Madrid seem to have hit the front </b>and January will be key. </p>
