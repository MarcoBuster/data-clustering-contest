      <h1>Chelsea Centre-Back, Fikayo Tomori, Still Eligible</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>There had been controversy over the eligibility of Fikayo Tomori who was giving birth to in Canada by Nigerian parents and now lives in England.</p>
      <p>Recall that England had overlooked the 21-year-old during their two Euro 2020 qualifying matches against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria last month after he was invited.</p>
      <p>He was also dropped during England’s Euro 2020 qualifying victory against Montenegro on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Recall that <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/09/chelsea-star-reveals-why-he-chose-england-over-nigeria/"><u><b>he was invited alongside his Chelsea teammate, Tammy Abraham</b></u></a>, and the centre-back was an unused substitute in the game against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Tomori would have become cap-tied like Abraham if he had been summoned from the bench against the visitors.</p>
      <p>England manager, Gareth Southgate opted for Joe Gomez, James Maddison and Tammy Abraham, as the Three Lions thrashed Montenegro 7-0 at Wembley Stadium to book their spots at next year’s European Championships.</p>
