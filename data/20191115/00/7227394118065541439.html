      <h1>Redmi K30 with 5G support confirmed for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=30" target="_blank">Ricky</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_k30_will_bring_5g_connectivity_and_punch_hole_display-news-39609.php">Last month</a>, we heard that a Redmi K30 device would come with 5G support and a hole-punch selfie camera in the display. About a month later, and Xiaomi has confirmed the timeframe for the K30 smartphone.</p>

      <p>The news was shared by Lu Weibing, Vice President of Xiaomi Group, via Weibo. Following a post about the China Mobile Worldwide Partner Conference and Redmi’s brief history with the partner, Weibing ended with “2020, Redmi 5G is a pioneer. K30 see!” – roughly translated from Chinese.</p>
      <p>Along with the post was a small chart showing the Redmi device amongst its competitors in China.</p>

      <p>The Redmi K30 is expected to come with dual 5G standby support with a Qualcomm 7250 chipset that would allow the feature. It’s also expected to have dual-selfie cameras that punch out of the display, kind of like the S10+. Not much else is known about the K30, but we’ll surely find out as its launch in China approaches next year.</p>
