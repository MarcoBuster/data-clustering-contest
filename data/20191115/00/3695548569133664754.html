        <b>Valentino Rossi has called his ex-Yamaha team-mate Jorge Lorenzo "one of the greatest rivals of my career" following the triple MotoGP champion's retirement announcement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lorenzo called time on his glittering grand prix career on Thursday afternoon at Valencia in a special press conference.</p>
      <p>Rossi spent seven years as team-mate to Lorenzo, with the pair engaging in a heated rivalry in their two stints together on the factory YZR-M1s.</p>
      <p>Such was the intensity of their rivalry that Rossi ordered a wall to be erected in the Yamaha garage in 2008 to stop secrets swapping hands between his crew and that of his then-rookie team-mate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lorenzo retires</li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rossi described Lorenzo as "one of the most important MotoGP riders in the modern era" and believes they had "some of the best races" together.</p>
      <p>"I think we lose a very important part of our sport," said Rossi of Lorenzo's departure.</p>
      <p>"He is a great champion, he impressed me a lot of times for his speed and concentration.</p>
      <p>"From when he arrived in MotoGP, he was always strong, from 2008, so more than 10 years.</p>

      <p>"We were team-mates for a long time, a lot of years together we shared the same box and I think he's, personally, one of the greatest rivals of my career.</p>
      <p>"We did some of the best races together that I remember in my history, so it's a great shame that he's finished."</p>
      <p>Marc Marquez says his Honda team-mate's decision to step down showed he is a "true champion", and admits he and the team were surprised by the announcement.</p>
      <p>"Of course, it was a surprise even for his team-mate," Marquez said when asked to give his thoughts on Lorenzo's retirement.</p>
      <p>"In the team, we didn't know and it was a surprise.</p>

      <p>"Especially the way he working in the box - the results could have been better or worse - but the way he worked was exactly the same as his first day in Honda.</p>
      <p>"Just an hour ago I was with him in his truck to say congrats, obviously for his career, but especially the way he took the decision.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>"This is something that means a lot. He is a real champion. The moment he feels he can't be in the top places he decided to stop.</p>
      <p>"A strong character on and off the track, and a real champion. I want to say congrats to him and wish him the best for the future."</p>
