      <p>Navi Tech, previously known as BAC Acquisitions, was co-founded by Bansal and his IIT-Delhi batchmate Ankit Agarwal.</p>

He is busy re-purposing the Flipkart capital to build a robust portfolio, mainly in the financial sector and the mobility space and to also back other entrepreneurs in the country.</p>
      <p>According to Venture Intelligence, that tracks venture capital and private equity investments, till August Bansal made $53 million worth of equity investments — mainly in Ola and Ather Energy — while also making a number of debt investments.</p>
