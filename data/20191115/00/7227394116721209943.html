      <h1>Samsung Galaxy A50 firmware update causing fingerprint registration bug</h1>

      <p>Samsungâ€™s <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a50-9554.php">Galaxy A50</a> has been quite the success story in the past year, selling brilliantly in markets around the world.Now however, it's facing an issue as a recent firmware update has hindered the fingerprint registration process. Galaxy A50 users running on firmware versions <b>A505FNXXS3ASK9</b> and <b>A505FDDS3ASK8</b> are claiming that they can no longer register new fingerprints.</p>

      <p>Those two updates were supposed to improve fingerprint recognition and even advised users to re-register their fingerprints to benefit from the improved recognition features.</p>

      <p>For some, the enrollment process stops working at around the 41% mark and prompts them to make sure the sensor area is clean. Others manage to complete the whole process but the phone then rejects the newly enrolled fingerprints.</p>
      <p>Previously registered fingerprints seem to be working so its best to keep using those until the issue is resolved. Samsung is expected to release a new firmware fix soon which should deal with the problem once and for all.</p>
