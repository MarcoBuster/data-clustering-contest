      </p>
      <p>Poor Adam Schiff.</p>
      <p>The House Intelligence Committee chairman, in kicking off Day Two of impeachment hearings, was trying to maintain a show of law and order and professionalism and such and such — but Reps. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-jordan/">Jim Jordan</a> and Elise Stefanik kept interrupting him with calls for points of order.</p>
      <p>It was like Day One all over again.</p>

      <p>This was Stefanik, Day One: “Mr. Chairman, before we hear from the witnesses, I have a parliamentary inquiry … Mr. Chairman, when can we anticipate a response to our November 9 letter requesting certain individual witnesses to be called.”</p>
      <p>Schiff ducked and dodged, and answered that three of the witnesses requested by Republicans were scheduled to give testimony next week. But Stefanik wasn’t having any of it.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>“Those were your witnesses, Mr. Chairman,” she said. “What about the additional six witnesses?”</p>
      <p>Umm.</p>
      <p>“Umm,” began Schiff.</p>
      <p>Let the records reflect: Schiff replied “umm.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Day Two opened with more of the rocking, rolling, hilarious same.</p>
        <p>Schiff, after introducing Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and after reading what was supposed to be her impressive credentials — for the rapt undecideds among the watching, voting audience, you see — and after being torn a new one by Rep. Devin Nunes, who ticked off a list of ways, of many, many ways the Democrats have tipped their partisan, political, hateful hats in this impeachment process — well Schiff started to show signs of stress.</p>
        <p>First came Stefanik with her “point of order” and call for clarification on the witness list.</p>
        <p>Then came <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-jordan/">Jordan</a> with his “point of order” — make that repeated “points of order.”</p>
        <p>Schiff kept shutting him down. Schiff kept striking his gavel. And <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-jordan/">Jordan</a> kept calling for “point of order.”</p>
        <p>Never mind the search for high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>
        <p>This is high political theater and drama at its best.</p>
        <p>And into Schiff’s voice crept a little bit of tension; into his eyes, slipped a wider ring of white. Crack, crack, the facade of impeachment continues to crumble.</p>
