        <b>Staff at Tax Administration Jamaica's (TAJ) Oxford Road offices were earlier this week sent home after a number of them reported feeling ill.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yesterday, TAJ's Chief Corporate Communications Officer Meris Haughton confirmed that the 6th and 9th floors, where TAJ offices are located, were evacuated over concerns about poor air quality.</p>
      <p>“We have had some reports of some air quality issues at our location on the Oxford Road NCB South Towers. We have two floors on that building and based on the reports that we had gotten from persons we have, out of an abundance of caution and as a precautionary measure, asked the staff to stay home,” Haughton told the Jamaica Observer in a telephone interview.</p>
      <p>Haughton said the issue has been a recurring one, noting that complaints have surfaced in the immediate past. As a result, she said a company has been called in to test air quality in the offices and that a report is expected to be ready today.</p>
      <p>“I can't say much more until we get back that report from that company that we invited in to do the checks. It's because persons started feeling ill that the decision was taken. Persons were having some ill effects from whatever was in the air but we're not sure exactly what it is, so that's why we actually had the company come in to do some checks,” said Haughton.</p>
      <p>“We have been having some issues on and off for the past week or so. So based on the occurrence, because it's not consistent... we invited the company in to do some tests,” she added.</p>
