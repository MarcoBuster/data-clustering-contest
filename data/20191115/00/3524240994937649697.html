        </i>
      </p>
      <p>The House of Representatives has queried the Nigeria Postal Service which claimed not to have collected stamp duty between 2004 and 2015.</p>
      <p>The House Committee on Public Accounts issued the query in Abuja on Thursday when the Postmaster-General of the Federation,  Bisi Adegbuyi, appeared before it.</p>
      <p>Adegbuyi had informed the committee that NIPOST collected about N43,364,000 as stamp duties from February 2016 to November 9, 2019, which he said was domiciled in the Central Bank of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The Chairman of the PAC, Oluwole Oke, however, expressed shock that there was no records on stamp duty collection between 2004 and 2015.</p>
      <p>Oke asked, “What happened to collection between 2004 to 2015?”</p>
      <p>Responding, the Postmaster-General said, “To the best of my knowledge, Mr chairman, there was no collection.”</p>
      <p>The Director of Finance and Investment, NIPOST, Sha’aba Usman, explained that it was only in 2016 that the service started collecting stamp duty through commercial banks.</p>
      <p>The committee, consequently, invited all the banks collecting stamp duty on behalf of NIPOST  to appear before it next Thursday.</p>
      <p>In another development, the House of Representatives called for the suspension of the acting Registrar of the Corporate Affairs Commission, Mrs Azuka Azinge, for allegedly breaching a constitutional order by the federal parliament.</p>
      <p>The resolution followed the adoption of a motion moved by a member, Mr Gudaji Kazaure, which was unanimously adopted.</p>
      <p>Kazaure recalled that on April 25, 2019, the House considered the report by the Committee on Public Petitions and consequently resolved that the CAC should reinstate one  Sule Sale and equally urged the commission to pay all his salaries and entitlements from the date he was dismissed from service.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker said that since May 17, 2019, when the House directed the commission to obey its resolution, he said Azinge, in her letter addressed to the National Assembly dated July 3, 2019 with reference number CAC/RG/SEN/126/VOL.IV insisted that the decision of the central disciplinary committee of the commission superseded the resolution of the House.</p>
      <p>In another development, the House has called on the  Federal Government to install scanning machines in various seaports across the country.</p>
      <p>The House mandated the Committee on Ports and Harbours to organise a one-day stakeholders’ meeting towards installing scanners  at the country’s ports.</p>
      <p>Zakaure later addressed journalists to raise the alarm over the N1.3tn budget proposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria for the 2020 fiscal year, describing it as outrageous.</p>
      <p>
        <i>He said, “In 2019, the budget of the CBN was N420bn, but the same CBN brought a budget of N1.3tn for 2020. What are they producing? Which revenue are they generating?”</i>
