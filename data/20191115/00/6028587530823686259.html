      <p>This Vitaminwater ad may seem so 2011 because it is not officially being used anymore. But in many ways it is so 2019 too.Here is a picture of the advertisement that for some reason has been making the rounds on Twitter, eight years after it had been in stores:</p>
      <p>Oh no is right. No, Vitaminwater is not a replacement for the flu shot. No, vitamins are not a replacement for the flu shot. No, supplements are not a replacement for the flu shot. Not even close. Not even Pittsburgh Penguins versus a bunch of real penguins in hockey close.</p>
      <p>As the following tweet thread shows, Coca-cola rightfully got flak for posting such an ad, and I don’t mean flax seeds, which incidentally shouldn’t replace the vaccine either:</p>
      <p><a href="https://linkedin.com/home?trk=nav_responsive_tab_home">Matt Herper covered the revelation of this ad for <i>Forbes</i> back in 2011</a> and included a statement from Coca-Cola that said, "Vitaminwater is a great tasting, hydrating beverage with essential vitamins and water and people can clearly see from the labels, which are FDA compliant, what’s in every bottle. Vitaminwater has always had a fun, humorous and engaging personality — and our ads reflect that."</p>
      <p>OK, first of all, I have never met a bottle of liquid with a “humorous and engaging personality.” If that were the case, why not go out with a bunch of bottles rather than friends? Secondly, even suggesting that your product is better than a well-established, FDA-approved medical intervention is not a joke. Real medical products like vaccines are highly regulated and have undergone rigorous testing. There are very rigorous regulations about what a vaccine manufacturer can and can’t say on its product packaging or advertisements. For example, there can’t be jokes such as “now you don’t need a teleportation device” or “do you believe that you can fly,” because those could be viewed as medical claims.</p>
      <p>If you want to make a joke about a bottle of water with some supplements added, how about something more like: “what do you do when a man you know knocks on your door? Vitamin.” Now, that’s a joke.</p>
      <p>This brings us to 2019. Some people on Twitter actually thought that this was a new ad.</p>
      <p>That’s because unscientific claims or “jokes” about vaccines have certainly not gone away. In fact, things seem to have gotten much worse. It is hard to be on social media these days without seeing anti-vaccination statements or advertisements. You can tweet something seemingly completely unrelated to vaccines (like the other day when I tweeted about AI and data science) and still get some anonymous account responding with anti-vaccination claims. Them, there are other seemingly concerted efforts to spread anti-vaccination claims as well. For example, recently, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jrs-york-city-vaccine-forum-highlights-concerns/story?id=66158336">Erin Schumaker reported for <i>ABC News</i></a> about how anti-vaccination leaders are now targeting racial and ethnic minorities. Trying to take advantage of minorities? Great.</p>
      <p>The continuing question is if those spreading anti-vaccination claims were so concerned about what may be causing autism, why aren’t they instead focused more on the many other things in our environment that people contact each and every day? What about many of the additive-laden foods that people eat? Or supplements? Or all the artificial stuff in our environment? Or the pollution that’s being spewed out by burning fossil fuels?</p>
      <p>How much then of all these anti-vaccination claims are actually designed to sell other products or push some type of hidden money-making agenda? For example, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17538068.2016.1235531">a study published in 2016 in the <i>Journal of Communication in Healthcare</i></a> analyzed the content of 480 anti-vaccine websites and found that many co-promoted things such as alternative medicine, homeopathy, and eating certain types of diets. Even if an anti-vaccination claim doesn’t seem to be promoting a specific alternative product or program, could the strategy be trying to cast doubt on established medical interventions and science so that people are more willing to try things that have no scientific evidence behind them?</p>
      <p>As we can see, trying to advance unsupported claims are not so last year. They are in fact so this year and if something is not done they will be so next year and the next and the next and the next.</p>
