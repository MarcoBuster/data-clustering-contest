      <p>Capital markets regulator SEBI on November 15 put in place a mechanism for stock exchanges and depositories to map the unique client code (UCC) with the demat account of a client.</p>
      <p>"Stock exchanges and depositories shall map the existing UCCs with the demat account of the clients latest by December 31, 2019," the regulator said in a circular.</p>
      <p>Sebi said "UCC allotted by the trading member (TM) to the client shall be mapped with the demat account of the client."</p>

      </p>
      <p>"A client may trade through multiple TMs in which case each such UCC shall be mapped with one or more demat account(s)," it added.</p>
      <p>Sebi has asked the bourses to share the UCC data having PAN, segment, TM/CM (clearing member) code and the allotted UCC with the depositories.</p>
      <p>The UCC data is to be shared with the depositories on a one-time basis by November 30, 2019, and subsequently the incremental data in respect of new UCCs shall be shared on a daily basis, Sebi said.</p>
      <p>Besides, depositories need to map the UCC data in the demat account based on the PAN provided in the UCC database.</p>
      <p>Additionally, clients can make a request to their depository participants to delink or add UCC details which will then be processed by the depository through depository participants.</p>
      <p>Before any addition of UCC in the demat account, the depositories shall validate the same with the stock exchanges and client.</p>
      <p>The regulator has also asked exchanges and depositories to have a mechanism in place to address clients' complaints with regard to UCC mapping with their demat accounts.</p>
      <p>"Stock Exchanges and Depositories shall have a mechanism in place to ensure that inactive, non-operational UCCs are not misused and also a mechanism to ensure that inactive, non-operational UCCs are weeded out in the process of mapping clients' UCC with their demat account," Sebi said.</p>
      <p>The framework has been put in place pursuant to discussions with exchanges and depositories in order to facilitate ease in reconciliation, it added.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
