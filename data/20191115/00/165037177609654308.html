        <b>Germany boss Joachim Low has assessed his side's Euro 2020 chances and weighed in on the rumours linking Pep Guardiola to Bayern Munich.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joachim Low sees similarities between Germany's <b>youthful squad</b> and the <b>exciting 2010 vintage</b> but does not consider his team a leading Euro 2020 contender.</p>
      <p>Victory over Belarus in Monchengladbach on Saturday and <b>anything less than a win for Northern Ireland against Netherlands</b> would confirm Germany's place at next year's tournament.</p>
      <p>A developing Die Mannschaft have won <b>five of their past seven matches</b> and are starting to <b>build momentum after a rocky post-World Cup period.</b></p>
      <p>Just one member of the squad, captain Manuel Neuer, is over the age of 30 and Low compared the potential of the team to the one that reached the semi-finals in South Africa almost a decade ago.</p>
      <p>But the long-serving head coach moved to temper expectations of a serious challenge for silverware.</p>
      <p>"As of today we have a very <b>talented, ambitious, hungry team with a lot of potential,</b> comparable to the team for the 2010 World Cup," Low said.</p>
      <p>"But <b>we will not be among the absolute top favourites</b>. For that, many players have to be even further along in their development. We're working on it.</p>

      <p>"France, England have been playing with the same players for years. There's the Dutch, Spain… to play for a title is incredibly difficult. But the guys are really good, we have a good base."</p>

      <p><b>Neuer, 33</b>, will start in goal against Belarus, with Barcelona's <b>Marc-Andre ter Stegen</b> to take over for Tuesday's final Group C clash at home to Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Low confirmed two more Bayern Munich regulars, <b>Joshua Kimmich and Serge Gnabry</b>, would be in the starting XI this weekend following their impressive performances in the club's recent Bundesliga win over Borussia Dortmund. </p>
      <p>The Bundesliga champions, still without a full-time head coach, are now being linked with an audacious bid to bring Pep Guardiola back to Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>Asked about that scenario, Low replied: "Pep Guardiola was very good for the Bundesliga. He is one of the best coaches. I don't know if he will come back and whether he wants to [return] is just speculation<b>. I don't know what Bayern are planning, that's their business."</b></p>
