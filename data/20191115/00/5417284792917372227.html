      <h1>Drugs shortage expected to ease</h1>

      <p>The shortage of vaccines, antibiotics and selected ARVs across the country’s public health system is expected to ease in four weeks, Ministry of Health and Social Services Executive Director Ben Nangombe has told the Windhoek Observer.</p>
      <p>Nangombe’s assurance comes amid a crippling shortage of infant immunization vaccine, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals in most public health facilities countrywide.</p>
      <p>The ministry of health accounting officer admitted in emailed responses to the Windhoek Observer that the public health system has been experiencing shortages for some time because of an inherent complex and often time-consuming and time-sensitive pharmaceutical procurement system.</p>
      <p>“On several occasions, the non-availability of certain active ingredients of some drugs, including vaccines have led to supply shortages that have also affected Namibia and other countries negatively.</p>
      <p>Another challenge has been poor performance and delayed delivery on the part of suppliers who are awarded orders by the ministry,” he said.</p>
      <p>Nangombe said the ministry’s procurement procedures and processes have not always been what they desire them to be in terms of efficiencies and turn-around times.</p>
      <p>“We are looking into improving this situation. The procurement threshold for Offices/Ministries and Agencies has also not been helpful,” he said. </p>
      <p>An investigation by the ministry has shown that to execute procurement activities that can sufficiently meet national demand for pharmaceuticals, the procurement structures in the ministry would have to sit at least 80 times within 12 months to process procurements bids.</p>
      <p>Nangombe said this is highly inefficient as it takes not less than three months from the initiation of a normal procurement activity through the adjudication process, to the delivery of procured items to the ministry.</p>
      <p>“After careful analysis of the challenge, the ministry consulted with and later approached Treasury with a request for an exemption to procure sufficient quantities of clinical supplies and pharmaceuticals (beyond the ministerial procurement threshold of N$25 million) to address the reported shortages.</p>
      <p>“With specific regard to vaccines, the ministry sought and received an exemption from Treasury to procure vaccines, antibiotics, contraceptives and certain ARVs through Pooled Procurement Mechanisms jointly established by institutions such as Unicef, UNFPA, WHO, Global Fund, etc.”</p>
      <p>He said the ARVs included in this procurement are those that are not part of the annual ARV tender which was awarded by the Central Procurement Board in April.</p>
      <p>Through the pooled procurement mechanisms, the ministry said it will realize significant savings of up to N$100 million.</p>
      <p>“The supplies of the medicines stated above will cover the needs of the country for not less than 12 months based on the average monthly usage statistics from our health facilities countrywide.</p>
      <p>“This will provide sufficient time for the Central Procurement Board to finalize documentation for long term tenders for these pharmaceuticals. The process to procure from vaccines, antibiotics and selected ARVs has started and we expect delivery in the next four to five weeks, everything being equal,” Nangombe said.</p>
      <p>In parallel, the ministry has also procured small amounts, through local suppliers to cover the gap until the arrival of the Unicef order.</p>
      <p>“Once it arrives; the country is covered for not less than 12 months,” the health executive director said.</p>
      <p>“The Ministry of Health and Social Services is fully committed to addressing and normalizing the pharmaceuticals supply chain for the country. Challenges, bottlenecks, and shortcomings leading to shortages of pharmaceuticals and clinical supplies have been identified and are being addressed systematically.</p>
      <p>“We will indeed see better results and improved performance as far as the availability and supply of clinical supplies and pharmaceuticals in the country are concerned. We shall ensure that the reported shortages of these supplies in public health facilities become a thing of the past.”</p>
      <p>Nangombe further said the ministry has a clear strategy to resolve the problems in procurement and serve the people of Namibia better.</p>
      <p>“It is doable. The solutions are in our hands and the problem can be solved. This will become evident in the coming months.” –This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</p>
