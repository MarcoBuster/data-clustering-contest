      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Government regulators have again warned Dollar Tree’s parent company about importing drugs and cosmetics that could be tainted due to improper product testing during manufacturing.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/food-and-drug-administration/">Food and Drug Administration</a> said that Greenbrier International also did not properly perform its own lab analyses as required before releasing certain products, including an anti-dandruff shampoo and an acne face wash. The products were also mislabeled by the Chinese manufacturers.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/food-and-drug-administration/">FDA</a> told Greenbrier about violations at the Chinese companies as early as 2017. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/food-and-drug-administration/">FDA</a>’s Nov. 6 warning to Greenbrier International says that the company continued to receive products from companies on “import alert,” even after Greenbrier International agreed not to.</p>
