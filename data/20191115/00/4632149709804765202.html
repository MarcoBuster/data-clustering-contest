      <p>A GoAir aircraft with 180 passengers onboard veered off the runway into a grass pitch while attempting to land at the Kempegowda International Airport on Monday. <br/><br/>The incident occurred when flight G8-811D, which was arriving from Nagpur, attempted to land on the runway. However, due to poor visibility, the aircraft was asked to go-around. <br/><br/>One of the engines of the A320 stalled when the flight initiated the go-around process. <br/><br/>The aircraft took off and flew over the city skies for a while, waiting for the weather to improve. With no signs of the weather improving, the aircraft was diverted to Hyderabad. Due to poor visibility conditions, around 40 flights were delayed on the day this incident occurred. <br/><br/>The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has initiated a probe after the incident. <br/><br/>“It (aircraft) was cleared for approach for R/W 09 at Bengaluru. Due to bad weather at Bengaluru, the aircraft initiated go-around. During the go-around process engine number one stalled. The affected engine’s power weaned to idle but the aircraft continued to go-around. During the first climb, the engine stalled again and its power was again reduced to idle. The aircraft was diverted to Hyderabad with engine number 1 in climb detent,” said DGCA. <br/><br/><br/>Upon landing at the Hyderabad airport, some mud deposits was observed. It was then that the incident came to light. The DGCA ordered the grounding of the aircraft and initiated a probe. <br/><br/>“After landing at Hyderabad, mud deposit was observed on the left main landing gear, indicating that the aircraft has rolled onto soft ground/unpaved surface. As per the crew, aircraft has deviated to the left during the go-around at Bengaluru. The aircraft has been grounded for detailed investigation at Hyderabad. DFDR data along with other recorder data is being analyses for further investigation,” DGCA said. <br/><br/><br/>The aircraft’s pilot has been suspended by the regulator.</p>
