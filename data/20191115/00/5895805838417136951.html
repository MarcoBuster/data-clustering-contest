      <p>More often than not, people tend to focus on the negative rather the positive. Negativity has a way of keeping us up late at night as our thoughts replay over and over what happened during a particular unfavorable incident. On the flip side, positive experiences tend to create emotions and memories that are short-lived. Negative thoughts are commonly associated with poorer physical health as well as symptoms such as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a>. Research has consistently linked <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/positive-psychology">positive thinking</a> with good mental (Fagley, 2018) and physical health (Hill &amp; Roberts, 2018), in addition to positive relationship fulfillment (Bartlett et al., 2012). Although it may be easier to focus on the negatives in life, incorporating simple yet effective <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gratitude">gratitude</a> practices can significantly improve one’s overall mental and physical health, as well as social well-being.</p>

      <p>As the saying goes, “An attitude of gratitude goes a long way.” The Thanksgiving holiday is known for creating opportunities where individuals and families can freely express gratitude. When is the last time you reflected on the things that are going well in your life, the positive work or personal relationships you have with others or the last time someone made you feel special or even the last time you committed an act of kindness to allow someone else to feel special? Below are widely used gratitude exercises known to bring positive benefits. They can be completed alone or with others.</p>
      <p><b><i>Journaling</i></b>: Keeping a journal about things you are grateful for not only reduces <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> but also increases <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem">self-esteem</a>. This type of journaling can be short and simple such as highlighting as little as one to three things you are grateful for each day, including one good thing that happened to you today, something you accomplished today, something good you saw someone do today, or even something funny that happened today.</p>
      <p><i><b>Reflections: </b></i>Perhaps writing and journaling are not your thing, and that’s okay. Mentally reflecting on the positive aspects of your day can offer similar benefits to journaling. Reflecting on how people and relationships have positively impacted you tends to be more effective than reflecting on tangible things alone (Froh et al., 2011). For example, you may experience gratitude and positive emotions after purchasing a new car, but the benefits of relationship-centered gratitude tend to be longer-lasting.</p>
      <p><i><b>Meditations: </b></i>Primary differences between reflection and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/meditation">meditation</a> may include the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mindfulness">mindfulness</a> nature and time invested in the activity. Meditation is not about rushing, but taking your time to be aware of what you are grateful for and why. For example, more than simply identifying someone you admire and are grateful for, a meditation exercise may go further by focusing more specifically on what it is about that person that makes you grateful, and why. Perhaps you may be grateful for the way your boss is honest with you, even when they give you feedback about your work that does not necessarily make you feel good. In this scenario, meditating on the acceptance of honest communication may lead to increased rapport and strengthened work dynamics between an employee and their boss.</p>
      <p><i><b>Sharing:</b></i> You likely heard the phrase “sharing is caring.” After you identified the things and people you are grateful for, you may choose to not keep this positivity to yourself. Sharing your gratitude with others may include presenting a journal entry to them, reading the journal entry to them, or even paraphrasing in simple conversation what and who you are grateful for. Sharing your gratitude with others not only reaffirms the positive things in your life but also has the ability to bring positivity to others.</p>
      <p>Surely favorite dishes will be passed around the table this upcoming holiday. As the turkey and stuffing go around, don’t forget about the far-reaching impact gratitude can have on yourself and others.</p>
