      <p>A 45-year-old policewoman has narrated to an Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court how a policeman named Mohammed Alidu allegedly defiled her nine-year-old daughter inside a police barracks in Lagos.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the policewoman was the second prosecution witness in the trial of Alidu, a police sergeant, for defilement.</p>
      <p>She said the defendant accosted her daughter on her way home from school, dragged her into his apartment and defiled her.</p>
      <p>She stated, “We live at Makinde Barracks, Mafoluku, Oshodi, Lagos.</p>
      <p>“On June 29, 2018, I was at work when my husband, who was out of Lagos, called to inform me that Sgt. Mohammed had defiled our daughter.</p>
      <p>“I went to the police station which is within the same compound of the barracks and my daughter was there.</p>
      <p>“My daughter told me that when she was coming back from school, Mohammed called her but she ignored him.</p>
      <p>“She said he forcefully took her to his apartment, put her on a bed, tore her underwear and defiled her.”</p>
      <p>According to the woman, Alidu was also at the police station begging and telling the Divisional Police Officer that it was the work of the devil.</p>
      <p>The policewoman said her daughter was taken to the Mirabel Centre (a sexual assault referral centre) for medical examination, and doctors confirmed that she had been defiled.</p>
      <p>During cross-examination by defence counsel, Mr Sunday Odise, the policewoman told the court that the defendant lived near her residence.</p>
      <p>She said, “He did not have a house within the barracks. He was sleeping in a shop opposite our home.” </p>
