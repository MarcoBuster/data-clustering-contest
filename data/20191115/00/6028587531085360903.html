      <h1>Beat This Amazon Black Friday Deal: $15 Free Money</h1>

      <p>Amazon is always trying to get your attention with Black Friday sales (or Prime Day sales). But, every so often, they get your attention with something better than a product sale — free cash, in this case $15, is what they are offering right now and here are some details of if and how you might qualify.Free cash in the form of a gift card is not cash, but still, free money. If you qualify, and it is not a high bar to get over, you can get a $15 credit when you purchase at least $50 in Amazon Gift Cards. The qualification? If you are a new gift card customer, as in you have never purchased a gift card on Amazon.com before, you are eligible. It appears that for most people, you could buy and use these cards yourself, but even if you cannot, buy a couple of $25 cards for friends and family and the $15 goes directly into your account.</p>
      <p>I cannot find any official Amazon announcement and cannot see the exact web offer since I do not “qualify.” One of the criteria is that you have never purchased a digital or physical gift card via the Amazon site before (I have). My point is, hurry over and check this out because I do not know how long it will last. It certainly appears to be tied to Black Friday and holiday season specials and a desire to motivate you to check out any and all offers from the online giant. </p>

      <h3>Free $15 Amazon Black Friday Holiday Gift Card Offer</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/2COVgau">SHOP NOW</a>
      </p>
      <p>Amazon is currently offering $15 account credit to Gift Card purchasers</p>
      <p>It appears that you do not have to be an Amazon Prime member to use this offer. If you find that it is not working, but that the site does not say you are “Ineligible” (as it does to me), then try using the promotional code as you add these items to your shopping cart (do not click purchase or Buy Now until you are certain you are getting the promotional credit). Promo code is “19GIFTCARD” and I have asked a friend who is eligible for the offer to screenshot what she saw in her account, inserted below right.</p>

      <p>You may not see a box to enter the coupon code 19GIFTCARD. As long as you do not see a line of obvious text that says you are ineligible, you should be able to us this offer. I have heard that people have better luck using the above process (Click the Gift Card image above) as it takes you directly to the offer page.</p>
      <p>As you see on the screenshot, once you buy $50 worth (or more, but not less) of the digital Amazon gift cards, you will see that a message that the $15 promo credit will be applied to your account within 48 hours. Note: If you prefer to buy physical cards to use as gifts, there are many options to choose from in terms of designs that appeal to kids or book lovers. You will receive those cards in the postal mail.</p>
      <p>Again, as a caution, if you do not see a button or that ineligible message, proceed slowly as you likely do not qualify and if you click that Buy Now button, you will likely buy $50 worth of cards with no bonus. This will happen because you have purchased gift cards from Amazon before and they are not interested in paying you to buy more. Buyer beware on this part, but it is a valid offer for new gift card purchasers.</p>
      <p>Normally, I do not urge people to hurry to buy something, but this is a fun and easy $15 deal that is a no-brainer. UPDATE: It says it is good until December 22 on the offer page screenshot above. But I would not wait, if I were you. Happy Black Friday shopping at Amazon and elsewhere.</p>
