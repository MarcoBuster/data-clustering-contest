      <h1>Peter Garrett Joined Bad//Dreems For A Moving And Pointed ‘Like A Version’</h1>

      <p>Adelaide’s BAD//DREEMS bought in a stack of friends into the triple j studios for their <i>Like A Version</i>, including Peter Garrett.</p>
      <p>The band needed a bit of help for their cover of choice — Warumpi Band’s 1985 anti-racism rock song ‘Blackfella/Whitefella’. In addition to Garrett, BAD//DREEMS enlisted Emily Wurramara and Don Nunggarrgalu &amp; Brad Bara from Mambali, a nine piece from South East Arnhem Land and one of <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/music/mambalis-big-sound-at-bigsound/news-story/1417c63ee0bd3ca8a2b1c09c579ebc13">the standouts at this year’s Bigsound</a>.</p>

      <p>The final product sees DREEMS’ lead singer Ben Marwe and Garrett alternate verses, with Wurramara on backing vocals. Bara takes over in the bridge over clapping sticks and a didgeridoo.</p>
      <p>With so many people in the studio, there wasn’t a lot of room — but don’t worry, Garrett still did a lot of decidedly Garrett movements. It’s a stirring track surmised best by an early YouTube comment: “This is what <i>Like a Version</i> is all about.”</p>
      <p>The timely cover arrives in a week of nation-wide protests after a 28-year-old police officer allegedly shot dead a 19-year-old Warlpiri man Kumanjayi Walker over the weekend. The officer has <a href="https://junkee.com/police-officer-charged-indigenous-death/229676">since been charged with murder</a>.</p>
      <p>BAD//DREEMS also performed a rendition on ‘Sonny’, their lead single from third album <i>Doomsday Ballet</i>, released last month. The four-piece just finished up a national tour, and are about to head to Europe.
