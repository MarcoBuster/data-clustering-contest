      <p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Sergiño Dest was in the starting lineup at right back for the United States in Friday night’s CONCACAF Nations League match against Canada, an appearance that will tie him to the U.S. program.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old defender has become a regular for Ajax this season and played in a pair of exhibitions for the U.S. in September. The son of a Surinamese-American father and Dutch mother, he played for the U.S. at the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups but was recruited this fall by the Dutch national team.</p>
      <p>Because Nations League games are competitive matches, Dest would be unable to switch once he appears for the U.S.</p>
