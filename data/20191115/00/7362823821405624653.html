      <p>The cast attended an annual gala to support Marshall’s 130-seat theater in Burbank, Calif.  Marshall founded the Burbank landmark in 1997 when it was called the Falcon. It was recognized as the Garry Marshall Theater in 2017.</p>

      <p>The castmates took a sentimental trip down Memory Lane and chatted about their time with the classic sitcom, recalling time spent on the Paramount lot with Marshall, who died in July 2016.</p>
      <p>According to E<a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/14/happy-days-actors-reunite-garry-marshall-tribute/">ntertainment Weekly</a>, Howard, 65, opened up about a chance encounter with Marshall that led to an audition for a “Love, American Style” spinoff that Howard said “kept me out of the f---ing jungle” during the Vietnam War.</p>
      <p>The same meeting also led to Howard’s break as a director.</p>

      <p>Winkler recalled coming to Los Angeles from New York, having studied drama at Yale, to audition for the role of the Fonz. “They wanted a tall Italian and they got a short Jew,” Winkler joked. The 74-year-old was nominated for an Emmy three times for “Happy Days” and eventually won two as a co-star opposite Bill Hader in the HBO series “Barry.”</p>

      <p>“You never saw two guys who filled the top spot so beautifully [than Howard and Winkler],” she said. “I’m proud to be their mother.”</p>
      <p>Most was in his junior year at Lehigh University when he auditioned for “Happy Days,” according to the outlet, and the 66-year-old said of his time on the show, “we were so good at what we did because we respected each other and loved each other."</p>
      <p>He added, "We made it look easy and it wasn’t.”</p>

      <p>Williams, 70, simply said he was grateful that Marshall often encouraged him to explore other opportunities in show business, which led to work as a director of episodic television.</p>
      <p>“Marshall said, ‘You may not be actors all your life, especially you, Anson,” said Williams. “He actually said that. ... He gave us an amazing break. He gave us a life.”</p>
