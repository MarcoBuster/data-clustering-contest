      <p>Summit Racing Equipment’s commitment to NHRA bracket racers was on full-display at the 2019 Auto Club NHRA Finals. It brought together the top Super Pro, Pro, Sportsman, and Super Pro Motorcycle racers from NHRA’s seven divisions to the Auto Club Raceway at Pomona to compete in the NHRA Summit Racing Series National Championship.</p>

      <p>And on Thursday night, after the quarter-mile action came to a close, the spotlight turned from the cars to the drivers, teams, and member tracks in attendance as Summit Racing Equipment celebrated sportsman racers for its 20th year with the NHRA Summit Racing Series National Championship.</p>
      <p>Summit Racing’s Jim Greenleaf and Don Lower hosted the racers and the participating member tracks for dinner, and tipped their hats to sportsman racers at all levels. Don Lower, Summit Racing’s Motorsports Coordinator extended that sentiment and offered his congratulations to all of the teams and tracks that had produced this year’s competitors. “Thank you for your business, thank you for your support, thank you for supporting your local tracks. You are going to be part of history.”</p>
