        <b>Mario Mandzukic could try his luck at MLS. This is, atleast, David Beckham's intention. The former English footballer is still sorting out the profile for his new team, Inter Miami, and has thought about the Croatian to lead in attack.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to 'CalcioMercato',<b> several clubs in the US league are interested in Mandzukic</b>. The first, is David Beckham's new side.</p>
      <p>This source states that the team that would have been most interested in having the striker is <b>Inter Miami.</b> However, there has still been no firm offer.</p>

      <p>At Juventus he<b> has not played so far this season.</b> Mandzukic has not played one minute, so the doors remian wide open for him to try his luck somewhere else next summer.</p>
      <p>His future is unknown, but everything seems to indicate that he will not play in Italy next season.<b> United and Borussia Dortmund are also follwoing </b>the Croatian closely.</p>
      <p>Everything seems to indicate that, wherever his next destination is, Mandzukic will be one of the goalscorers who will <b>revolutionise the winter market.</b> <b>There will be a fight for the Juventus player.</b></p>
