      <p>On November 15, members of project group <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/x1">X1</a> were spotted at Incheon international airport, returning to Korea from their overseas schedules in order to attend the '<b>2019 V Live Awards V Heartbeat</b>' taking place this weekend on November 16. </p>
      <p>However, 'V Heartbeat' revealed on November 14 that X1 will not be attending the award ceremony's red carpet event, but only perform during their allotted segment of the event. X1's label <b>Swing Entertainment </b>stated regarding the upcoming event, <i>"Because this schedule was confirmed before [the police investigation], we could not cancel the group's appearance one-sidedly and cause difficulties for the other party."</i> Many fans set to attend the ceremony this weekend were given pre-sale privileges through a paid membership. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other artists performing at the upcoming '2019 V Live Awards V Heartbeat', taking place on November 16 at the Gocheok Sky Dome, include <b>AB6IX</b>, <b>TOMORROW x TOGETHER</b>, <b>Stray Kids</b>, <b>ITZY</b>, <b>CIX</b>, <b>MAMAMOO</b>, <b>MONSTA X</b>, <b>GOT7</b>, <b>Nell</b>, and <b>Anne Marie</b>. </p>
