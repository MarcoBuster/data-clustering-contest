      <h1>Microsoft’s big plans for xCloud game streaming</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft plans to launch its Project xCloud game streaming service next year, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964434/microsoft-xcloud-preview-ps4-controller-windows-10-support-2020"><b>The Verge</b></a>.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the publication, Microsoft’s head of gaming Phil Spencer said he expects xCloud to be “generally available” in 2020.</p>
      <p>The company plans to integrate the service with its subscription offering, Xbox Game Pass.</p>
      <p>This means xCloud will allow gamers to stream games that form part of the Xbox Game Pass library from the cloud to a range of devices, including Android-based smartphones and tablets.</p>
      <p>Microsoft will add support for streaming on Windows 10 PCs next year and is currently also trialling xCloud on iOS devices.</p>
      <h3>50 more titles for preview</h3>
      <p>In addition to the reveal of its launch window, Microsoft added 50 more titles to the beta version of the service yesterday.</p>
      <p>The preview was originally launched on 14 October, with five games available to play for testers in the US, UK, and South Korea.</p>
      <p>New titles now include Devil May Cry 5, Tekken 7, Forza Horizon 4, Crackdown 3 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</p>
      <p>Microsoft will also roll out the beta to Canada, India, Japan, and Western Europe in 2020.</p>
      <h3>The competition</h3>
      <p>The announcement comes days before Google is due to launch its cloud game streaming service <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/323386-google-stadia-launch-date-and-details.html"><b>Stadia</b></a>.</p>
      <p>That service will have 12 titles available at launch, with 14 more arriving in 2019. Together with future launches, this puts Stadia’s library at 44 games.</p>
      <p>Various publications have reported that Google may struggle to build the type of catalogue that streaming rivals like Microsoft and Valve could offer.</p>
