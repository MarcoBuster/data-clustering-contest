      <h1>Wayfair adds AR, 3D tools to help you create your dream room in its app</h1>
      <h2>The new features can analyze the 3D space of a room from a 2D image</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:09:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/shruti-shekar" target="_blank">Shruti Shekar</a></address>
      <p>Wayfair, the popular e-commerce company for home-goods and furniture, will now help you design rooms with a new augmented reality feature.</p>
      <p>The new AR feature, called ‘View in Room 3D,’ lets users take a picture of their room to see various products added to it virtually.</p>
      <p>The new feature is very similar to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/ikea-place/id1279244498">Ikea’s Place app</a> that helps position furniture, but instead, Wayfair is photo-based and works if a user is not physically at home.</p>
      <p>Wayfair says that the technology powering the app analyzes the <a href="https://investor.wayfair.com/news/news-details/2019/Wayfair-Unveils-New-Mobile-App-Features-Makes-Shopping-for-Home-from-Anywhere-Easier-Than-Ever-Before/default.aspx">3D space of a room from a 2D image</a>.</p>
      <p>Another new feature built into the app includes the ability to search for furniture by taking a photo of what you’re looking for. This is similar to Google’s Lens image search.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Wayfair also has included Room Planner 3D, a new tool that will let users create a 3D room that they can interact with and design. Users will be able to view furniture from any angle and products will be added to the room at the correct scale.</p>
      <p>Wayfair is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/wayfair-shop-all-things-home/id836767708">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wayfair.wayfair&amp;hl=en_CA">Android</a>. It’s worth noting that some features, including Room Planner, are only available on iOS.</p>
