      <h1>Shivanna to produce Tagaru sequel</h1>

      <p><i>The actor also has his 125th film, a web-series and a film in which he plays the villain, coming up</i> <br/><br/>A sequel to Tagaru is coming. And it will be the home production of Shiva Rajkumar. The Suri-directed Tagaru was one of the biggest films of 2018. The title song continues to be a chart buster two years down the line. Shiva Rajkumar cannot get off any stage without dancing to its tune and obliging fans. <br/><br/>There was always talks about a sequel to this ‘cop vs gangsters’ saga. Shiva Rajkumar has confirmed it. Suri will continue as director. But no schedule has been fixed. Suri is currently handling two other films. Shiva Rajkumar himself has signed a handful. Tagaru 2 will come, but not anytime soon. <br/><br/><br/>After his 100th film Jogayya in 2011, we could see the release of his 125th film sometime in late 2020 or early 2021. The 125th film is most likely to be Bhairathi Ranagal, the name of the character he played in Mufti. Director Narthan is the director of this landmark film for the actor. <br/><br/>There was buzz in the industry that Shiva Rajkumar has signed up to play the antagonist in a film for KRG Studios. The actor has more or less confirmed it saying that it would be challenge to play the villain in a film. His only concern is how his hardcore fans would receive the idea of him playing a villain for the first time in his long career. Sources say that director Yogi B Raj is scripting a film which will have Shivanna in a negative role. <br/><br/><br/>Shivanna will also become the first top star in Kannada in a web series. It is also a home production with his daughter Niveditha producing it. He has three more films before he starts with Tagaru 2 or Bhairathi Ranagal.</p>
