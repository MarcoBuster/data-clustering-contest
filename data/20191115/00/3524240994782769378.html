      <p>The Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has said that the future of Nigeria depends on discipline and the quality of education, which school principals give to pupils under their supervision.</p>
      <p>Nwajiuba, who was represented by the Director, Basic and Secondary Education at the Federal Ministry of Education, Mrs Binta Abdulkadir, at the 2019 Annual General Meeting of Principals of Federal Unity Colleges in Lagos on Tuesday, said education was highly valued all over the world for its ability to develop the human potential.</p>
      <p>He said, “Empirical evidence shows that countries with highly developed educational systems are also the ones with successful economies and high standards of living.</p>
      <p>“Let me use this opportunity to assure you once again that the Federal Government will continue to raise the quality of education in federal unity colleges and give every student equal educational opportunity to succeed and achieve his or her full potential.”</p>
      <p>The minister said the task of achieving an outstanding secondary education system should not be seen as the government’s responsibility alone.</p>
      <p>“It takes more than the efforts of the government to achieve an outstanding secondary education system. It is clear, that unless we have principals that are competent and committed to translating the Federal Government’s vision for these colleges into reality by providing the right kind of leadership that will galvanise them into producing individuals who are ready to face the future with appropriate knowledge, creative skills, positive attitudes and positive social values, our efforts will not be fruitful,” he said.</p>
      <p>He, however, challenged the principals to ameliorate challenges in the education sector.</p>
      <p>The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Arch. Sonny Echono, urged the principals to join the government to move Nigerian education forward.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Echono, who was also represented by the Director of tertiary education in the ministry, Mr Samuel Ojo, said that principals, being the custodians of human knowledge, were trusted with the responsibility of shaping the minds, attitudes, talents and moral health of the young ones.</i>
