      <p>Jan Blachowicz welcomed former UFC middleweight titleholder Luke Rockhold to the light heavyweight division in a rather unfriendly manner. Blachowicz knocked out Rockhold at the 1:39 mark of the second round of that July fight. After the win, Blachowicz called for a matchup against current UFC light heavyweight kingpin Jon Jones. The UFC opted to deny Blachowicz his request. Instead, he welcomes another long-time middleweight to the 205-pound division when he faces Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza in the main event of Saturday’s UFC Fight Night 164.</p>
      <p>Souza, who has alternated wins and losses in his past six fights, is coming off a decision loss to Jack Hermansson in April. Here are some stats, facts and numbers for the upcoming matchup between Rua and Craig.</p>
