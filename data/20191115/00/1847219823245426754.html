        <b>Political party <i>Harmony</i>’s faction in Riga City Council has decided to halt its work in the coalition until <i>Honour to Service Riga</i> (GKR) makes up its mind in regards to cooperation with <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i>, as confirmed by Riga City Council’s vice-chairman Anna Vladova on Thursday, 14 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This means the faction will not take part in any committee and city council’s meeting until GKR has made its decision.</p>
      <h3>At the same time, Vladova stressed that GKR understands this position and the party is prepared to wait for their partners’ decision.</h3>
      <p>According to Harmony’s representatives, putting work in the coalition on hold does not mean they will step down from committee heads and other posts. All duties will be performed in accordance with the law, they stressed. Additionally, the faction will attend the 18 November festive meeting of Riga City Council. The 20 November meeting will not be attended if GKR fails to make any new decisions by then.</p>
      <p>«We want and are prepared to continue working with GKR, but not in the current format. This is not possible – to organize stable work in such a way,» said Vladova, stressing that her party respects GKR’s desire to consider decisions.</p>
      <p>Vladova’s colleague Mihails Kameņeckis stresses that the first meeting the faction is prepared to attend is the one that will discuss the topic of Independent Deputies faction member and ex-<i>Harmony</i> deputy Vadims Baraņņiks’ dismissal from his posts.</p>
      <p>According to him, Baraņņiks should have stepped down from his post the day he was excluded from Harmony, because it was Harmony’s members who elected him in the first place.</p>
      <p>«If our coalition partners had any illusions about working with those four deputies and maintain this collapsing structure, they no longer have any. This is why we decided to outline this topic,» said Kameņeckis.</p>
      <p>Politicians do not hide that absence from three consecutive meetings may result in dismissal of the entire city council. Nevertheless, deputies are not afraid of this scenario.</p>
      <p>When asked if any of other political parties could assist putting together the new coalition, <i>Harmony</i> members said «anything can happen in politics».</p>
      <p>Harmony’s chairman Jānis Urbanovičs said with this option Harmony’s faction has found a good way to liven up partners to work more actively and focus on fulfilling promises.</p>
