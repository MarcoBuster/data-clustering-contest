      <h1>This Handheld C64 Design Study Needs To Be Made</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/lewinday/" target="_blank">Lewin Day</a></address>
      <p>The Commodore 64 remains the best selling home computer of all time, and is unlikely to be toppled anytime soon. It continues to inspire a diehard community of makers and hackers to this day. [Cem Tezcan] is one of those people, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/dOqA8K">and his design study of a handheld C64 is utterly droolworthy</a>.</p>

        <figcaption>It’s quite likely that you’d run out of power before the cassette finished loading, but hey, we can dream.</figcaption>

      <p>The study includes renders of the device from several angles, as well as a basic blueprint outlining the various components. It features period accurate hardware, using a membrane keyboard, micro-cassettes for data storage, and a 3.5″ CRT. Other nice touches are the big red textured FIRE button, and a horrible early 80s 3.5mm jack.</p>
      <p>The C64 hardware of the time required both 12 V and 5V power, and the current draw of even a small CRT would be high. It’s likely such a handheld would have battery life measured in minutes. It’s a wonderful picture of what could have been, though we suspect that such a design would have pushed the limits of the technology of the time.</p>
      <p>However, electronics has matured since, and we sit here rather comfortably in 2019. We’d love to see the best handheld C64 that the community can muster, and with 3D printers and FPGAs on hand, it’s an eminently achievable feat. Bonus points to anyone who can make a microdatasette interface, too. <a href="http://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip">All submissions to the tips line</a>, and meanwhile, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/03/12/its-raining-brand-new-commodore-64s/">consider how easy it is to build a new C64 from scratch</a>. Happy hacking!</p>
