        <b>The war between the RFEF ans La Liga continues. This time it is the Spanish Federation that has asked for Javier Tebas to be dismissed as president of the LFP.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This Friday, it was made public that the justice will not let La Liga play the Villarreal-Atletico Madrid match in Miami. That is why,<b> after the ruling, the RFEF asked for Javier Tebas to be sacked.</b></p>
      <p>"It reiterates the request of the La Liga club members to engage in dialogue with the Federation and<b> ask for the immediate dismissal of the La Liga President or for his immediate resignation,"</b> the RFEF wrote in a statement.</p>
      <p>The game between Villarreal and Atletico Madrid was due to take place in Miami on 6 December, according to La Liga. However,<b> the jury has given the go-ahead to the RFEF, </b>so it will be played in Villarreal, to which the competition replied by changing the time of the match.</p>
      <p>"The League <b>wishes to express its utmost respect for a decision</b> that does not prejudge the substance of the matter, which will be resolved at the final hearing next February 2020. It's a long-term strategy," La Liga said after the ruling was announced.</p>
      <p>It was from then on that the Federation sent its statement. "As determined by the judge of the Mercantile No. 2 of Madrid on the subject of Friday and Monday and has again put it into evidence on the day, <b>La Liga 'cannot act' outside the Federation," </b>added the RFEF.</p>

      <p>It is remarkable the fact that<b> La Liga has seen all the petitions that they have formed against the RFEF rejected in recent months</b>," said the Federation, which pointed the finger to Javier Tebas.</p>
      <p>"The president of the League, Javier Tebas, has filed all kinds of lawsuits and appeals against the RFEF, in what is considered <b>a flight forward to justify their own mistakes</b>," said the RFEF.</p>
      <p>The statement did not stop there: "This way of proceeding has led two Spanish clubs<b> to breach the rules of FIFA and UEFA</b>, causing an interference of the legal-public system in aspects that FIFA and UEFA consider to be completely private".</p>
      <p>"These clubs, which are<b> subject to national and international football regulations, </b>were aware at all times before the ruling that they were facing significant and serious sporting and/or economic sanctions for their actions contrary to FIFA's decisions and the most basic principles of international sporting regulations," he concluded.</p>
