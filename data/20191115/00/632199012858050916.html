      <p>Fleet volumes at Manheim increased by 8.2% year-on-year and 22% month-on-month in October, reports Cox Automotive.</p>
      <p>The increased volume met strong buyer demand, and the average price achieved by fleet vehicles rose by 6.5% year-on-year, and 8.9% month-on-month.</p>
      <p>October was a more challenging month in other areas of the automotive industry, however.</p>
      <p>In the latest dealer sentiment survey from Modix, Cox Automotive’s digital marketing arm, 55% of dealers reported that consumer demand was down year-on-year.</p>
      <p>Philip Nothard, customer strategy and insight director at Cox Automotive, said: “Fleet volumes in the wholesale market have been fairly low over recent months, but October’s data suggests that green shoots are starting to show.</p>
      <p>“Some of the additional volume will have come as a result of greater clarity on taxation. In addition, the challenging retail environment saw OEMs shift their focus to the fleet market.”</p>
      <p>In terms of fuel type, electric vehicle (EV) prices continued to rise, with a 54% average price increase year-on-year. This large swing is partly due to the relatively low volume of EVs offered at auction but does indicate growing dealer confidence in selling electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>The average price for diesel vehicles continued to fall, and this reflects the lower volume of 1-3 year old diesel vehicles entering the market.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Nothard predicts that the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) legislation due to take effect in January 2020 will begin to affect the market.</p>
      <p>Nothard explained: “The CAFE legislation measures fleet emissions, and it’s likely that OEMs will be keen to offer favourable deals on higher emission vehicles between now and the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“On the other side of the coin, we may see OEMs hold back lower emission vehicles until January, but hopefully 2020 will see improved availability of these popular vehicles.”</p>
