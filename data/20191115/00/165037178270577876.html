        <b>Italy have won a record-breaking 10 straight matches and we look back at the run of Roberto Mancini's side.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Roberto Mancini and his Italy side broke new ground in their <b>comfortable 3-0 win at Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> on Friday.</p>
      <p>The victory in the Euro 2020 qualifier not <b>only ensured they maintained a 100 per cent record </b>in Group J but also saw the Azzurri rack up a <b>10th consecutive triumph</b>.</p>
      <p>No Italy side has <b>ever achieved such a feat </b>and they will look to stretch the streak in their final qualifier against Armenia on Monday.</p>
      <p>Below, we take a look back at Italy's <b>record-breaking run.</b></p>

        <b>Italy 1-0 United States: Nov 20, 2018</b>
      </p>
      <p>The run started with an unconvincing 1-0 victory over USA in Genk a little under a year ago. Italy dominated proceedings but needed Matteo Politano's 94th-minute strike to secure the win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Italy 2-0 Finland: Mar 23, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>Euro 2020 qualifying started in convincing fashion for Mancini's men in Udine. Nicolo Barella's deflected effort and a first Azzurri goal for Moise Kean did the damage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Italy 6-0 Liechtenstein: Mar 26, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fabio Quagliarella became Italy's oldest international scorer at the age of 36 as Liechtenstein were hammered in Parma. The veteran scored two penalties in the rout - the latter after Daniel Kaufmann was sent off on the stroke of half-time - while Stefano Sensi, Marco Verratti, Kean and Leonardo Pavoletti were also on target. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Greece 0-3 Italy: Jun 8, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>A flying start to qualifying continued in Athens in a match that was essentially over thanks to a three-goal 10-minute salvo in the first half. Barella's thumping opener was added to by Lorenzo Insigne's sumptuous strike, before Leonardo Bonucci headed in the third. </p>

        <b>Italy 2-1 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Jun 11, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>In one of the trickiest encounters during Italy's run, the hosts fell behind to Roma striker Edin Dzeko's close-range effort after 32 minutes. Insigne levelled shortly after the break, but it took until the 86th minute for Verratti to curl home the winner.</p>

        <b>Armenia 1-3 Italy: Sep 5, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>Italy again had to come from behind after Aleksandre Karapetian put Armenia in a surprise lead, but he was sent off after Andrea Belotti's leveller. Still, it was not until the 77th minute that Lorenzo Pellegrini headed the visitors ahead, and an unfortunate own goal from goalkeeper Aram Ayrapetyan rounded out the win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Finland 1-2 Italy: Sep 8, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>A hectic final 30 minutes saw Teemu Pukki cancel out Ciro Immobile's header to draw Finland level from the penalty spot. However, a spot-kick of their own from Jorginho after a handball from Sauli Vaisanen maintained Italy's 100 per cent record in qualifying.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Italy 2-0 Greece: Oct 12, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>A month later, another Jorginho penalty set Italy on their way against Greece in Rome and Federico Bernardeschi added a second as the Azzurri booked their place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liechtenstein 0-5 Italy: Oct 15, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was another luckless night for Liechtenstein, who were turned over in Vaduz. Belotti scored twice, while Bernardeschi, Alessio Romagnoli and Stephan El Shaarawy put their names on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-3 Italy: Nov 15, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>The record-breaking day arrived in Zenica as Italy controlled proceedings. Francesco Acerbi's first goal for his country and Insigne's strike after 37 minutes had the visitors coasting at the break. Belotti struck a fine third to ensure a new landmark was set.</p>
