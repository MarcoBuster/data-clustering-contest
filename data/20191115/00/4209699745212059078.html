      <p>Modupe Kolawole, the mother of a one-year-old boy, Eniola, declared missing at a popular church in Akure, Ondo State, has accused the 'prophet' of the church of using armed policemen to harass her family.<br/><br/>Little Eniola Gold Kolawole was last Sunday said to have disappeared at the Sotitobire Miracle Centre in Akure, during a special service at the church.<br/><br/>SaharaReporters had reported that the church, located at the Oshinle Quarters of Akure, was founded by Prophet Babatunde Omoemi.<br/><br/>Eniola was dropped at the creche section by his mother during the Sunday service but was declared missing shortly before the end of the programme.<br/><br/>Mrs. Kolawole told SaharaReporters on Friday that the workers of the church had been harassing her family for asking questions about the whereabouts of their son.<br/><br/>The distraught woman said Omoemi did not assist in searching for the missing child.<br/><br/>According to her, her mother-in-law, Kemisola Kolawole, was on Tuesday arrested and detained by the police anti-kidnapping squad.</p>

      <p>"The police are not helping over this case at all. A toddler found at the roadblock area in Akure on Wednesday is not my child. They have not seen my baby.</p>

      <p>"It's unfortunate that the police that supposed to be protecting the citizens are the ones being used to harass and intimidate us.<br/><br/>"My mother-in-law has been detained since Tuesday. They did not allow us to see her since then.<br/><br/>"The sad aspect of it is that no worker has been arrested in the church by the police since my child got missing in the place.<br/><br/>"Although, we have contacted our lawyer and he would write a petition to the commissioner of police to intervene over this issue of my stolen child."<br/><br/>But police said it had begun its investigation into the disappearance of the boy on the church premises.<br/><br/>The spokesman for the police in the state, Femi Joseph, said detectives from the state command would rescue the toddler alive.<br/><br/>Joseph explained that there was no formal report of the incident from any quarters, based on the understanding between the parents of the abducted boy and the church leadership.
