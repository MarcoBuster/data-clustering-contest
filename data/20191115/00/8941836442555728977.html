      <p>LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) - Trevelin Queen scored 20 points, including three 3-pointers, Ivan Aurrecoechea added 19 points, and New Mexico State beat Southern 79-63 on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Shawn Williams hit 4 of 6 from 3-point range and finished with 17 points for New Mexico State.</p>
      <p>Queen made a 3 and then converted a three-point play during an 11-0 run that made it 19-11 with eight minutes left in the first half and the Aggies (2-1) led the rest of the way. They took a 30-25 lead into halftime, opened the second half with an 8-0 run and led by 19 after Williams made a 3 with 8:54 to play.
