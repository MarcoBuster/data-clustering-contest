        <b>The State Construction Control Bureau of Latvia (BVKB) has commenced an administrative process and plans to assess the work performed by certified construction experts on <i>Z-Towers</i>. This includes assessing reports associated with the project, as confirmed by the office’s representative Elīna Balgalve.</b>
      </p>
      <p>She explains that the project <i>Z-Towers</i> had commenced well before the establishment of BVKB and, in accordance with requirements of the Construction Law, Riga City Construction Office is responsible for supervising this project. Riga City Construction Office is also the one who will have to commission the object once it’s finished.</p>
      <p>Considering the publicly reported information, BVKB has received an order from Economy Minister Ralfs Nemiro to evaluate reports from examinations of the project and provide conclusions based on results of the examination, said Balgalve.</p>
      <h3>This is why BVKB has commenced an administrative process. The plan is assessing the work done by certified professionals, as well as previously submitted reports.</h3>
      <p><i>Z-Towers</i> project developer <i>SIA Towers Construction Management</i> commercial director Andžejs Neguliners notes that developers are happy with BVKB’s decision to perform assessment of building schematics and post-examination report assessment.</p>
      <p>«<i>Tower Construction Management</i> turned to law enforcement authorities and Economy Ministry with a request to look into this situation. We are happy that state institutions have reacted operatively,» he said.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, at the beginning of November Riga City Construction Office head Inguss Vircavs sent a letter to Riga City Council deputies in which he criticized Oļegs Burovs for exacting pressure on workers of the construction office to ensure they approve the commissioning of Z-Towers.</p>
