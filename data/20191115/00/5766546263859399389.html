      <p><b>SONGDO – South</b><b>Korea –</b> The Government of Liberia has made a major leap in attracting donor supports to address environmental and climate change challenges, improve the quality of living for Liberians and give a boost to the economy. On Thursday, November 14, 2019  at the 24<sup>th</sup> Session of the Board of Directors of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in Songdo, South Korea, Liberia was overwhelmingly selected to host the GCF Board Meeting on February 5-7 2020.</p>
      <p>GCF is a new global fund created to support the efforts of developing countries to respond to the challenge of climate change. The GCF helps developing countries limit or reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to the impact of climate change. It was set up by 194 countries who are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2010, as part of the Convention’s financial mechanism. It aims to deliver equal amount of funding to mitigation and adaptation while being guided by the Convention’s principles and provisions.</p>
      <p>While the Green Climate Fund Informal Board Meeting will focus primarily on finalizing the Fund four year Strategic Plan, it will offer a perfect opportunity for Liberia to engage with World Bank, UNDP, African Development Bank, European Union, IFAD and other development partners how to scale up Climate Action in Liberia consistent with UN Secretary-General call for ambition climate Action to support vulnerable communities and people.</p>

      <p>The GCF is governed by a Board of 24 members representing developed and developing countries equally. Therefore, Liberia’s selection will bring together about 300 international guests into the country which will attract enormous economic benefits in the country, amidst visible impact of climate change in Liberia. The Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia (EPA) in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) submitted a funding proposal to the GCF for the Monrovia Metropolitan Climate Resilient Project (MMCRP ). The Board will decide on the grant support under which seeks to address the coastal erosion problem in West Point Community in the tune of about $40 million grant.   </p>
      <p>It can be recalled in July 2018, President of Liberia, Dr. George M. Weah together with the Legislature and Cabinet Ministers agreed sourcing funding to address the impact of climate Change on the Liberia shores while contributing to achieving sustainable development.</p>
      <p>The Government of Liberia through the EPA welcomed the decision of the global community (Green Climate Fund, a Financial Mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and looks forward receiving the Board members &amp; Alternates, Advisers, Secretariat Staff and International Guests to Liberia. </p>
