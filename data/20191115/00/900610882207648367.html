      <p>Jet Privilege Private Limited (JPPL), the company which owns the frequent flyer programme of the grounded Jet Airways, has revamped its business model and corporate brand. JPPL will now be known as Inter Miles.</p>
      <p>The programme will offer its 10 million members the opportunity to earn and redeem Inter Miles, across travel, hospitality and lifestyle services across over ten categories and 150 programme partners.</p>
      <p>JPPL was set up as a separate, independent entity — part of the Etihad Aviation Group — which holds 50.1 per cent stake. Jet Airways has a minority stake of 49.9 per cent — formed to market, develop and grow Jet Privilege – a loyalty and rewards programme.</p>
      <p>After Jet Airways was grounded in April this year, JPPL had said that the JPmiles that could be redeemed only with Jet Airways, Etihad or a few associate airlines for hotel stays, fuel and 2,500 plus merchandise options on the Jet Privilege Reward Store.</p>
      <p>Manish Dureja, managing director, Jet Privilege said:</p>
      <p>“We are embarking on a new journey with Inter Miles. What started as a frequent flyer programme has, today, become the platform of choice that empowers our members to fulfill their travel and lifestyle aspirations.</p>
      <p>“As we reinforce our commitment to the promise of making our members’ journey more fulfilling, our growth plan is focused on aggregating more benefits and simplifying access to a growing bouquet of experiences and rewards.”</p>
