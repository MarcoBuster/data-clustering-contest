      <h1>Shanghala, Esau remain MPs</h1>

      <p>SWAPO Secretary-General Sophia Shaningwa has told the Windhoek Observer that the party’s leadership is still to meet to deliberate on the political future of disgraced former ministers Bernhard Esau and Sakeus Shanghala.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Windhoek Observer in a brief interview on Thursday, Shaningwa said the two ministers remain SWAPO MPs and have not been replaced from the party’s Parliamentary list.</p>
      <p>“The leadership did not discuss that situation and position to be taken,” was all that Shaningwa was prepared to say before she hung up the phone.</p>
      <p>While Esau and Shanghala opted to resign from their ministerial positions before they could be fired by President Hage Geingob on Wednesday following allegations of corruption and money-laundering in the Namibian fishing industry, the two are still clinging on to their Parliamentary seats.</p>
      <p>As of Thursday evening, the two had not resigned as Members of Parliament and will remain so until March next year if the party does not force them to step down.</p>
      <p>Both Shanghala and Esau also continue to be on the SWAPO Party’s Parliamentary list where they are ranked 53 and 33, respectively.</p>
      <p>Political analyst Professor Henning Melber said the decision by Esau and Shanghala to resign following media reports of their alleged corrupt activities is a perfect example of “too little too late”.</p>
      <p>He said the two ministers should not have been offered the opportunity to resign and make some noble statements as in the case of Esau, who suggested that he was an innocent victim of a smear campaign.</p>
      <p>“It is no longer for them to influence the discourse. It should be for them to face the consequences of their behaviour,” Melber said. </p>
      <p>“They should have been sacked unceremoniously long ago. Their dubious business practices are nothing new. The current administration and other previous administrations tolerate graft and misappropriation of funds as long as these crimes are not made public. And even when they are known in the public sphere, the consequences are taken half-heartedly.”</p>
      <p>Melber said given the seriousness of the allegations against Shanghala and Esau and what seems to be overwhelming evidence, the two ministers should have been suspended from all party related mandates and positions with immediate effect, including their status as MPs and as members in the central committee.</p>
      <p>“This is not tantamount to a guilty verdict which needs to be a matter in the court, but a consequence of their behaviour which provokes sufficient suspicions of wrongdoing and requires further criminal investigations and a case in court.</p>
      <p>“In contrast, President Geingob reportedly accepted their resignations and expressed his gratitude for their patriotism and service! This is outrageous. They should have been reprimanded in no uncertain terms and publicly named and shamed by the head of state for their unpatriotic behaviour and for bringing Namibia into international news - not least through a documentary revealingly so titled “Anatomy of a Bribe” to be broadcasted by Al Jazeera on 1 December.”</p>
      <p>Melber said President Geingob should not be surprised if this scandal will have greater impact on voter behaviour in the forthcoming elections than any campaign by opposition parties.</p>
      <p>“He could have acted much earlier in anticipation. The writing was on the wall long enough and neither Shanghala nor Esau violated fundamental ethics for the first time,” he said. – This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</p>
