      <p>Naija News reports that masked men, armed with sophisticated weapons on Friday, broke into a hotel in Lokoja, Kogi State where <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/seyi-makinde/"><u>Governor Seyi Makinde</u></a></b> of Oyo state was lodged.</p>
      <p>The armed men, wearing police uniforms reportedly arrived at the hotel where Governor Makinde and some other PDP leaders are lodged around 12.50 pm.</p>
      <p>The report gathered by <b>Naija News</b> says some of the gunmen scaled the fence of the hotel to gain access and attempted to attack the Governor and others with him.</p>
      <p>According to a statement signed and released by <b>Taiwo Adisa</b>, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, the attempt was however resisted by security details of the governor who were also assisted by some residents of the area.</p>
