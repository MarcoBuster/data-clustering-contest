      <p>Wololo! If that just gave you nerd chills, then you are definitely an Age of Empires fan and can still remember those priests from the original game. It has been a very long time since we saw a new entry in the franchise (the fourth entry was announced at Gamescom 2017) and now, at X019, Microsoft has shown off the first-ever gameplay of Age of Empires 4.</p>

      <p>The Age of Empires 4 gameplay trailer can be viewed at the bottom of this article. The game is being created by World’s Edge, a new studio created specifically for the Age of Empires franchise. The Age of Empires 4 gameplay trailer revealed by World’s Edge and Microsoft at X019 shows off the game’s medieval setting and it looks fantastic, but the developer was quick to explain this is pre-alpha footage.</p>
      <p>In Age of Empires 4, players will be able to experience the “epic, historic battles that shaped the modern world”. Adam Isgreen, the Creative Director of the Age of Empires Franchise, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/11/14/x019-age-of-empires-update/">explains</a> that:</p>
      <blockquote>We know that our community has been eager to learn more about Age of Empires IV since we announced it at Gamescom in 2017. We’ve been hard at work on the game and we’re excited to share some of it with the world today. As part of Inside Xbox, live from X019 in London, we revealed a first look at the game with an all-new trailer. We hope we’ve given you enough to discuss and theorize! As the footage said, we’re pre-Alpha. So while we’ve come a long way, we will continue to put in our best work to ensure it lives up to the Age of Empires name.</blockquote>
      <p>At the time of writing, there is no release date for Age of Empires IV. However, Microsoft and World’s Edge have just released Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition for those on PC and Xbox One to enjoy.</p>
