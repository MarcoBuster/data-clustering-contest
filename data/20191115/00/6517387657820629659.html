      <p>The Script take the top spot on this week’s Official Albums Chart as their new record, Sunsets &amp; Full Moons lands straight in at Number 1.</p>
      <p>The collection opens with 32,000 chart sales to earn the band their fifth chart-topping album in the UK. Their only album to miss the top spot was 2012’s #3, which peaked at Number 2. They do however scoop the “double hat-trick” in their native Ireland where Sunsets &amp; Full Moons has today become the Dubliners sixth consecutive <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/irish-albums-chart/">Irish Number 1</a>.</p>
      <p>Sunsets &amp; Full Moons includes the single The Last Time, which last month became the trio’s eleventh Top 40 single. <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/4040/script/">View The Script's full Official UK Chart history here</a>.</p>
