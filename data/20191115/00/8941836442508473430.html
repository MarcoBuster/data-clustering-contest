      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - NBA fans will soon be able to look up at the big videoboard above the court and get a different look at that deep Trae Young 3-pointer early in the first quarter. Or see a different perspective of that monstrous Giannis Antetokounmpo dunk.</p>
      <p>In a reversal of roles, NBA teams are bringing the video game experience back to the live action - one arena at a time.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Atlanta Hawks</a> Friday will become the fifth NBA team to unveil significant financial investments into new 360-degree replay technology designed to eventually give fans the power to change the way they see the game.</p>

      <p>“It’s the wave of the future,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a> vice-president of live experience Joe Abercrombie, who says the technology also is “one more thing to give people a reason to come” to the arena.</p>
      <p>The Bucks, Mavericks, Pacers, Wizards and now the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a> are using the technology to package and replay highlights in the arena during games. The Bulls, who host the 2020 All-Star game, are scheduled to come online next month.</p>

      <p>“It’s very nice. I especially like that up-above view,” said Allen Hazlett a fan from New Berlin, Wisconsin, after seeing the new technology at Thursday night’s Bulls-Bucks game in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s an added benefit for the fans. For those that aren’t here all the time, to see that, I think, really ups the fan experience for them. I don’t think people realize until you go somewhere else and you don’t see it how lucky we are to have this arena. Everything here is state of the art.”</p>
      <p>The six teams have joined NBA partner Intel, which provides the technology for the new video replays. The process begins with 38 5K video cameras strategically located around arenas. The high-tech cameras work together, bringing 360-degree replays to in-game video boards, TV broadcasts and fans’ devices through social media.</p>
      <p>It’s the latest effort by teams to entice ticket-buying fans to come to new and renovated NBA arenas. Atlanta spent almost $200 million to renovate State Farm Arena; <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> last year opened its $477 Fiserv Forum.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“For us it was really a no-brainer,” said Matt Pazaras, the Bucks’ senior vice president for business development and strategy.</p>
        <p>“There’s nothing like seeing a Giannis dunk live, and if we can supplement that experience with this technology, great. But if people are experiencing the Bucks wherever they are, hours away or thousands of miles away, we can still make the experience better.”</p>
        <p>NFL fans already have seen 360 replays on TV. Those replays start from the traditional side camera before swinging around to bring the viewer behind the quarterback.</p>
        <p>Not that the NFL was first in line.</p>
        <p>Gamers have been manipulating all-angle replays for years. Video game-savvy kids may roll their eyes when their parents come home from NBA games eager to share their stories about their first looks at 360-degree replays.</p>
        <p>Those video games were designed to mimic the real games. Now it’s time for some role-reversal.</p>
        <p>Rich Green, Intel’s director of sports, said popular video games Madden NFL 19 and NBA 2K20 “have camera angles and if you do replays, you can spin the camera around.”</p>
        <p>Added Green: “Now we’re going to have that in live games. Now they can watch their favorite player and follow just him. It increases their level of engagement.”</p>
        <p>The new technology isn’t just for the fans.</p>
        <p>Coaches and scouts can make use of the enhanced replays to improve player evaluations.</p>
        <p>“I think the future of this is going to weigh heavy for basketball operations and player development,” Abercrombie said.</p>
        <p>Players now have better tools to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. Abercrombie said players who take dozens of shots in a practice can now study their shooting form in a new way.</p>
        <p>“Players have asked ‘Can I shootaround and you take a look at the way I’m shooting and I want to spin around and take a look at the way I’m releasing,’” he said. “You think about traditional coverage of a game, there’s only four angles. Two on the floor and two up.</p>
        <p>“When you think about 360 view and repetitive shooting over and over again, they can say ‘Oh, I see where my tendencies are.’”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a> CEO Steve Koonin, a former executive at Turner Entertainment, says TV sports leaders have dreamed for years of the day fans could control the way they watch a game.</p>
        <p>“We’ve been reading for years that ‘You can be the director,’” Koonin said. “Actually, you can do that with this. The capabilities are unbelievable. … We think it’s the next generation of sports media.”</p>
        <p>Green said there is more to come as new ways to utilize the technology will be found that are not yet possible.</p>
        <p>Green said such high-tech terms as “voxels” - similar to pixels in the 3D age - and “volumetric video” will become common. He said fans will be able to follow a game from the viewpoint of their favorite player.</p>
        <p>“How you watch a play could be completely different from how I watch it based on how we control what angle we want to see,” Green said. “That’s why we’re just scratching the surface.”</p>
