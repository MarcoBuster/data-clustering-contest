      <p>The holiday season is on the way, meaning that you might be thinking of entertaining guests. With so many opportunities to host on the way, it might be about time to finally revamp your kitchen. Sure, a full renovation could set you back a few thousand dollars, but swapping out a few pieces of furniture is relatively easy, and a whole lot cheaper. In fact, it’s even cheaper than usual thanks to a series of pre-Black Friday deals. Create a new centerpiece and storage solution with a kitchen island, switch up your seating with new barstools, or find a new heart of your home through a fresh kitchen table. With deals from Target, Amazon, Wayfair and Macy’s you’ll be able to get all three.</p>

      <p>If you want a cart that’s relatively versatile yet still easy to move around, this might be the way to go. The cart comes with a nice wooden top, along with a white, red or black exterior that should look great in any home. There’s even space on the side for spices, shakers and other things that you don’t want falling off. Usually $289.99, this cart is a steal at $199.99.</p>

        <figcaption>Home Styles 5412-94Q Tahoe Kitchen Island</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Adding this island into a room with cabinets in the same aged maple finish, it will look like it’s been apart of the design for years. The island will look equally as beautiful paired with contrasting cabinets. Most kitchen carts have an open-air feel, but this one is completely closed to keep all clutter concealed. Four smaller drawers can hold utensils and two larger drawers and a cabinet can store small kitchen appliances and cookware. What sets this island apart from others is the additional 12-inch leaf that can be used as a bar for additional seating or as added workspace. Originally on sale for $1,499, now on sale for $862.03.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This cart provides exactly the pop of color your kitchen needs. The fun mint hue is subtle but can still brighten your day. Just shy of 30 inches wide, this cart can easily store a microwave, toaster or other small appliance on its surface, which also doubles as great prep space. Below the cart is already compartmentalized into designated storage sections. Five-spice racks, four bottle holders and two shelves for dishes and glassware should do the trick and keep your space organized. Originally on sale for $239.99, now on sale for $197.99.</p>

        <figcaption>Vahan 26'' Counter Stool, Quick Ship</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Add a little touch of glam to your morning routine with these chic stools sitting at your breakfast nook. These counter height bar stools bring an element of luxury to the table—literally and figuratively—with the gold-tone metal accents and the rich upholstery. The low back and clean line design, however, are also a minimalist’s dream. The multi-leg base makes this stool a little less formal than a traditional barstool with one single leg, making it suitable for everyday use at a kitchen island. Originally on sale for $479, now on sale for $289.</p>
