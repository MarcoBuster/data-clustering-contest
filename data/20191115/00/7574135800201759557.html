      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-feelies-playing-first-2-lps-in-full-at-jersey-city-show-more-upcoming-dates/"><b>The Feelies (playing <i>Crazy Rhythms / The Good Earth</i>) @ White Eagle Hall</b></a><br/>One of the great New York area bands of the last 40 years, The Feelies are still amazing and any chance to see them should be considered. Tonight’s show is special, as they’ll be playing their first two albums in full. They’ll probably play at least one more set of other material — and lots of covers — as well, plus an encore.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/taking-back-sunday-announce-2019-starland-ballroom-holiday-shows/"><b>Taking Back Sunday, Errortype:11 @ Terminal 5</b></a><br/>Taking Back Sunday’s 20th anniversary tour hits Terminal 5 tonight and tomorrow, and they’ll play their classic debut <i>Tell All Your Friends</i> in full both nights, plus <i>Where You Want To Be</i> one night and <i>Louder Now</i> the other. Making these shows extra appealing is support from the back-in-action Errortype:11, who hailed from the same Long Island hardcore scene that helped birth TBS. This is night one.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/black-mountain-on-tour-including-dates-with-graveyard-majeure-ryley-walker/"><b>Black Mountain, Ryley Walker @ Bowery Ballroom</b></a><br/>Black Mountain remain excellent blenders of ’70s hard rock, modern indie rock, and psychedelia, as evidenced by this year’s very solid <i>Destroyer</i>. Support comes from jammy indie rocker Ryley Walker.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/listen-to-trsts-the-destroyer-title-track/"><b>TR/ST, Light Asylum, Total Freedom, Christeene, SRSQ @ Knockdown Center</b></a><br/>Canada’s TR/ST released two albums this year and have put together a killer night for fans of dark synthpop, with Brookyn’s own Light Asylum as the undercard.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/david-byrne-now-on-broadway-cast-recording-released-check-out-an-opening-night-video/"><b>David Byrne’s American Utopia @ Hudson Theatre</b></a><br/>David Byrne has retooled his acclaimed “untethered” 2018 for the Broadway stage and while the setlist and arrangements are much like what they were on his tour, songs are now threaded together with new monologues from Byrne, making for a much more theatrical experience.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-ergs-touring-for-the-15th-anniversary-of-dorkrockcorkrod-including-riot-fest/"><b>The Ergs!, Big Eyes, Chris Gethard, Weird Skin @ Brooklyn Bazaar</b></a><br/>Cult pop punks The Ergs! are doing a rare tour for the 15th anniversary of their debut album <i>dorkrockcorkrod</i>.

      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/modern-life-is-war-leeway-playing-kingsland-2-year-anniversary-shows/"><b>Leeway @ The Kingsland</b></a><br/>The Kingsland opened in 2018 and it has quickly become one of Brooklyn’s better punk and metal venues. It celebrates its two-year anniversary with NYHC vets Leeway tonight and Iowa melodic hardcore greats Modern Life Is War tomorrow.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/remember-sports-reissuing-sunchokes-playing-it-on-tour-watch-a-new-video/"><b>Remember Sports, Lisa Prank @ Rough Trade</b></a><br/>Indie pop punks Remember Sports are celebrating the fifth anniversary of their debut album <i>Sunchokes</i> (released back when they were just called Sports) with a reissue and a short tour that sees them playing the album in full. Likeminded artist Lisa Prank opens.</p>
      <p><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/2019/11/15/mortician-funerus-sacrificial-blood-sick-bay"><b>Mortician, Funerus, Sacrificial Blood, Sick Bay @ Saint Vitus</b></a><br/>Yonkers deathgrind vets Mortician turned 30 this year, and they’re celebrating with anniversary shows on the East Coast, including this hometown-area show tonight.</p>

Bey says that <i>Negus</i> will not be released in any digital or analog mediums and can only be heard at galleries and here contains all new material that has been uniquely arranged for the Brooklyn Museum.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/schitts-creek-cast-going-on-up-close-personal-tour-this-fall/"><b>Schitt’s Creek: Up Close and Personal @ Kings Theatre (two shows)</b></a><br/>As riches-to-rags sitcom <i>Schitt’s Creek</i> heads into its sixth and final season, the series creators/stars Eugene Levy and Dan Levy, along with other cast members, are presenting “Schitt’s Creek: Up Close &amp; Personal” for a “live, interactive evening that promises to be fun and insightful while giving fans an insider’s look into the making of the series.”</p>
