      <p>Among other things, Irena Wojcik, 51, a physical therapy assistant, was repeatedly called “grandma” by her boss, told a “dynamic” clinic needs “young people,” and subjected to a team-building event based on the American Ninja Warrior theme.But that’s not the worst thing that happened to Wojcik.</p>
      <p>She was dismissed in 2017 after working for five years at <a href="http://www.memorialhermann.org/locations/texas-medical-center/">Memorial Hermann Health System of Houston, TX</a>, in a questionable “reduction in force” and filed a lawsuit alleging age discrimination and retaliation.  Senior U.S. District Judge Gray H. Hiller granted Memorial Hermann’s pre-trial motion to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-txsd-4_17-cv-03198/pdf/USCOURTS-txsd-4_17-cv-03198-0.pdf">summarily dismiss</a> Wojcik’s case.</p>
      <p>That’s not even the worst thing that happened to her.</p>
      <p>Memorial Hermann, which reportedly had $5.06 billion in operating revenue in 2017, handed Wojcik a bill to pay its costs. On Nov. 8, Judge Hiller overruled Wojcik’s objections and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-txsd-4_17-cv-03198/pdf/USCOURTS-txsd-4_17-cv-03198-2.pdf">ordered her to pay</a> the hospital a total of $3,000.69.</p>
      <p>So Wojcik suffered the repeated humiliation of ageism, lost her job after she complained about it and ended up in debt because she had the effrontery to ask the U.S. District Court to enforce her right under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to be free from illegal age discrimination.</p>
      <h3>GO FUND ME?</h3>
      <p>Wojcik’s attorney, Josh Verde, said Friday that she has since found another job but it is “not lucrative” and paying $3000 in fees to Memorial Hermann will “definitely sting.” Verde said he has discussed the possibility of helping Wojcik pay Memorial Hermann’s bill by creating a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/c/how-it-works">“Go Fund Me”</a> page on her behalf and soliciting donations.</p>
      <p>Verde has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to overturn Judge Hiller’s dismissal of the case.</p>
      <p>In his order, Judge Hiller writes that Memorial Hermann was entitled to costs because the Fifth Circuit holds that “reducing or eliminating a prevailing party’s cost award based on its wealth – either relative or absolute – is impermissible as a matter of law.”</p>
      <p>In a footnote, Hiller rejects Wojcik argument that age discrimination is a matter of “public importance” and that “award of costs against Plaintiff would have a chilling effect on future age discrimination cases.” Hiller writes these arguments are “simply iterations of Wojcik’s economic disparity argument.”</p>
      <p>Hiller did reduce Memorial Hermann’s original bill by $1,328.50, mainly because Memorial Hermann failed to justify the need for holding a video deposition of Wojcik.</p>
      <h3>New Supervisor</h3>
      <p>As in so many age discrimination cases, Wojcik alleges in her complaint that her troubles began in 2015 when she began working for a new and inexperienced supervisor, Tamara “Nikki” Shelton, the manager of the hospital’s Bellaire Clinic.</p>
      <p>Wojcik states she was frequently reduced to tears by Shelton’s comments and her laughter with younger employees about Wojcik’s age.  At one point, a patient brought Wojcik a cup of green tea from Starbucks “and informed Wojcik that Shelton had requested the tea stating, ‘bring Irena some green tea. She’s old and it will be good for her.’”</p>
      <p>Wojcik in May 2017 told Shelton the age-related comments and actions made her uncomfortable, caused her distress, made work difficult and “she wanted them to stop.” Thereafter, her schedule was changed, many of her patients were transferred to other physical therapy assistants, and she was further isolated.</p>
      <p>Wojcik states she was dismissed two months later in a sham reduction in force. She writes that Memorial Hermann refused to transfer her to alternate job positions for which she was qualified and was  “actively recruiting for ‘Physical Therapy Assistants’” in the Houston area.</p>
      <p>Judge Hiller methodically eliminated each of Wojcik’s claims.</p>
      <p>He said she established a prima facie case of age discrimination but Memorial Hermann successfully articulated a “legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the layoff, i.e., the reduction in force.” Hiller said another hospital official, Tim Couture, executed the layoff based on the “operational performance of the facility.”</p>
      <p>Hiller states that Wojcik submitted a complaint to Memorial Hermann’s Compliance Helpline “indicating that she believed Dr. Shelton was terminating her employment because of her age.” However, Hiller said Wojcik failed to show that Shelton was involved in the reduction in force decision.</p>
      <p>Hiller acknowledges that Wojcik claims that “both Shelton and Couture intentionally deleted work-related communications from their mobile devices” but states “this is not an issue before the court.”</p>
      <p>Hiller rejected evidence that Wojcik’s position was not actually eliminated. He concedes Shelton requested that a younger physical therapy assistant be transferred to Shelton’s team after Wojcik’s departure but states the employee in question ultimately was not transferred to Shelton’s team.</p>
      <p>Judge Hiller concluded that no reasonable jury would find that Wojcik was a victim of age discrimination by Memorial Hermann.</p>
