      <p>Wraps that can be worn at home or away are one of the most popular accessories and gifts. The variety is endless but my preference tends to be the non-itchy variety in the softest, best quality cashmere. Here are eight of the best brands producing versatile wraps that are certain to please.<a href="https://www.thetravelwrapcompany.com/"><b>The Travelwrap Company</b></a></p>

      <p>The cashmere wraps from the <a href="https://www.thetravelwrapcompany.com/classic-mulberry-cashmere-travelwrap.html">Travelwrap Company</a> are so soft, beautiful and comforting that they’re ideal for daily wear as well as being a stylish and practical essential for travel. During her previous career in the pharmaceutical industry, Niamh Barker, the brand’s founder, traveled a lot and felt squeamish using airplane blankets, a known source of germs. Thus, a company that exclusively produces travelwraps was born. The wraps are produced by <a href="https://www.johnstonsofelgin.com/retail/">Johnstons of Elgin</a>, a 200-year-old Scottish company that has a well-deserved reputation for producing the finest cashmere in the world. <a href="https://www.thetravelwrapcompany.com/classic-mulberry-cashmere-travelwrap.html">The Mulberry</a> (£197), a generously sized wrap, part of the classic collection, in deep violet, is on my gift list and there are a wide range of colors, designs, knits and weights to suit all tastes. And, new this autumn is the men’s range with a silver grey two-ply cashmere piece (£229) sure to be a popular choice. For holiday gifts, take advantage of the bespoke monogramming and gift wrapping services.</p>
