      <p>‘<i>an intrinsic part of my artistic process is interpreting the landscape, history, and essence of a unique region through my sculptural language,</i>‘ <b>explains <a href="https://fernandomastrangelo.com/">fernando mastrangelo</a>.</b> ‘<i>I’m incredibly humbled to have the opportunity with dubai and the capital collection. if the pieces capture or translate even a fraction of dubai’s intensity and beauty, I’d consider that a success.</i>’</p>

      <p>each mirror of fernando mastrangelo’s capital collection reflects a specific character that defines dubai. warm and rich in color, <b>‘sahara’</b> references the city’s famed, intense sun and sand. it appears as if a jewel, with its pure yellow sand drifting across its golden, highly polished mirror surface.</p>

      <p><b>‘marina’</b> defines a distinct contrast between its two elements. as a homage to the city’s important waterways, the piece reflects the relationship between this water and dubai’s man-made cityscape. dark, hand-shaped terrain progressively encroaches across the deep, mesmerizing blue of the mirror.</p>

      <p>lastly, <b>‘aurora’</b> celebrates the unique, vibrancy of the sunsets seen in dubai. a clear mirror is intersected by a spectrum of white, pink and purple tones. the colorscape commands attention, evoking a sense of warmth and an ever-present fondness to the city’s beautiful nature.</p>
