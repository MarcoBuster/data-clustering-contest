      <h1>An ambassador fired: What to watch on Day 2 of impeachment</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - An ambassador, her firing and a pair of fixers.</p>
      <p>Those details stand at the center of Marie Yovanovitch’s story, a personal ordeal she’ll relate to Americans and the world Friday as part of the Democrat-driven impeachment inquiry against President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>What led to the career diplomat’s firing, Democrats say, is a key chapter in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s holdup of military aid while he pressured <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> to investigate Joe Biden’s son. Republicans dismiss that as not credible.</p>

      <p>THEY CALL HER MASHA</p>
      <p>Expect to hear extensive details about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>’s biography as Democrats seek to bolster her credibility and suggest that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> fired her for being a little too effective at her job.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>She had twice served as an ambassador - to the Kyrgyz Republic and to Armenia - before being confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> in a Senate voice vote in July 2016. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>, 60, testified on Oct. 11 that she was told that people were “looking to hurt” her. One senior <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> official said she needed to “watch my back.” Asked in the private session whether she felt threatened, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>After her firing, more of the story began to come out. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> said she was told that the State Department had been under pressure from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> to remove her from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> since the summer of 2018. At the heart of it was president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who told Ukrainian journalists that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> was pulled from Kyiv because she was part of efforts against the president.</p>
        <p>During the private deposition last month, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> grew emotional and asked for a break, according to the transcript.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> is a career diplomat who served as a principal deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, a senior adviser and the dean of the language school at the Foreign Service Institute. She is now working as a senior State Department fellow at Georgetown University.</p>

        <p>TRUMP CALLED HER “THE WOMAN”</p>
        <p>Watch how <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> and the president’s defenders - and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> himself - interact during her testimony.</p>
        <p>The president had fired <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> months before the July 25th phone call in which he pressured <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s president on the Bidens. Even though she had been gone for months, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> clearly was on the president’s mind and connected to his goals in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>. He says he was rooting out corruption generally.</p>
        <p>“The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> said, according to the rough transcript of the call with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “She’s going to go through some things.”</p>
        <p>It’s unclear what he meant. But the president with a long history of denigrating women who stand up to him says the call was “perfect.”</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>RUDY’S FIXERS</p>
        <p>Listen for mention of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two associates of Giuliani’s arrested at an airport last month while trying to leave the country with one-way tickets.</p>
        <p>The businessmen are charged with making illegal campaign contributions while looking to expand their energy business in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>. The core of Giuliani’s involvement appears to revolve around his work with them.</p>
        <p>Soviet-born Parnas is prepared to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. He’s accused of using foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions while lobbying U.S. politicians to oust <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/was-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>.</p>
        <p>Parnas’s attorney, Joseph Bondy, sent lawmakers a letter saying Parnas is prepared to answer questions and produce documents for the impeachment inquiry as long as they don’t step on his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>NO PRO QUO</p>
        <p>The president and his allies insist there was “no quid pro quo,” which is Latin for, roughly, an offer of this for that.</p>
        <p>But quid pro quo is not in the Constitution. “Bribery” is specifically spelled out as a potential ground for presidential impeachment.</p>
        <p>So Democrats are shifting to “bribery” to describe <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s conduct, though it’s not yet clear whether that charge will form the basis of an article of impeachment.</p>
        <p>What’s certain is that Democrats are focused like a laser on making the case for impeachment clear to Americans in a bid to build up public support.</p>
        <p>“Quid pro quo: Bribery,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday. “The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into elections. That’s bribery.”</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>2020 LOOMS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> continued to assail the proceedings as “a hoax” on Thursday. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy dismissed the witness testimony as hearsay, at best second-hand information.</p>
        <p>The president’s re-election campaign says Americans are increasingly behind that defense.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s reelection effort raised more than $3 million on the first day of public impeachment hearings, and campaign manager Brad Parscale announced it now hopes to raise $5 million within a 24-hour span.</p>
