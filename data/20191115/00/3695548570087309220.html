        <b>Road racing dominator Peter Hickman secured pole position for Saturday's Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix despite being beaten to the fastest time in Friday morning's second qualifying session.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hickman, who has won the race three times previously, recorded a fastest time of 2m25.100s in Friday afternoon's opening qualifying session.</p>
      <p>That effort initially put him more than two seconds clear of the rest of the field around the 3.8-mile Guia circuit, and even after his rivals had improved their times in that session the Bathams BMW rider remained 1.7s ahead.</p>
      <p>And though Hickman's efforts to improve in Saturday morning's 45-minute second session were thwarted by traffic, meaning he was beaten by both team-mate Michael Rutter and the Ducati Panigale V4 R of David Johnson, his initial time was still good enough to seal pole by two tenths.</p>

      <p>Eight-time winner Rutter went significantly quicker than he had previously on his final lap of the second session, sealing second with a 2m25.382s lap on his Honda RC213V-S, while Johnson ended up third, close to a second off Hickman's pace.</p>
      <p>Johnson's Paul Bird Motorsport team-mate John McGuinness - riding a Ducati for the first time this season in the event where he returned from a two-year injury spell last year - will start fourth, having spent much of the second session in the top three, ahead of Lee Johnston's Ashcourt Racing BMW.</p>
      <p>Austrian rider Horst Saiger was sixth on his Yamaha ahead of Erno Kostamo (BMW).</p>
      <p>Ian Hutchinson, who is racing at Macau for the first time since 2016, was 10th in the second qualifying session after lapping close to four seconds slower than Rutter.</p>
      <p>The weekend marks 16-time Isle of Man TT winner Hutchinson's first race outing since the 2019 edition of the TT, having skipped the Ulster Grand Prix to have his leg operated on.</p>
