      <h1>S&amp;P 500 notches record, shakes off Cisco's gloomy outlook</h1>
      <h2>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.63 points, or 0.01 percent, to 27,781.96, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.59 points, or 0.08 percent, to 3,096.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.08 points, or 0.04 percent, to 8,479.02.</h2>

      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 stock index posted a slim gain to end with a record closing high on Thursday, as a dour forecast from tech stalwart Cisco Systems was offset by a strong report from big box retailer Walmart.</p>
      <p>The Dow index ended barely negative, after posting a closing high on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq also ended fractionally lower.</p>
      <p>Cisco shares tumbled 7.3 percent after the network gear maker forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below expectations as increasing global economic uncertainties kept clients away from spending more on its routers and switches.</p>

      <p>Cisco’s share decline weighed the most on the major indexes and helped drag the technology sector down 0.1 percent.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Walmart raised its annual outlook, and the world’s largest retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, comparable sales and e-commerce growth in its largest market during the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Walmart shares fell 0.3 percent after hitting a record high earlier in the session, but the S&amp;P 500 retail and consumer discretionary indexes finished higher after the company’s report.</p>
      <p>“We have on display this front end of the economy, the US consumer, that remains resilient and remains in a healthy place in front of a very key holiday spending time frame for the economy,” said Margaret Reid, senior portfolio manager at The Private Bank at Union Bank in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>That compares, Reid said, to “the back end of the economy that still seems to be plagued and weighed by US-China trade and global economic and political volatility.”</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.63 points, or 0.01 percent, to 27,781.96, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.59 points, or 0.08 percent, to 3,096.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.08 points, or 0.04 percent, to 8,479.02.</p>
      <p>Stocks have recently run to all-time highs, helped by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts, third-quarter earnings topping low expectations, and signs the economy may be bottoming.</p>
      <p>Third-quarter corporate reporting season is drawing to a close with about three-fourths of S&amp;P 500 companies posting profits above expectations, but with earnings expected to have declined 0.4% overall from the year-earlier period, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>“The market is kind of in a holding pattern,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “It seems like it has gotten everything it can get out of this earnings season.”</p>
      <p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the risk of the US economy facing a dramatic bust is remote, and investors will next be looking to US retail sales data on Friday to gauge the health of the economy.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, real estate was the top-performing S&amp;P 500 sector, rising 0.8 percent, while energy and consumer staples lagged along with tech.</p>
      <p>Dillard’s Inc shares jumped 14.2 percent after the department store chain’s quarterly results.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favoured decliners.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 121 new lows.</p>
      <p>About 6.3 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, below the 6.9 billion-share daily average over the last 20 sessions.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
