      <p>Unionized workers at four Saskatchewan Crown corporations and the Water Security Agency have ratified new contracts.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Donna Harpauer says sheâ€™s pleased the workers at the water agency as well as SaskTel, SaskEnergy, SaskPower, SaskWater voted in favour of the deal after a 17-day strike.</p>
      <p>Wages are frozen for the first two years of all contracts but SaskTel employees get a five per cent increase over five years.</p>
      <p>Workers at SaskEnergy, SaskWater and SaskPower get seven per cent over six years and water agency workers get six per cent over six years.</p>
      <p>SecurTek and DirectWest, both subsidiaries of SaskTel, signed their own agreements at the end of October.</p>
      <p>Unifor says the new agreement includes a net increase higher than the five per cent cap originally offered by the province.</p>
