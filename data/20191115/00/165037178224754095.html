        <b>Thoughts of Liverpool's title bid will be parked until after Netherlands duty has been completed for Virgil van Dijk.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/v-van-dijk-107732/">Virgil van Dijk</a> is<b> focused purely on ensuring Netherlands complete the job </b>and qualify for Euro 2020, not on Liverpool's Premier League title bid.</p>
      <p>The Reds<b> defeated reigning champions Manchester City</b> 3-1 at Anfield on Sunday to open up an<b> eight-point gap at the top of the table</b>, with Pep Guardiola's side nine back.</p>
      <p>Powerful centre-back Van Dijk was asked by Sky Sports whether establishing such a commanding lead made it feel like this season could see <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/liverpool/">Liverpool </a>end a 30-year wait for top-flight glory.</p>
      <p>But <b>Van Dijk will not look beyond Saturday's contest with Northern Ireland</b> in Belfast, where a point will be enough for Netherlands to book their place in the Euros.</p>
      <p>"I'm not gonna say that [it feels like Liverpool's year]," he said. </p>
      <p>"It's something for the media. <b>For players the main thing is we focus on the game ahead of us". </b></p>

      <p>"For me personally<b> it's Northern Ireland,</b> it's a tough task.<b> What happens with Liverpool in the future we'll see</b>, we have no influence on it, the season is so long. <b>My focus is on the next game</b>, at the moment that's [with our] national teams."</p>

      <p>Van Dijk could be joined in the Premier League by<b> international team-mate Memphis Depay,</b> with the Lyon forward<b> linked with a move to Tottenham or a return to Manchester United.</b></p>
      <p>Depay endured an unhappy <b>18-month stay at Old Trafford </b>before moving to Ligue 1 in January 2017, but Van Dijk feels <b>he would be an asset to any team.  </b></p>
      <p><b>"He's a fantastic player</b>, a very important player for our team here at the moment, wherever he goes in the near future<b> it will be a good thing for him,</b>" he added.</p>
      <p>"But he's still at Lyon at the moment you have to respect that, <b>until things happen you have to see how they go."</b></p>
