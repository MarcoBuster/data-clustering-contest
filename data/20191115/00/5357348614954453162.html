        <b>NEW Fortress Energy, in a bid to continue strengthening its philanthropic outreach in the communities in which it operates LNG terminals, recently donated 50 life jackets valued at $1.7 million to fishermen in Old Harbour Bay, St Catherine; Monymusk, Rocky Point and Salt River, Clarendon; and River Bay, St James.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the energy company, the donation cements the company's long-standing support of the island's fishing industry, which it continues to do through sponsorship of the International Fisherman's Day Conference hosted by C-CAM (Caribbean Coastal Area Management) — with this year being its third consecutive year as a sponsor.</p>
      <p>During the handing over of the life jackets at the Old Harbour Bay fishing village, Anthony Drysdale, business development and liaison officer at the Jamaica Fishermen Co-operative Union, said: “This donation is much appreciated and well-needed, especially with Jamaica being a hurricane-prone destination. I have no doubt that these life jackets will make a big difference as we at the co-operative continue to promote safety at sea with our fishermen and women.”</p>
      <p>Leon Prince, one of the fishermen attending the ceremony, said: “This is a good thing, man. The sea can get very rough at times and you never know what can happen. So, thank you very, very much for this.”</p>
      <p>These sentiments were echoed in chorus by other fishermen in attendance as they fitted their life jackets.</p>
      <p>New Fortress Energy in July unveiled the historic Floating Storage Regasification Terminal, which will supply the 190-MW power plant in Old Harbour.</p>
      <p>The company, ahead of commencing construction in St Catherine, Clarendon and St James sponsored several community projects in and around the areas in which it now operates. Some of these projects included the purchasing of equipment to facilitate skills training for unskilled youth at the Old Harbour Community Development Centre, providing back-to-school financial assistance for more than 1,000 primary school students, as well as bursaries for fifth-and sixth-form high school students.</p>
      <p>“We are deeply humbled by the show of gratitude from our fisherfolk and proud to be part of the vibrant communities that they represent,” said Verona Carter, vice-president for public affairs for New Fortress Energy.</p>
      <p>“Our fishermen and women are heroes who work tirelessly every day to create an industry that feeds the nation and, by extension, their families, and this is our way of saluting them and saying thanks for what they do,” she said.</p>
