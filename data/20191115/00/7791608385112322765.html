      <p><b>A recent bust by</b> the FBI serves as a word of caution that the most surefire ways to obtain an authentic iPhone are through your telco or directly from Apple. <br/><b>As a result</b> of a years-long investigation, the FBI have cracked down on a counterfeit ring that purportedly cost Apple over US$6.1 million. <br/><b>The syndicate focused</b> on iPhones and iPads, and had imported over 10,000 counterfeits of the smartphones and tablets from China, later deliberately damaging them so they could be exchanged at Apple Stores for genuine models. <br/><b>According to</b> a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/fourteen-indicted-6-million-counterfeit-iphones-scheme-biggest-fraud-its-kind-southern?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">press release</a> by the United States Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of California, the authentic devices would then be shipped to China or other countries at premium prices. <br/><b>14 people,</b> mostly US citizens, are believed to have been involved in the crime and now face dozens of charges for “fraud, conspiracy, identity theft and money laundering.” 11 of them have been arrested but three are still missing. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The alleged ringleaders,</b> three China-born brothers who are naturalized US citizens, were arrested along with their spouses. <br/><b>Investigators seized</b> about 90 potential counterfeit iPhones and US$250,000 in cash from the bust in San Diego on Wednesday. <br/><b>Each genuine</b> Apple iPhone and iPad has a unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and serial number attached to it. The counterfeit ring thus took IMEI and serial numbers from real devices purchased by unwitting customers and applied them to the forged devices. <br/><b>United States Attorney</b> Robert Brewer explained in the statement that the counterfeit ring “[harmed] innocent people whose identities were stolen in furtherance of these activities,” resulting in the scammers facing the multiple charges. <br/>[via <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/tech/apple-fbi-bust-counterfeit-ring-iphone-ipad/index.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">CNN Business</a>, cover image via <a href="https://shutterstock.7eer.net/c/1262811/42119/1305?u=https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/kyiv-ukraine-july-30-2019-gray-1476513917">Mykola Churpita / Shutterstock.com</a>]</p>
