      <h1>PDP Reacts As Gunmen Attack Gov. Makinde, Wada</h1>

      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday condemned the attack on Governor <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/02/why-i-stopped-road-project-awarded-by-ajimobi-makinde/"><u><b>Seyi Makinde</b></u></a> of Oyo State and the party’s Governorship candidate, Musa Wada.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/breaking-governor-makinde-attacked-in-lokoja-hotel-by-armed-masked-men/"><u>masked men, armed with sophisticated weapons on Friday, broke into a hotel in Lokoja, Kogi State where <b>Gov Makinde</b> was lodged</u></a>.</p>
      <p>The armed men, wearing police uniforms reportedly arrived at the hotel where Governor Makinde and some other PDP leaders are lodged around 12.50 pm.</p>
      <p>The report gathered by <b>Naija News</b> says some of the gunmen scaled the fence of the hotel to gain access and attempted to attack the Governor and others with him.</p>
      <p>According to a statement signed and released by <b>Taiwo Adisa</b>, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, the attempt was however resisted by security details of the governor who were also assisted by some residents of the area.</p>
      <p>Reacting in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP accused the APC of being behind the attack.</p>
      <p>The party noted that if not for the intervention of security agents it would have turned calamitous.</p>
      <p>The statement reads: <i>“It took the resistance of the security personnel attached to Governor Makinde to save the situation, which would have turned calamitous, as the people of Kogi who were around the venue were already poised for a stiff confrontation.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“APC ought to have known by now that their reliance on thugs and violence cannot thrive, as the people are ready to defend their state in this election.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We urge the Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu to caution the APC as well as put every measure in place to check the activities of APC’s thugs so as to ensure a hitch-free, transparent and credible election on Saturday.”</i>
