      <h1>Browns star Garrett facing NFL discipline after outburst</h1>

      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Myles Garrett</a> swung a helmet. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> will soon swing back at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Cleveland Browns</a> star.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> could be facing an unprecedented league suspension for his violent outburst Thursday night, when he ripped off <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pittsburgh/">Pittsburgh</a> quarterback Mason Rudolph’s helmet and clubbed him on the head during the final seconds of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland/">Cleveland</a>’s 21-7 win.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>’s shocking actions on national TV will come with a price. It’s possible the league could come down hard on the former No. 1 overall pick, who made strides in cleaning up his game after picking up some personal fouls earlier this season.</p>

      <p>Following the game, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> was contrite, but the damage was already done.</p>
      <p>“What I did was foolish, and I shouldn’t have allowed myself to slip like that,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> said softly. “It’s out of character.”</p>

      <p>It’s now out of his hands, and it’s possible the league could end <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>’s season by docking him the final six games.</p>
      <p>In 2006, Tennessee’s Albert Haynesworth was suspended five games after he stomped on Dallas Cowboys center Andre Gurode’s head. Haynesworth’s punishment is the longest for on-field behavior in league history.</p>
      <p>After pulling Rudolph down with eight seconds to go following a short pass, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> wrestled with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pittsburgh/">Pittsburgh</a>’s QB on the ground with both players grabbing at each other’s heads. When they got to their feet, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> ripped off Rudolph’s helmet and swung wildly, hitting the second-year QB on top of the head.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> was thrown to the ground by Steelers guard David DeCastro and center Maurkice Pouncey threw punches and kicked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> in the head as players from both sidelines poured onto the field in a scene that goes to the top of the list of skirmishes in the bitter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pittsburgh/">Pittsburgh</a>-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland/">Cleveland</a> rivalry.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The Steelers were livid about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>’s conduct.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know how he got to the point that it’s OK to use a helmet as a weapon,” said Steelers defensive tackle Cameron Heyward. “I know we play a sport that’s violent, but it should never have gotten handled like that. That dumb stuff shouldn’t be allowed. For someone to use a helmet as a weapon is uncalled for.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>, Pouncey and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Browns</a> defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi were ejected and all face league discipline.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Browns</a> coach Freddie Kitchens said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> apologized to him and the defensive end said he intends to talk to his teammates.</p>
        <p>“The next time I see them, I’ll address them,” he said. “I am hurting my whole team with what I did, and it could come back to bite us. I don’t know what kind of repercussion I face, but I have to be better.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Browns</a> will visit the Steelers on Nov. 14.</p>
        <p>Kitchens was disappointed with Garret for losing his cool and overshadowing a huge win for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Browns</a>, who have won two straight games to salvage a season that was starting to slip away.</p>
        <p>“You have to be able to maintain your composure in times like that and under no circumstances do we want anything to do with anything like that,” Kitchens said. “I am embarrassed. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Myles</a> is embarrassed. It is not good. He understands what he did, he understands it is totally unacceptable, and we have to get through it.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Browns</a> have been among the league’s most penalized teams, and their lack of discipline has been a poor reflection on Kitchens in his first year as coach.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland/">Cleveland</a> committed eight penalties for 121 yards against the Steelers, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Browns</a> defensive backs delivered two helmet-to-helmet blows that gave concussions to Steelers wide receivers.</p>
        <p>The second such shot was by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Browns</a> safety Damarious Randall, who lowered his head and delivered a nasty hit on Steelers rookie Diontae Johnson, who suffered a concussion and had blood coming from one ear.</p>
        <p>Kitchens took issue with the idea his team is reckless, and said he was disappointed for his other players.</p>
        <p>“We have five seconds to go in a game. That cannot happen,” he said. “We have five seconds to go in a game - the biggest game that this team has won. Never beat Baltimore and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pittsburgh/">Pittsburgh</a> in the same year since 1999, and then we have to talk about this. There are 52 other guys on the team that that hurt, and it is going to hurt moving forward. We do not condone that. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Myles</a> understands what he did wrong.”</p>
