      <p>The launch for NBA 2K20 was problematic on a few fronts, and there are still some areas of the game causing issues. However, the most consistently strong and fun mode in the game all year has been MyTeam.I’ve played the mode consistently since launch using the completionist approach (selling or auctioning only duplicates and consumable cards) and there have been very few hiccups in my enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Through the two-plus months of MyTeam gameplay, I’ve learned a lot about the mode’s single and multiplayer features. This isn’t the first year I’ve played the mode, but this is by far the most engaged I’ve ever been post-review.</p>
      <p>That continued engagement is because of the multi-layered experience MyTeam offers this year. What the mode’s designers have done is provide a balanced set of single and multiplayer options.</p>
      <p>You could play only the single-player aspects of MyTeam and remained engaged because there is so much to do. I mentioned I use the completionist approach, but others, like my son are more interested in building the best possible lineup for the MyTeam Unlimited feature. That’s a shorter-term, less-vested approach, but I can see how it might be enjoyable.</p>

      <p>Gamers who play that way never get too attached to any card as they are always willing to auction it off to add more players or assets. As a completionist, I’m looking for all of the rewards on the Collector Levels.</p>
      <p>The top reward is a Galaxy Opal Anthony Davis, which should be the most dominant card in the game. You do have to collect 2,900 cards to obtain it, and that might seem like an impossible mission–especially without forking over cash to buy boxes of packs. Granted, that will accelerate your progress toward the goal, but it’s not necessary.</p>

      <p>Between playing other modes to accumulate virtual currency and completing the single and/or multiplayer challenges in the MyTeam mode, there are a plethora of ways to earn the points to continue to add valuable cards to your collection. The single-player Triple Threat, Daily Logins, Challenges, and improved Domination allow you to stack the MT, and you never have to play another human being, unless you want to head to the multiplayer options.</p>
      <p>The MTU, Triple Threat Online and Multiplayer options just add another layer. I think the best new feature MyTeam has added are the Evolution cards. The ability to upgrade players brings the element of a side mission in a sports collector mode. The grind to evolve a card have generated the most enjoyable experiences I have with NBA 2K20. I’m currently working to evolve an Amethyst Isaiah Thomas all the way up to a Galaxy Opal. I’ve evolved a Dwyane Wade card, pictured in the lead photo, up three levels already.</p>
      <p>This entire process can be done in single-player modes. MyTeam has long been criticized as a pay-to-win mode, but I can tell you from experience, that really isn’t necessary–especially in this year’s game. More importantly, you don’t have to pay to enjoy the mode.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of negativity floating about as it pertains to NBA 2K20, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/11/12/nba-2k20-patch-8-notes-breaking-down-the-issues-with-the-latest-communication/">some of it is well earned on the publisher’s side</a>. However, this mode is a bright spot.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t given MyTeam a spin, and you already own NBA 2K20, you might want to give it a look.</p>
