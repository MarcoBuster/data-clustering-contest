      <p>In this shifting retail (and media) landscape, one thing is clear: people are craving connection. There’s a reason why more and more immersive experiences are popping up, and why traditional brick and mortar retailers are looking to implement the magic formula of IRL activations like the Museum of Ice Cream. One need only look at content-meets-commerce retailers like Camp, which features a seamless blend of play and product in what is referred to as a “family experience store” (and which has set up camp as a permanent location in New York City’s Flatiron District), and the <i>Friends</i> pop-up that opened in SoHo in honor of the landmark show’s 25th anniversary and featuring all the perks of <i>Friends</i> merch, to see that immersive experiences that play on emotions can deepen the connection between brands and consumers. It’s not only a pop-up thing: the self-proclaimed “most interesting store in the world,” Showfields, features experiential elements like physical slides, art installations, and playful demos for visitors to try the products of otherwise direct-to-consumer brands.</p>
      <p>While retail is far from dead and is simply evolving, PopSugar is capitalizing on the fact that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlesrtaylor/2019/11/14/holiday-shopping-patterns-when-do-consumers-shop-online-vs-in-store/#2ff1b76c4b8a">60% of holiday sales are still made in-store</a> (in November, leading up to Black Friday) and that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlesrtaylor/2019/11/14/holiday-shopping-patterns-when-do-consumers-shop-online-vs-in-store/#2ff1b76c4b8a">the discovery of a product takes place in a store</a>, where a consumer can see and touch the products. </p>
      <p>PopSugar is meeting shoppers where they are this season by putting an immersive twist on the traditional holiday pop-up that offers a playful and modern approach with its Sugar Chalet, taking place at The Overlook at Winter Village at Bryant Park in New York City, on Saturday, November 23. And while its visually-driven setup will serve as Instagram eye candy, PopSugar is aiming to create connection between consumer and brand – more than simply inspiring social media content.</p>

      <p>I spoke with Lindsay Leaf, PopSugar's Vice President of Experiential Marketing, to hear her insight on the upcoming Sugar Chalet activation, what PopSugar has learned about this past summer’s PopSugar Play/Ground festival, and what this all further demonstrates about the future of retail.</p>
      <p><b>Karin Eldor:</b> Why did you feel it was important to add an experiential, playful element to the traditional pop-up for the upcoming holiday season? </p>
      <p><b>Lindsay Leaf:</b> Shoppers are no longer just buying a lipgloss, a sports bra or a pair of boots, but, instead, are buying <i>into</i> a brand and a lifestyle. We wanted to create a fantasy world where consumers could immerse themselves in an après ski setting while spending time shopping and discovering new brands, connecting with friends, and treating themselves.  That’s what we've built with the Sugar Chalet.</p>
      <p>We took a consumer-first approach to further build it out with a curation of interactive, shoppable experiences like "fireside" yoga, meditation sessions, makeovers, curated culinary kiosks, pop-up shops, and more from brands like Athleta, E.L.F. Cosmetics, and Nature's Way. </p>
      <p><b>Eldor:</b> How did you select the activities that are available?</p>
      <p><b>Leaf: </b>Every moment of the Sugar Chalet experience was designed to support PopSugar’s overarching goal of fostering joy, engagement and discovery within a playful lens. Our key partners, like us, represent health, wellness, style, and beauty, and the on-site activities align with the winter-meets-wellness needs of our consumers during this time of the year.</p>
      <p><b>Eldor:</b> Is the purpose of Sugar Chalet to foster connection with others, or connection with brands? Or both?</p>
      <p><b>Leaf: </b>Both. We feel confident this one-of-a-kind pop-up will create meaningful connections between attendees and our brand partners through offline, immersive experiences that foster education, engagement and entertainment at every layer.</p>
      <p><b>Eldor: </b>Why do you think connection has become a goal for many brands and media outlets?</p>
      <p><b>Leaf: </b>It’s important now more than ever to engage our audience where they are – both online and offline. The digital media landscape is shifting as millennial and Gen Z consumers crave offline interactions and connection through community. In today’s world, consumers can digest and discover brands via digital mediums by scrolling, posting, following, and sharing to their heart’s content, but nothing will ever compare to actual experiences and deeper memorable IRL interactions.  </p>
      <p><b>Eldor:</b> Many activations and pop-ups are saying they want to go beyond Insta-worthy moments, but at the end of the day, a measurable goal to brand partners is number of shares and hashtags, so I always challenge this! How will you measure connection, which is such a qualitative overarching goal? </p>
      <p><b>Leaf: </b>Our primary criteria for measuring the success of Sugar Chalet will be foot traffic and programming attendance, on-site purchases, and feedback garnered through post-event surveys. PopSugar is a digitally-native brand and social amplification will, of course, layer into our overarching metrics for success, but we count this as a secondary KPI.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, we are architecting consumer-first experiential activations that will build and evolve over time. To do that successfully, we have to create something much deeper than an Instagram moment. We know when we really connect with consumers that social amplification will come, but we need to prioritize that connection over a simple Instagram post. </p>
      <p><b>Eldor: </b>I love the buzz you've created with the PopSugar Play/Ground, which took place for a second year this past summer. What are some of the most important key takeaways you've learned from there, which speak to the future of retail and to what the female millennial customer is craving? </p>
      <p><b>Leaf:</b> Millennials and members of Gen Z are craving joy, discovery and information. They are multi-faceted and the PopSugar Play/Ground speaks to that. We don't put parameters around it and say, <i>this is for fitness enthusiasts</i>, or <i>this is for wellness buffs</i> -- Play/Ground is for everyone. We added a lot of programming to our lineup this year which really resonated.</p>
      <p>This consumer wants to hear from the people behind the brands, they want to understand how products play into their lives, they seek real information and interaction. We brought a stage into our pop-up shop this year and hosted conversations with industry icons like Jenna Lyons, Stacey Bendet, Cynthia Rowley, and more. In general, the female millennial customer is craving inclusion - they want a seat at the table. They want to go beyond the racks and product displays and understand what's behind the brand, and the best way to deliver that opportunity is through experiences.</p>
