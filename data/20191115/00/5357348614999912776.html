        <b>A man of “unquestioned integrity, incredible decency, an innovator and patriot”, is how Gordon “Butch” Stewart described his long-time friend Douglas Vaz, who died in his sleep last Saturday, November 9, aged 83.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stewart, the chairman of the Sandals and ATL group of companies including this newspaper, said in a tribute yesterday to the former industry minister that he would greatly miss Vaz and the warm and close friendship they enjoyed over many years.</p>
      <p>“I have been fortunate to see upfront Douglas Vaz's deep devotion to his country, his loyalty to family and friends, and his struggles to improve the lives of all Jamaicans without any consideration for party affiliation. He was just a great human being,” Stewart said.</p>
      <p>“Much of his service to Jamaica came in the business sector where he developed a reputation as a fighter on behalf of manufacturers, going on to serve the then Jamaica Manufacturers' Association (JMA) with great distinction.</p>
      <p>“But believing that was not enough, he entered representational politics, a powerful vantage point from where he could serve the broader interest of all Jamaicans. To his final days he maintained a keen interest in the well-being of Jamaica, and has never lost sight of the notion that the purpose of politics was to give the highest quality of public service,” said Stewart.</p>
      <p>“Among the things Dougie Vaz valued most was a good name. He was a man of unquestioned integrity, incredible decency, an innovator and a patriot to the last. I'll also miss his wit and affability on our many travels together, especially across the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>“I wish to express my sincere condolence to Dougie's family, friends and associates on the loss of a beloved son of Jamaica,” said Stewart.</p>
