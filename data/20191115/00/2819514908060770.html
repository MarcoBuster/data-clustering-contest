      <p>The ancient bird lived approximately 120 million years ago during the Aptian age of the Early Cretaceous epoch.</p>
      <p>Dubbed <i>Fukuipteryx prima</i>, it was the size of a pigeon and is one of the most primitive birds ever discovered.</p>
      <p>“<i>Fukuipteryx prima</i> is a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=b5_DyhNk7FcC&amp;pg=PA30">non-ornithothoracine bird</a> and is the first such record to our knowledge outside north-eastern China,” said <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Takuya_Imai">Dr. Takuya Imai</a>, a researcher in the Institute of Dinosaur Research at the Fukui Prefectural University and the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, and his colleagues from Japan and China.</p>
      <p>Except for <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, non-ornithothoracine birds had previously been known only from the Jehol Biota and contemporary deposits in northern Korean Peninsula.</p>
      <p>The partial skeleton of <i>Fukuipteryx prima</i> was found in the Kitadani Dinosaur Quarry in the city of Katsuyama in Japan’s Fukui province in 2013.</p>
      <p>“Unlike most other Early Cretaceous birds, the specimen is 3D preserved, and exhibits several autapomorphies, leading to erect a new taxon, <i>Fukuipteryx prima</i>,” the paleontologists said.</p>

      <p>A bone analysis suggests that this individual was likely a subadult (less than one year old) nearly reaching its skeletal maturity.</p>
      <p>The bird had a set of features comparable to that of other earliest birds including <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.</p>
      <p>However, it was much more advanced than <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and had a long, robust, and rod-shaped pygostyle — a fused cluster of tail vertebrae to which to which tail feathers are attached.</p>
      <p>Dr. Imai and co-authors believe that <i>Fukuipteryx prima</i> was capable of limited flight.</p>
      <p>“The discovery of <i>Fukuipteryx prima</i> further increases the geological distribution of non-ornithothoracine birds,” they said.</p>
      <p>“It appears that they are not restricted to a relatively cold, highland lacustrine environment in the Early Cretaceous of north-eastern China, but inhabited more temperate, lowland regions such as the one represented by the Kitadani Formation, most likely with other ornithothoracines widespread around the globe.”</p>
