        <b>Vice-chairman of Riga City Council and shareholder Vadims Baraņņiks has dismissed the board of SIA Riga Central Market.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He explained this decision by saying that Friday, 15 November, is scheduled to hold a meeting of the management to discuss this year’s budget amendments, which were commented on by Riga City Council’s Property Department’s Commercial Operations Office in a negative light.</p>
      <p>«The office does not like the board’s approach towards process of drawing up amendments. They also dislike the company is losing payers, because of which there may be losses for a second consecutive years. I received no clear indications how the board plans to resolve this situation,» claims Baraņņiks.</p>
      <p>According to him, he offered to board members to assess their responsibility for their posts and submit resignations. However, in response to criticisms, board members left the meeting. As a result of this, the vice-mayor decided to dismiss the board.</p>
      <p>Until now Artis Druvinieks was Riga Central Market’s board chairman. Board members included Kaspars Zauls and Valdis Karnītis.</p>
