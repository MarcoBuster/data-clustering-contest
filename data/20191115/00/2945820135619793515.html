      <p>Eric Granado (Avintia Esponsorama Racing) set the fastest FIM Enel MotoE™ World Cup lap of the weekend to claim E-Pole at the Gran Premio Motul de la Comunitat Valenciana. Cup standings leader Matteo Ferrari (Trentino Gresini MotoE) and Free Practice pacesetter Bradley Smith (One Energy Racing) will join the Brazilian on the front row for Races 1 and 2.</p>

      <p>After the first eight riders had given their all over one flying lap of the Circuit Ricardo Tormo, it was Jesko Raffin (Dynavolt Intact GP) led the way with a 1:41.218, 0.8 clear of Sete Gibernau (Join Contract Pons 40). Xavier Simeon (Avintia Esponsorama Racing) then went close to as the gap to Raffin was cut to 0.192, with Hector Garzo (Tech 3 E-Racing) then finding time in the last split to place himself into provisional P2. Then came Granado - and it was a stunner. After three splits the Avintia rider was 0.4 up on Raffin’s time and by the line, 0.666 was the margin. A devilish lap from Granado – the best of the weekend – then piled the pressure on the remaining two riders: Cup leader Ferrari and title contender Smith.</p>
      <p>Ferrari was up first having finished P2 in Free Practice. Could the double winner from Misano stick his Energica Ego Corso on E-Pole? The answer was no but his lap was good enough to slot into P2, 0.3 off Granado’s P1 lap. Smith’s turn. Could the British rider claim his maiden E-Pole of the season? The number 38 was down by 0.2 in the first split which gave Smith a mountain to climb around the rest of the lap. In the end, Smith was able to go 0.085 quicker than Raffin to slot himself onto the front row – how pivotal could that prove to be come Saturday and Sunday?</p>
      <p>Granado, Ferrari, Smith – two of the top three in the title chase sit on the front row, second-place Garzo will launch from P5. The maiden MotoE™ title will be decided this weekend and Race 1 will commence at 16:15 local time (GMT+1) on Saturday. Tune in LIVE!</p>
