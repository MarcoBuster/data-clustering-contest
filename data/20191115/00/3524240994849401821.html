      <p> A lawyer from the Kabba/Bunu Local Government Area of Kogi State, Femi Joseph, has asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to disqualify the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate in Kogi State, Musa Wada, from participating in the Saturday governorship election.</p>
      <p> The plaintiff, who filed the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1147/2019, alleged that Wada submitted false information about his primary school certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission as the PDP’s candidate for the poll.</p>
      <p>He added that the “approximate date of birth for all authentic certificates issued in 1973 and about the time, only had year of birth and not the date and moth as the 3rd defendant’s (Wada’s) purported certificate of primary education”.</p>
      <p> He also said, among others, that Wada’s signature in 1975 as contained in the “purported certificate “is the same as that of today as evidenced by his signature on the Form CF001”.</p>
      <p> Listed as defendants in the suit are the PDP, INEC and Wada.</p>
