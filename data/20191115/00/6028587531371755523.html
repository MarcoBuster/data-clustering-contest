      <p>Last week, somewhere around a thousand education leaders, innovators, investors and experts from around the world were in Helsinki for two major conclaves – the annual conference of <a href="https://hundred.org/en">HundrED</a> and <a href="https://www.helsinkieducationweek.com/">Helsinki Education Week</a>.If you’re not familiar with HundrED, they are an unusual outfit. In an education ecosystem where profit and credit can overshadow impact, they don’t make or sell a product. They don’t have a specific agenda focus like early childhood or STEM or career training. Instead, they work on just about everything in education and give stuff away. They pretty much beg you to steal it.</p>
      <p>They scour the world for new education ideas, approaches, tactics and tools. They look for education innovations that are not only working but scalable. When they find them, HundrED pushes them into a global spotlight where others can see them and take them home. They want the ideas and practices and strategies that are working in one corner of the globe to spread and sprout anywhere they can be useful. The viral role they are trying to play in the global teaching and learning conversation is unquestionably needed.</p>
      <p>The centerpiece of that find and share effort is a collection of 100 education innovations they release annually. <a href="https://hundred.org/en/collections/hundred-2020">The 2020 list</a> was released at the Helsinki conference.</p>
      <p>If you are at all interested in what’s happening around the world in education, how people from Honduras to Hong Kong and from Haiti to Herzegovina are reshaping education, the 2020 collection of innovators is worth a scan. It’s not an unreasonable bet that some of those innovations and practices will find their way into European and American schools at some point. Maybe even soon.</p>
      <p>There are a literally a hundred of them, so it’s impossible to dig into them all or focus on any of them substantially. But here are a few that caught my eye.</p>
      <p>Scanning these, you may think the innovations selected by HundrED are Euro-centric. That’s not the case. In fact, many come from Asia, Africa and Central and South America and, by sheer impact, it’s those innovations that hold the most promise for lifting the quality of teaching and learning globally.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, here are a few that could improve schools in America and elsewhere.</p>
      <p><b>Tagtiv8 Active Learning (United Kingdom)</b> – While we discuss health and wellness and academic achievement, we rarely conceptualize them together. Already in use by an estimated 65,000 students across seven countries, Tagtiv8’s uses innovative physically active learning (PAL) approaches to address health and obesity while also meeting learning standards in language and math.</p>
      <p><b>leerKRACHT (Netherlands)</b> – Professional development is always a hot topic. In the Netherlands, leerKRACHT has an innovative, impact-proven approach to teacher professional development “to promote a continuous improvement culture” among teachers. The process is peer-based instead of driven by policy and has reached more than 300,000 since its deployment in 2012.</p>
      <p><b>Moscow Electronic School (Russia)</b> – While the U.S. discusses the value of open education resources (OER), the Moscow Electronic School has an electronic library with textbooks and electronic lessons in any subject freely available to anyone. Not only is access open, any teacher can make a book or a lesson and add it to the collection. Importantly, a panel of experts review the lessons and resources for accuracy and value. The school’s resources have reached an estimated 1.5 million students.</p>
      <p><b>Inspire X by Small Economy Works (Canada) – </b>Entrepreneurship can teach important so-called soft skills such as resilience, opportunity recognition and comfort with risk. This innovation produces a bespoke and culturally specific course curriculum and platform that allows students to learn essential technical skills related to entrepreneurship. The personal approach of their program helps students understand and leverage the power of entrepreneurial problem solving in ways that relate to the students and their community.</p>
      <p><b>Otsimo (Turkey)</b> – This innovator says that, in the U.S. alone, “one in 68 children as diagnosed on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD).” Otsimo uses game-based learning apps to spread access to special education and speech therapy that are crucial for future and continued development.  </p>
      <p>Of course, the best solutions or ideas in the world won’t do much good if today’s teachers and policy makers and parents aren’t open to them. That’s a challenge of different variety – a challenge we can’t even begin to address if those same leaders don’t even know there are options, opportunities being piloted and perfected around the world.</p>
      <p>It seems silly that education, the very art and science of sharing information, needs an organization like HundrED to help share information about education itself. But it does. And we do, because we cannot be the best possible teachers if we’re not always willing to learn.</p>
