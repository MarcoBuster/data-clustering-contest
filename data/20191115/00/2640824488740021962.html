      <h1>think architecture arranges house in a park as series of indepentant volumes in zurich</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">sofia lekka angelopoulou</a></address>
      <p><b>swiss firm think architecture has built <i>house in a park</i> in <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/architecture-in-switzerland/">zurich</a> as a series of single-story, freely arranged spaces, held together by a continuous roof.</b> shaped according to the natural contours of the area, the independent <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/residential-architecture-interiors/"><b>residential</b></a> volumes blend harmoniously into the surrounding environment of this park-like plot. the actual size of the house is disguised thanks to its basic meandering shape, and its projections and recesses allow it to merge with the landscape of the surrounding parkland.</p>

      <p>all images by <a href="http://www.simonebossi.it/">simone bossi<br/></a><b><a href="https://www.thinkarchitecture.ch/">think architecture</a> has arranged the series of single-story spaces freely on the hilltop site, connecting them together through a continuous roof.</b> the volumes are clad with natural stone, while a continuous, exposed concrete facing around the edge of the roof ties them all together. all units are internally connected, and have direct access to the garden, while they also benefit from views of the park toward the mountain or toward the lake zurich basin, depending on their orientation.</p>

      <p><b>floor-to-ceiling wood and metal windows and occasional skylights throughout the house bring plenty of natural light within the interior, and emphasize the relation to the exterior landscape.</b> on top of living spaces, bedrooms, a home office, and a music room, the private residence contains an indoor pool, as well as other leisure spaces, which are located below ground level.</p>
