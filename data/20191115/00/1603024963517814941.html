      <p>The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 5.2 percent QoQ (up 41 percent YoY) to Rs 8,936.3 crore in quarter ended in September. The margin expanded to 42.3 percent during the quarter, up 130bps sequentially and 1,080bps YoY.</p>
      <p>Bharti Airtel expressed doubt about its ability to carry on operations in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's judgement on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR).</p>
      <p>"The Group will require significant additional financing to discharge its obligations under the Court Judgement; the management's actions include, inter alia, accessing diversified sources of finance," it stated in a release.</p>
      <p>"The Group has an established track record of accessing diversified sources of finance across markets and currencies. However, there can be no assurance of the success of management's plans to access additional sources of finance to the extent required, on terms acceptable to Group, and to raise these amounts in a timely manner. This represents a material uncertainty whereby, it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, and accordingly may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern," the company added.</p>
      <p>However, global research firms have a mixed view on the stock price after its dismal Q2 numbers.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
