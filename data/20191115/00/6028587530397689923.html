      <p>Protecting her swaddled baby in one arm, a fashionable woman with a pageboy haircut and high heels bravely wards off a uniformed soldier, grabbing his sword-wielding arm with her other hand. Next to her stands a working man clad in overalls and a cap, his right fist clenched in anticipation of punching the armed soldier. The empowered couple represents class struggle that transcends their own cultural positions. Diego Rivera’s <i>The Uprising</i> (1931), a massive fresco on reinforced cement in a galvanized-steel framework, is both timely and timeless. While Rivera’s work was deeply rooted in depicting the strife of the radical nationalist Mexican Revolution as well as the first worker’s state in Russia in 1917, there is a universal message that resonated with American artists working at the time and during every subsequent global social upheaval.</p>
      <p>Featuring some 200 paintings, portable frescoes, films, sculptures, prints, photographs and drawings, as well as reproductions of in-situ murals, by 60 American and Mexican artists,<i> Vida Americana: Mexican Muralists Remake American Art, 1925–1945 </i>at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York,<i> </i>takes a deep dive into the fervent influence of Mexican artists on their American counterparts between 1925 and 1945.</p>
      <p>“It’s an important show because it essentially rewrites art history,” <i>Vida Americana</i> curator Barbara Haskell said in an interview. “There is this assumption by Americans that everything came form Europe. This exhibition really turns this idea on its head. … The work is so powerful, it’s so forceful, on every level, and I think what’s so exciting to American artists is that [Mexican muralists] created works that were so modern, combining techniques from Europe with subject matter that was so relevant and unique to the moment. These are artists that really believe art had a social role. Art had a responsibility to shine light on justice and injustice.”</p>
      <p>By presenting art of Mexican muralists alongside work of their American contemporaries, <i>Vida Americana</i> subverts art history, demonstrating the sea change ushered in by Mexican art, especially in the work of American artists who sought to surpass European modernism and the School of Paris.</p>
      <p>As American artists and art lovers wrestled with the economic injustices made evident by the Great Depression, Mexican artists introduced an innovative method of exposing social and political subject matter that was relevant to everyday life and transformed the interaction between art and the people.</p>
      <p>Besides the three best-known Mexican muralists (Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros), the landmark exhibition includes Mexican artists such as Miguel Covarrubias, María Izquierdo, Frida Kahlo, Mardonio Magaña, Alfredo Ramos Martínez and Rufino Tamayo. Their work will be shown alongside prominent and under-recognized American artists including Thomas Hart Benton, Elizabeth Catlett, Aaron Douglas, Marion Greenwood, William Gropper, Philip Guston, Eitarō Ishigaki, Jacob Lawrence, Harold Lehman, Fletcher Martin, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Ben Shahn, Thelma Johnson Streat, Charles White and Hale Woodruff.</p>
      <p>Opening February 17, 2020, and on view through May 17, 2020, <i>Vida Americana </i>will be installed as nine thematic sections taking over the Whitney’s fifth-floor Neil Bluhm Family Galleries.</p>
      <p>“Each gallery has divided the show into chapters taking on different issues with pivotal works that define those themes,” said Haskell. “The first gallery is Romantic Nationalism and the Mexican Revolution. Rivera is obviously one of the key figures in the U.S. One of his <i>Flower Festival</i> pieces and another work of the Revolution are both pivotal pieces in the gallery.”</p>
      <p>Works by lesser-known artists like Martínez, a painter, muralist and educator, who lived and worked in Mexico, Paris and Los Angeles, and was regarded as the Father of Mexican Modernism, “will be a surprise to people,” said Haskell.</p>

      <p>An avid follower of Mexican muralists who were working in the United States, a young Pollock was influenced by Rivera and became a member of the Siqueiros Experimental Workshop, working with other students to create large public artworks to combat fascism.</p>

      <p>“Relationships between (Mexican and American) artists will be very apparent. We’re juxtaposing paintings by Mexican artists with their American counterparts. In that way, people will be amazed at how strong the influence is between the work of Siqueiros and Pollock. It is so apparent you don’t need a wall plaque to explain how influenced Pollock was.”</p>
      <p>In 1934, Guston (known at the time as Philip Goldstein), traveled with artist Reuben Kadish and poet Jules Langsner to Mexico, where they produced <i>The Struggle Against Terror</i>, an antifascist mural clearly influenced by Siqueiros, on a 1,000-square-foot wall in the former summer palace of the Emperor Maximilian in the state capital of Morelia. “The baroque, undulating surfaces (inspired by Siqueiros’ work) are totally apparent in Guston,” said Haskell.</p>

      <p>Though he never traveled to Mexico, “Jacob Lawrence looked to Orozco for a sense of a national narrative toward revolution,” said Haskell. “He did talk about Orozco being his main inspiration in how he created shades and formatting.”</p>
      <p>The Whitney traces its own relationship with Mexican muralists to 1924, when founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney exhibited the work of Orozco, Luis Hidalgo and Covarrubias at the Whitney Studio Club, organized by artist Alexander Brook, a leader among New York City’s mainstream figurative painters during the 1930s. Juliana Force, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney’s executive assistant and a future director of the museum, helped to boost Orozco’s presence in the United States by acquiring ten of his drawings.</p>
      <p>Over time, the Mexican muralists cemented a major impact on the artists promoted by the Studio Club, and eventually the Whitney Museum, including Americans Benton, Gropper, Noguchi and Shahn, who are part of <i>Vida Americana</i>.</p>
      <p>“I think the strength of this work is so powerful that people will come in and really be engaged in how the art can communicate messages that really resonate and are still important,” said Haskell, who was assisted by Sarah Humphreville, senior curatorial assistant, and Alana Hernandez, former curatorial project assistant. “The idea that art can be vanguard and can tell a story and relate to everyday, average people is also a very powerful subtext of this exhibition.”</p>
      <p>The exhibition will travel to the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, where it will be on display from June 25, 2020, through October 4, 2020.</p>
