      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A group of conservative lawmakers in Ohio has introduced a bill to outlaw abortion outright.</p>
      <p>State Rep. Candice Keller is a Republican from Middletown and says backers are tired of taking an incremental approach to ending abortion.</p>
      <p>The legislation was introduced Thursday. It declares a fetus a person and would subject doctors who terminate pregnancies to potential murder charges.</p>
