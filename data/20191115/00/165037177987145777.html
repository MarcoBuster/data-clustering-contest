        <b>Argentina play Brazil in Riyadh on Friday and Lionel Messi returns to their starting XI following a four-match ban.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://es.besoccer.com/jugador/l-messi-23569">Lionel Messi</a> <b>was restored to Argentina's starting XI to face Brazil </b>upon his return from a three-month suspension. Messi has not played for Argentina since being sent off in the Copa America third-place play-off against Chile in July<b>. It was the Barcelona superstar's post-match outburst</b> after the semi-final defeat to Brazil that resulted in his suspension, however, as he accused CONMEBOL of corruption and favouring Tite's Copa America hosts.</p>
      <p><b>That earned him a lengthy ban and a $50,000 fine</b>, with Messi missing games against Chile, Mexico, Germany and Ecuador. But having been included in the squad once again, Messi was straight back into the starting XI for the contest in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Joining him in attack was Lautaro Martinez – passed fit after sustaining a head injury with Inter at the weekend – while Sergio Aguero,<b> who like Messi has not featured for Argentina</b> since the Copa America, was on the bench.</p>
