      <p>Sleep is traditionally considered to be a homeostatic process that resists deviation from equilibrium.</p>
      <p>In that regard, brief episodes of waking are viewed as perturbations that lead to sleep fragmentation and related sleep disorders.</p>
      <p>While addressing aspects of sleep regulation related to consolidated sleep and wake and the sleep-wake cycle, the homeostatic paradigm does not account for the dozens of abrupt sleep-stage transitions and micro-states within sleep stages throughout the night.</p>
      <p>A research team led by Boston University scientists Dr. Xiyun Zhang amd Professor Plamen Ivanov hypothesized that, while sleep is indeed homeostatic at time scales of hours and days, non-equilibrium dynamics and criticality underlie sleep micro-architecture at shorter time scales.</p>
      <p>To test this hypothesis, the scientists collected electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain activity over multiple days in normal rats and in rats with injuries to the parafacial zone, a brain region that helps regulate sleep.</p>
      <p>They analyzed the bursting dynamics of brain activity patterns known as theta waves and delta waves, which are seen in both sleeping rats and humans.</p>
      <p>Their findings and modeling indicate that arousals from sleep are a manifestation of an intrinsic non-equilibrium sleep regulatory mechanism related to self-organization of neuronal assemblies.</p>
      <p>This mechanism acts at time scales of seconds and minutes and stays on track via continuous bursts in brain wave rhythms.</p>
      <p>The study also suggests that maintaining a non-equilibrium critical state is essential for the sleep-regulation system’s flexibility to spontaneously activate multiple transitions between different sleep stages and between sleep and brief wakefulness throughout the sleep period.</p>
      <p>Such critical state is also necessary for the complex sleep micro-architecture that is increasingly recognized to be characteristic of healthy sleep.</p>
      <p>The observed critical behavior in sleep draws parallels to other non-equilibrium systems at criticality, such as earthquakes.</p>
      <p>“Paradoxically, we find that the ‘resting’ state of healthy sleep is maintained through bursts in cortical rhythm activity that obey similar temporal organization, statistics, and mathematical laws as earthquakes,” Professor Ivanov said.</p>
      <p>“Our findings serve as building blocks to better understand sleep, and could help improve detection and treatment of sleep disorders.”</p>
