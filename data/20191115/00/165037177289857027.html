        <b>The Euro's are just around the corner and we already know the name of other teams who will be present in the competition. After imposing a 3-0 win over Liechtenstein, Finland have become the eleventh team to qualify for the tournament.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Finnish national team made history this Friday</b>: their first qualification for Euro 2020 and, going even further, their first major football tournament. They did so with <b>a foreseeable victory over Liechtenstein</b>, whom they beat 3-0 in Helsinki with a double from their indispensable scorer: Teemu Pukki.</p>
      <p>The eigth and ninth goal in nine games for this Norwich footballer, who, in the past played ar Sevilla, with some time in the first team, and helped his team by giving them the <b>2-0 lead from the penalty spot</b> in the 64th minute, and <b>sealed the win with the third goal </b>to make it 3-0 in the 75th minute.</p>
      <p>The win had begun, perhaps even defined already - <b>Liechtenstein only had one shot on target out of three in the entire match</b>, they are in <b>second place in Group F, behind Finland</b>, who are competing for the first time amongst some of the best teams on the continent.</p>
      <p><b>Finland are the latest to qualify.</b> On Thursday, <b>Turkey, France, England and the Czech Republic</b> also did so.<b> Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Russia and Ukraine</b> already achieved their pass to the Euro 2020.</p>
