        <b>Head coach of the Black Stars Kwesi Appiah has hailed the influence of his deputy CK Akonnor in team's win over South Africa on Thursday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Akonnor, 45, replaced Ibrahim Tanko as deputy trainer late last month for the four-time Africa champions ahead of the two qualifying matches.</p>
      <p>The former Hearts of Oak and Asante Kotoko gaffer was on the bench when the Black Stars brought smiles to the faces of Ghanaians following their 2-0 win over South Africa in the first match of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against South Africa at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium.</p>
      <p>Goals from either half by Thomas Partey and substitute Kudus Mohammed were enough for the four-time Africa champions to see off the Bafana Bafana.</p>
