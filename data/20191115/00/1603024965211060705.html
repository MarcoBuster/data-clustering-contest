      <p>Telecom operator <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/telecommunications-service/tatateleservicesmaharashtra/TTM01">Tata Teleservices</a> (Maharashtra) on November 15 posted a loss of Rs 2,335 crore on account of provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues. The company had recorded a loss of Rs 383.06 crore in the same period a year ago.</p>
      <p>Tata Teleservices ( Maharashtra) Limited (TTML) made a provision of Rs 2,151 crore following the Supreme Court order on calculation of annual adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of telecom companies.</p>
      <p>The apex court last month upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses in calculating the annual AGR, a share of which has to be paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.</p>

      <p>The revenue of TTML declined by about 16 percent to Rs 270.35 crore during the reported quarter from Rs 321.84 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Though the company has demerged its consumer mobile business, the Department of Telecom has not taken the same on record.</p>
      <p>"The Company understands that DoT has filed Special leave Petitions against BAL (Bharti Airtel) in Hon'ble Supreme Court challenging interim orders of TDSAT," TTML said in a note.</p>
      <p>Shares of TTML closed at Rs 2.71 a unit, down by 3.56 percent compared to previous close, at the BSE on Friday.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
