      <p>Good news in City Hall: With a little help from friends in Albany, Buffalo closed out its 2018-19 fiscal year with a $948,715 surplus.</p>
      <p>The glad tidings come on the wings of a $7.5 million advance from the state on the $17 million owed by the Seneca Nation of Indians. The Senecas, in the end stages of a two-year dispute, have withheld casino revenues it owes the state, some of which get passed on to the localities in which those casinos operate.</p>
      <p>The Senecas’ intransigence should end with a federal judge’s ruling last week.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Court Judge William M. Skretny agreed with an arbitration panel which ruled that the Senecas wrongly withheld at least $255 million in casino revenue payments to New York State. The tribe now needs to make good and pay what it owes the state from the hundreds of millions of dollars it vacuums up at its three Western New York casinos.</p>
      <p>The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of city finances, and the independent author’s report, showed Buffalo’s reserves at $92.9 million as of June 30, an increase of $900,000 from the previous year.</p>
      <p>Buffalo is still owed another $9.5 million in casino money and the city has budgeted another $11 million in gambling revenue in its current $508.6 million spending plan for 2019-20. Officials have said from the beginning that they were confident that the money would be coming. The city also has benefited from a number of other factors that drove up revenues, including rising property values, a higher number of building permits and income from new parking places.</p>
      <p>On the expense side of the ledger, the city did well by shifting to self-insurance on prescription drugs, and is lowering its pension costs as new employees come on board, requiring smaller contributions by the city.</p>
      <p>On revenues, sales tax income ran higher than projected. Going forward this year, the focus is on making sure revenue is coming in as anticipated and there is also good news there: The first quarter of the fiscal year produced a surplus.</p>
      <p>Challenges lie ahead. Council Majority Leader David A. Rivera has noted Mayor Byron W. Brown’s preference to cut into fund balances rather than raise taxes (which he did two years ago). It’s a fair argument, but now the fund balance is low and, within that, the savings account is bare. They need to be rebuilt.</p>
      <p>And in September, Fitch Ratings, one of three major Wall Street rating agencies, lowered the city’s rating from AA- to A+, specifically cautioning that the use of reserves to balance the budget has “diminished the city’s fiscal resources” as well as its ability to respond to “cyclical economic stress.” The Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority, or control board and the two other credit rating agencies cited similar concerns.</p>
      <p>It is not unreasonable to expect incremental tax increases, although historically Mayor Byron W. Brown has indicated that he prefers to promote economic growth as part of an overall strategy. Evidence of those results can be seen in the city’s real estate market, where houses are selling fast and at close to their asking price.</p>
      <p>The city has budgeted another $11 million in casino funds this year and officials say anything beyond that will be used to replenish its savings account. That’s a start, but a more aggressive plan would be better.</p>
      <p>What is more, it is important to note, the Senecas have not committed to meeting their obligation, despite the court ruling. Without that money, the city will need another advance from the state or face grim alternatives.</p>
      <p>The Seneca Nation must agree that Buffalo and other municipalities have been good neighbors: It should send the money those communities are owed.</p>
