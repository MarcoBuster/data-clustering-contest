      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:17:51+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>The IDF Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) announced late Thursday that the Erez and Kerem Shalom border crossings with Gaza were reopened for the passage of people, produce, and products.</p>
      <p>The moves comes following a 48-hour closure due to the rocket fire from Gaza.</p>
      <p>In addition, the restriction has been lifted from the Gaza fishing zone, which has now expanded back to 15 nautical kilometers, the IDF Spokesperson said.</p>
