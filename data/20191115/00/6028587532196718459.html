      <p>The defining moment of 2019 so far is the incredible cross-asset rally that took place from the bottom of the Christmas Eve 2018 massacre all the way through the low of the 10-year Treasury yield in the first week of September. It included stocks — led by low-volatility bond proxies and high-valuation growth companies — Treasuries, gold, and of course, bitcoin, up 275% at one point.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin picked up steam earlier than gold, after a massive buyer rallied the price back above $4,000 in early April. This was almost precisely when stock market volatility as measured by the VIX finally receded back to mid-2018 levels below 13. Just like how bitcoin's epic 2017 rally preceded the frothiest, most expensive S&amp;P 500 market top we've seen in this recovery, bitcoin once again gained steam at the onset of a period of intense risk-on activity in markets.</p>
      <p>But then it started crashing in the summer, even as stocks and other risk-on assets continued their run. Why? Because the best way to consider bitcoin is as a highly speculative gamble on its future use as a store of value. For some, especially those who rode the bandwagon in 2017, bitcoin was little more than a roulette wheel. But for most others, it is best thought of as an incredibly far out-of-the-money call option on bitcoin's path to adoption, to borrow a phrase from my friends at Delphi Digital. Because of this, it has traded both as a speculative asset and a store of value.</p>
      <p>Viewed through the SOV lens, bitcoin’s 2019 run makes a ton of sense. It was a response to improvement in the underlying probability that the bullish bitcoin event-series would occur: negative-yielding assets were on the rise, the Fed reversed course, and trade wars were heading to currency wars. As this backdrop fell into place, bitcoin and gold traded closely in sync, with the 30-day correlation between bitcoin and gold futures reaching a record high of 0.91 in mid-July. It's not a coincidence.</p>
      <p>Close your eyes and listen to an interview with a gold bug. Then listen to one with a cryptoknight. You really can't tell the difference. Open your eyes, and if you see the person has a tie on, they're a gold bug. That's basically it.</p>
      <p>But here's the kicker: in 2019, swapping "gold" with "bonds" yields little difference in the justification for owning each asset, and the two have traded at a very tight correlation for much of the year. Bonds, gold, and bitcoin all rallied because they all offered a way to capitalize on central bank extravagance and increasingly low interest rates; they just appeal to three different types of investors. And with bitcoin offering the least likely path to success — but biggest reward if it is widely adopted — it became the highest beta version of the safe haven trades.</p>
      <p>When I bring this idea up to analysts or portfolio managers on my shows, they usually laugh it off. Traditional investors recoil at the notion that bitcoin has macroeconomic tie-ins, because the implication is that their precious Treasury market is probably in a bit of a bubble too. Characteristic of the current polarized environment, few seem capable of holding a nuanced view on the asset class.</p>
      <p>But for those who do, it is arguably the best leading indicator for where safe-haven trades go next. Right now, that means more downside in King Crypto suggests more downside for bonds and gold. And if it's a major plunge like last year, that's likely also to show up in risk assets like stocks.</p>
