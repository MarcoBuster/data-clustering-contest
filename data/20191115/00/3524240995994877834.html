      <p>The Lagos State Commissioner for Local Governments and Community Affairs, Yetunde Arobieke, has urged all the public officials in the 57 local governments and local council development areas in the state to think globally to facilitate the developmental agenda and blueprint of the state government.</p>
      <p>The commissioner gave the advice while speaking at an advocacy programme on procurement process organised by the Lagos State Public Procurement Agency for chairmen, council managers, council engineers, council treasurers and procurement officers in the 57 LGAs and LCDAs.</p>
      <p>Arobieke said the programme was designed to equip participants with the requisite knowledge and skills in procurement and contract management required for the implementation of projects and procurement of goods and services.</p>
      <p>She said, “The state government is aware of the fact that an efficient and effective public procurement process is a necessary condition for efficient and effective service delivery and good governance and the establishment of the procurement agency by the state government had assisted the government in facilitating the attainment of its developmental agenda which is built around economic, infrastructural, social development, security and sustainable environment.</p>
      <p>“So, I want all workers to rise above the traditional constraints and old ways of doing things and begin to think globally, but act locally to facilitate the achievement of the developmental agenda and blueprint of the state government in all sectors of the state’s economy.”</p>
      <p>The Head of Service in the state, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, who was represented by Toyin Machado-Onanuga, emphasised the need for those charged with the responsibility of implementing the procurement law to be more diligent and conversant with the emerging development in public procurement.</p>
