      <h1>Realme X2 Pro "blind order" sale starts in India on November 18</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=25" target="_blank">Vlad</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_x2_pro-9904.php">Realme X2 Pro</a> will be officially <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_x2_pro_india_launch_date-news-39651.php">introduced in India on November 20</a>, but since the phone has already been launched elsewhere, it's not really a mystery anymore. The only missing detail is the pricing for the subcontinent, basically.</p>
      <p>If you're already excited about the device and want to be among the first people in India to get one, you can participate in Realme's "blind order" sale. Here's what this entails.</p>

      <p>On November 18, you visit the official website, login, and follow the steps on the blind order page to pay INR 1,000 as a deposit. This ensures 100% that you will be able to purchase one of the units in the first batch, that is specifically set aside for this order process.</p>
      <p>The batch consists of just 855 devices, because Snapdragon 855 - get it? The X2 Pro is Realme's first phone to boast flagship specs. Anyway, then on November 20 to 21 you will have to pay the remaining balance due - the difference between the price of the version you picked and the INR 1,000 you already paid. As soon as you settle the balance, the phone will be shipped to you, so if you're fast and do that on November 20, it will be dispatched on the same day.</p>

      <p>This, presumably, means you'll have your X2 Pro in your hands before the first normal, general sale is even available for other people.</p>
      <p>The Realme X2 Pro boasts a 4,000 mAh battery that charges from 0 to 100% in just 35 minutes using SuperVOOC Flash Charge. The in-display fingerprint sensor unlocks the phone in just 0.23 seconds, while the device also has dual stereo speakers, a 64 MP primary rear camera, an 8 MP ultrawide, a 13 MP telephoto lens, and a 2 MP depth sensor. For selfies you get a 16 MP cam, and the software is Android 9 Pie with ColorOS on top.</p>
