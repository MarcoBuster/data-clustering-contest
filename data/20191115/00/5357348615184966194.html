        <b>A State witness in the trial against Tesha Miller yesterday explained how he knew that the killing of then Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC) chairman Douglas Chambers was a hit, and who had killed him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The witness, who is being referred to as Witness One by the <b>Jamaica Observer</b> because the court instructed that all witnesses remain anonymous, testified during his evidence-in-chief that Miller told him face-to-face that Douglas's killing was a contract.</p>
      <p>During the trial's morning session, Witness One testified that he was standing at a stall across from the JUTC depot in Spanish Town, St Catherine when he allegedly saw “Blackman and Bruckie” exit a motor vehicle and fired at Chambers.</p>
      <p>Although he said both men carried out the execution, he admitted that he was unable to see Blackman's face because he was wearing a black pullover.</p>
      <p>However, the witness said he knew it was him because he had handed over two guns to Blackman and Bruckie prior to the killing.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the witness testified that he was instructed to create a diversion group a day before the JUTC chairman was murdered.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, he confessed that he was a member of the diversion group and that after he handed over the guns to “Blackman”, he went for his gun and placed it on his waist before meeting up with other members.</p>
      <p>He further confessed that after Chambers was shot, he “started to fire whole heap a shot in the air, so di shot dat we fire in di air [was] to scare the people that were coming out so dat di man dem could escape”.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor asked him for how long was he firing the shots.</p>
      <p>“Not for very long,” he replied.</p>
      <p>Chambers was shot dead at the JUTC depot in Spanish Town on June 27, 2008, after he had left a meeting to smoke a cigarette outside.</p>
      <p>According to police reports, two men armed with a high-powered rifle and a .45 calibre handgun shot Chambers repeatedly in the head.</p>
      <p>During the afternoon session of the trial, the witness told the court that when he asked Miller about Blackman's whereabouts the following day, because he had not seen him since the incident, Miller told him that he had sent him on a boat to the Cayman Islands.</p>
      <p>Miller is charged with accessory to murder before and after the fact.</p>
      <p>The trial, which began in the Home Circuit Court on Wednesday, is scheduled to continue today.</p>
