        <b>The Mercedes Formula E team has announced that ex-Formula 1 racer Esteban Gutierrez will share its reserve and development driver requirements with Gary Paffett during the 2019-20 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gutierrez, who competed in three FE races for the Techeetah team during the 2016-17 season, tested Mercedes' Silver Arrow 01 package at in Majorca in August before it announced Stoffel Vandoorne and Nyck de Vries as its driver line-up for its debut season in the electric championship.</p>
      <p>Paffett's role as a Mercedes reserve and development driver <a href="https://www.autosport.com/fe/news/146589/paffett-gets-dual-role-with-mercedes-in-formula-e">was announced ahead</a> of the start of last month's group test at Valencia but the team has now given Gutierrez a concurrent job alongside the double DTM champion.</p>
      <p>A Mercedes spokesperson confirmed to Autosport that the pair will alternate in attending FE events, with Gutierrez, who has worked as a Mercedes F1 simulator driver since 2018, the one travelling to next week's FE season-opening race in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>"I'm very much looking forward to continuing my journey with the Mercedes family by joining Formula E as a reserve and development driver," said Gutierrez.</p>

      <p>"I would like to thank the team for giving me the chance to join them as they embark on this new and exciting chapter."</p>
      <p>Mercedes team principal Ian James, said: "We will face a lot of challenges in our first season in Formula E, so I'm really pleased we've been able to acquire the services of Esteban, another experienced driver.</p>
      <p>"He did an excellent job during testing in Majorca, fitting in perfectly with the team.</p>
      <p>"He has a lot of experience to offer from racing in a number of different series - Formula 1, Formula E and IndyCar - and has also gained a lot of know-how in the simulator about how to develop and setup a car.</p>
      <p>"We are certain that he will be of enormous help with the tasks we face in our debut season in his joint role as reserve and development driver with Gary."</p>
      <p>Paffett's role <a href="https://www.autosport.com/fe/news/147019/mercedes-explains-paffett-management-role">also includes</a> a management aspect, which the team hopes will provide a "check and balance" on feedback between its race drivers and engineers.</p>
