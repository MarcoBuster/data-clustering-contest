      <h1>Paul George: ‘I Thought I Was Terrible’ in Season Debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/paul-george">Paul George</a> thought he was “terrible” in his season debut Thursday night, as he scored 33 points in 24 minutes of burn for the LA Clippers.</p>
      <p>Foul trouble limited PG’s effectiveness, and New Orleans held off the visiting Clips 132-127.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/jrue-holiday">Jrue Holiday</a> led the way for the Pelicans with a game-high 36 points.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://apnews.com/bbc050e523d240feac1a04f80b46117a">The AP</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I thought I was terrible,” said George.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“That’s the best my shoulders have felt in a really long time, so I knew coming into tonight shooting wouldn’t be a problem,” George added. “Just playing basketball is what I’m lacking right now.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>George was playing for the first time since signing as a free agent with the Clippers because he’d been recovering from procedures in May on his right shoulder and June on his left.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“A lot of breakdowns happened because of my lack of being out there with those guys,” George said. “I’m here to win games and I didn’t get a win. … We had a chance to win tonight and a couple bad possessions in a row that we have down the stretch and we lose. That’s what I gauge good games and bad games on.”</i>
