      <p>Childline’s annual report has revealed a rise in the number of counselling sessions for children who have been sexually exploited.</p>
      <p>Counselling sessions cover issues such as grooming, sharing and receiving sexual images and messages, trafficking and sexual harassment.</p>
      <p>The 2018/19 report showed there were on average 12 counselling sessions carried out every day.</p>

      <p>The NSPCC’s round-the-clock service delivered 4,500 sessions - up 16 per cent from the previous year.</p>
      <p>In 2017/18 Childline provided a total of 3,895 sessions for those sexually exploited.</p>
      <p>This year, 2,801 sessions were with children and young people who were worried about face-to-face sexual exploitation, while there were 1,699 worried about online exploitation.</p>
      <p>In more than a third of sessions, young people disclosed that they were targeted online, often through video games or social media.</p>
      <p>Most commonly, children received help from Childline because they were forced to perform or watch sexual acts or had been persuaded into sending naked images or videos of themselves.</p>

      <p>Some young people were faced with threats over these images, being told that they would be shared with friends and family.</p>
      <p>Young people also told Childline that their experiences included receiving affection or gifts in exchange for sexual activities.</p>
      <p>Counselling sessions about sexual exploitation are a sub-concern of sexual abuse counselling.</p>
      <p>The total number of sessions for sexual abuse was 8,841 in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>The annual report also revealed the biggest jump in the amount of 16-18 year olds receiving counselling for sexual exploitation, which was up by 25 percent.</p>
      <p>Dame Esther Rantzen, Childline Founder and President, said: “This pernicious form of sexual abuse was where domestic abuse used to be.</p>
      <p>"Older people need to recognise and understand that victims feel trapped because of an overwhelming sense of shame and humiliation.</p>
      <p>"They think they will be blamed, but often they are tricked by people they believe to be genuinely in love with them."</p>

      <p>Peter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “Sadly, we are hearing from young people every day who are being manipulated or blackmailed into carrying out sexual acts.</p>
      <p>"For many this impacts on their mental health and leaves them feeling isolated from the people closest to them. Some turn to self-harm, alcohol or substance misuse as ways of coping with their experiences.</p>
      <p>“Everyone must be prepared to confront this problem, from government right through to schools, parents, professionals, and us at Childline.</p>
      <p>"The Government must ensure teachers are confident to teach the new Relationship and Sex education lessons rolling out next year, and Childline needs more volunteers to make sure they can be there for every child who needs our help, at all times of day and night.”</p>
