        <b>England's players have "moved on" from the drama of recent days and Tammy Abraham wants supporters to do the same.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/t-abrahamm-274721">Tammy Abraham</a> urged England fans to get behind the squad leading into <b>Euro 2020</b> following the<b> "unacceptable" treatment of Joe Gomez</b> on Thursday.</p>
      <p><b>Boos were heard at Wembley</b> when Liverpool defender <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/j-gomez-232599/">Gomez</a> entered the<b> 7-0 qualifying victory</b> over <b>Montenegro</b> as a second-half substitute. </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old had days earlier <b>been involved in an altercation</b> with England team-mate <b>Raheem Sterling,</b> who was subsequently <b>dropped from the matchday squad.</b></p>
      <p><b>Gareth Southgate</b> admitted to being perplexed by the reception Gomez received and Manchester City forward Sterling took to Twitter to <b>describe it as "wrong".</b></p>
      <p>Chelsea's Abraham agreed, telling reporters: <b>"We're all England, if we're players or fans".</b></p>
      <p>"We said after the game it was unacceptable.<b> We don't need that really. He's a great player.</b></p>
      <p>"Things happen in football,<b> things happen between team-mates.</b> It's about dusting yourself [off] and just moving on. As you can see, we've all done it at England,<b> we've all moved on from the situation".</b></p>
      <p><b>"We need everyone to be together</b>. At times like that, we need the fans to lift us up and help us. Going into tournaments, we need it".</p>

      <p>The booing of Gomez added <b>a sour note to what had otherwise been an exceptional outing </b>for England.</p>
      <p><b>Harry Kane marked the Three Lions' 1000th match</b> with a quickfire<b> hat-trick</b> and Southgate's men confidently confirmed their qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Abraham<b> rounded out the scoring</b> with his first international goal, a close-range finish from Jadon Sancho's pass.</p>
      <p>The striker has been in brilliant form for Chelsea this season and <b>has big ambitions for club and country.</b></p>
      <p>Asked if England can win the Euros, he replied: "I believe so. <b>Bigger dreams, hopefully.</b> Being at the Euros, winning it, top four or top two in the Premier League, just believing".</p>
      <p><b>"The sky's the limit</b>. Hopefully, hopefully – I don't want to jinx myself."</p>
