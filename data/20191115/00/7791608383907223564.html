      <h1>Instagram Is Hiding Likes Globally, Affecting A Subset Of Users In Each Country</h1>

      <p><b>Initially, Instagram announced</b> its plan to hide likes as part of an experiment <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/404389/Instagram-Is-Hiding-Likes-So-Influencers-Numbers-Mean-Less-In-The-Mobile-Era/">back in April.</a> Now, it is rolling out the test to a small percentage of people internationally. <br/><b>With the change,</b> people would have to judge for themselves whether they want to like a post, rather than following the actions of others. This may also help users post things they are interested in sharing, without worrying about the number of likes. <br/><b>The test was</b> first started in Canada back in April, and then extended to Ireland, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand in July, per <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>. <br/><b>Now, it is rolling</b> out globally. Instagram’s official Twitter account has revealed that the test has so far enjoyed positive results. However, as the change is so “fundamental,” it is working on it further before it can be implemented. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>A spokesperson</b> tells <i>TechCrunch</i> that users can still see the full list of who have liked their posts, and click on the Likers list to see the total count. Meanwhile, only a few mutual friends’ names who liked the post are visible to viewers. When they click on the Likers’ list, they have to manually count the total number of likes. <br/><b>However, the main</b> problem with the feature lies in potential loss of revenue for influencers. According to a study by <a href="https://hypeauditor.com/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>HypeAuditor</i></a>, many influencers were found to have lost 3% to 15% of their Likes in countries that have run the test. <br/><b>Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri</b> responded last week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/instagram-hide-likes-us/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Wired25</a> that the social media site would rather make decisions that “hurt the business” if the results benefit people’s “well-being.” <br/>[via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">TechCrunch</a>, cover image via <a href="https://shutterstock.7eer.net/c/1262811/42119/1305?u=https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/bangkok-thailand-november-11-2019-instagram-1556705417">Wachiwit / Shutterstock.com</a>]</p>
