      <h1>Insider buying helps drive Power Financial into the INK Canadian Insider Index</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ted Dixon</a></address>
      <p>Power Financial Corp. joined the 50-stock <a href="https://www.canadianinsider.com/stock-indices-ink-canadian-insider-index">INK Canadian Insider Index</a> on Friday with the semi-annual rebalancing. The bulk of Power Financial profits in 2018 came from the insurance area at 73 per cent, followed by 21 per cent from wealth management and 6 per cent from other businesses.</p>
      <p>Relatively attractive valuations, such as a prospective dividend yield of about 5.6 per cent and strong price momentum, have helped the stock make it into the index.</p>
      <p>Importantly, insider commitment is high with a director spending $100,015 buying shares in September.</p>
