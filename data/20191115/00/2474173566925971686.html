      <p>This week, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8602398/the-crown-season-3-trailer-prince-charles">Netflix belongs to </a><i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8602398/the-crown-season-3-trailer-prince-charles">The Crown</a></i>. The <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/netflix">streaming service</a>’s painstakingly luxurious look at the modern British monarchy returns after nearly two full years away for its third season. Now, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/olivia-colman-films">Oscar-winner Olivia Colman</a> is <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8739866/olivia-coleman-meets-prince-william-the-crown">on the throne as Queen Elizabeth II</a>, taking the Emmy-favourite drama into the 1960s and 1970s. </p>
      <p>But there’s more to everyone’s favourite streamer than the stiff upper lip of English royalty. Especially since <i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/204750/the-crown-season-3-photos-messages">The Crown </a></i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/204750/the-crown-season-3-photos-messages">doesn’t arrive until Sunday 17th November</a>. On<i> </i>Friday<i>,</i> 15thNovember, we receive a rollickingly fun docuseries starring <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/08/239894/taylor-swift-charli-xcx-comment-explained">Charli XCX</a>, a thriller led by <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/02/191457/alicia-vikander-tomb-raider-times-up-harassment-interview">an Oscar-winner</a>, an animated holiday movie, and, as usual, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/05/197972/best-netflix-foreign-series">some more bingeable foreign content</a>. </p>
      <p>The question is: what should you watch first?  </p>
      <p>We’re here to help. These are all the new Netflix offerings broken down by plot, genre, and whether you should watch something immediately or skip for now. Keep reading for the lowdown on all of these Netflix treats, including their trailers.</p>

      <p><b><i>Jeff Garlin: Our Man in Chicago<br/></i></b><b>Premiere: </b>Tuesday 12th November<br/><br/><b>What is it?: </b>Totally non-controversial fun. <br/><br/><b>What is it about?:</b> What stand-up means after nearly four decades on stage. <br/><br/>A particularly funny section of <i>Chicago </i>deals with the time <i>Curb Your Enthusiam</i>’s Jeff Garlin had his most <i>Curb</i>-y IRL moment. Parking, a broken windshield, and two bags of candy are involved. No one should spoil the rest for you. <br/><br/><b>See or skip?: </b>See if you’re a fan of Netflix’s booming stand-up genre or ABC’s <i>The Goldbergs </i>(where Garlin plays harmlessly hostile patriarch Murray). By the way, <i>The Goldbergs </i>is delightful and you should give it a chance. </p>
