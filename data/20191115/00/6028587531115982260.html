      <p><i>[</i><b><i>Update 12:30 p.m. EST 11/15:</i></b><i> The NFL announced shortly before noon it has </i><a href="https://www.steelers.com/news/nfl-steelers-browns-fined-garrett-ogunjobi-pouncey-suspended"><i>suspended Myles Garrett</i></a><i> indefinitely and two other players for shorter periods. The statement said, “Garrett violated unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct rules, as well as fighting, removing the helmet of an opponent and using the helmet as a weapon.” No condemnation or outage. The grade goes up from F- to F.]</i>No matter what the National Football League does to Myles Garrett, it already has failed when it comes to crisis response.</p>
      <p>The rest of the sporting world – including Garrett’s own Cleveland Browns teammates – immediately condemned Garrett for ripping the helmet off of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and then hitting Rudolph over the head with it near the end of Thursday night’s game in Cleveland. Watching the video replay leaves no room for question.</p>
      <p>Nearly 12 hours after the incident, the NFL is still officially silent.</p>
      <p>Maybe worse, the league’s official NFL.com web site on Friday morning appeared to be trying to downplay the incident. The site’s lead headline was, “Browns rookie shines with ‘TNF’ TD” and a photo of the touchdown. Its headline on Garrett’s action appeared below: “Myles Garrett, others ejected after late skirmish.”</p>

      <p>Skirmish? How about “assault?”</p>
      <p>By comparison, the lead at ESPN.com: “Myles Garrett clubs Mason Rudolph with helmet as fight breaks out.” Its lead image showed Garrett swinging the helmet as it is about to come down on Rudolph’s head, linking to the video.</p>
      <p>Pretty much the same at every other legitimate news source.</p>
      <p>Where is NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell? Where is the vaunted NFL PR machine? How could the editors at NFL.com essentially ignore <i>THE </i>story of the day?</p>
      <p>Sometimes silence is golden. In a crisis like this, it is inexcusable at best. Damning at worst.</p>

      <p>If you want to maintain confidence in your product when something like this happens, there is no time for a measured approach. This is time for making it absolutely clear there is no place for what happened. You may not know exactly what you are going to do about it, but you immediately must draw a clear line. Hiding in the shadows makes it look like you care more about calculating the impact to your brand than protecting a human life.</p>
      <p>Here is what should have happened last night minutes after the incident:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ring, ring.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><i>Jon Schwartz</i></b>, NFL senior vice president of Communications and Public Affairs: “Commissioner, it’s Jon. Sorry for calling you so late. Hope you weren’t in bed.”</p>
      <p><b><i>Goodell:</i></b> “No, Jon, that’s OK. I know why you’re calling. I was watching the game.”</p>
      <p><b><i>Schwartz:</i></b> “Ya, I can’t believe what Garrett did. No excuse.”</p>
      <p><b><i>Goodell:</i></b> “You’re right. That was ugly. I am sure everyone will be talking about that in the morning.”</p>
      <p><b><i>Schwartz:</i></b> “I think we need to get a statement out ASAP condemning Garrett’s action and saying we will initiate disciplinary action in the morning.”</p>
      <p><b><i>Goodell:</i></b> “What about consulting our lawyers?”</p>
      <p><b><i>Schwartz:</i></b> “There is no time for that, Commissioner. This isn’t a legal matter. It’s a matter of life and death, literally.”</p>
      <p><b><i>Goodell:</i></b> “How about if we wait to talk with the Players Union in the morning? Or call the Browns’ ownership?”</p>
      <p><b><i>Schwartz:</i></b> “Garrett’s teammates already are speaking out against him. If the union and Browns aren’t immediately condemning what happened, we don’t want to be seen standing with them. We’ve already had too many bad things happen this season. We don’t want to look like we are completely disconnected.”</p>
      <p><b><i><u>Goodell: </u></i></b>“How about if we say we don’t condone it?”</p>
      <p><b><i>Schwartz:</i></b> “There is a difference between not condoning, which means it’s not acceptable, and condemning, which means we find it reprehensible, wrong, evil.”</p>
      <p><b><i>Goodell:</i></b> “OK, you’re right. What do we say?”</p>
      <p><b><i>Schwartz:</i></b> “I just said it. ‘I, Roger Goodell, personally and the entire National Football League condemn what happened last night at the end of the Browns-Steelers game. We will address the specifics of our actions in the coming days, but you can be assured that Myles Garrett will not be participating in an NFL game for some time to come. There is no room in our league for that kind of endangering act.’ That’s it.”</p>
      <p><b><i>Goodell:</i></b> “OK, send it out. It’s going to be a long day tomorrow. Thanks, and good night.”</p>
      <p>* *</p>
      <p>As a side note, consider the difference in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/15/nfl-must-set-a-precedent-with-myles-garrett-suspension-after-ugly-incident/#322491df7728">post-game statements</a> by Brown’s quarterback Baker Mayfield and Garrett:</p>
      <p>Mayfield: “It’s inexcusable. Rivalry or not, we can’t do that. That’s endangering the other team. That’s inexcusable. The reality is, he’s going to get suspended. It’s inexcusable.”</p>
      <p>Garrett: “A win is a win. ... I don’t think it’s overshadowed by what happens in 8 seconds.”</p>
      <p>Garrett’s statement alone may be worth additional punishment. And, counseling.</p>
