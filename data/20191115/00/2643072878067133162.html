      <h1>DSS Give Reasons For Dasuki, EL-Zakzaky, Sowore’s Continued Detention</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/13/dss-finally-reveals-when-sowore-would-be-released/"><u><b>Department of State Services (DSS)</b></u></a> has explained its continued detention of Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd.), Sheik Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and Omoyele Sowore.</p>
      <p>Nigerians have condemned the security police policy of disobeying court orders and keeping notable persons undergoing trial in detention.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Friday, spokesperson of the DSS, Peter Afunanya, revealed that Dasuki, Sowore and <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/16/shiites-vs-buhari-imn-reveals-fgs-latest-plot-against-el-zakzaky-others/"><u><b>El-Zakzaky</b></u></a> requested to remain with the agency.</p>
      <p>Afunanya stated that the said individuals requested to remain in DSS facilities, adding that it was not in the character of the DSS to join issues with persons or groups.</p>
      <p>He wrote: <i>“Since their stay, the Service has continued to extend the best courtesies to them. They are allowed access to people and use of other facilities like telephones, gymnasium, TV, newspapers and medical facilities.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Among others, their families and trusted persons bring them food of their choices on a daily basis. There could not have been better treatments than these.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Against the wrong perception that the Service held these persons in defiance to Court Orders, it is obvious, by the above explanations, that they rather choose to be looked after by the DSS. The reason for such a choice is not far fetched. It is simply because the Service’s holding facilities are good and within acceptable international standards.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is not in the character of the DSS to join issues with persons or groups. Yet, silence should not be golden at a time like this. For its compliance to democratic norms, the Service owes the Nigerian public a duty to explain some of its activities. This is more so that these are oftentimes grossly misunderstood or misrepresented.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Once again, the Service restates its commitment to a strong partnership with the media and other stakeholders including opinion leaders. It is not averse to criticisms and therefore welcomes constructive engagement from all and sundry.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It will continue to conduct its operations within the bounds of the law and importantly be guided by that time tested axiom of Usman Dan Fodio that conscience is an open wound and only the truth can heal it.”</i>
