      <p>The Montreal Alouettes say they have “every expectation” of bringing coach Khari Jones back next season.</p>
      <p>Team president Patrick Boivin says the Alouettes plan to re-sign the free agent Jones to a long-term contract, and that both parties are finalizing the details.</p>
      <p>“Not only is Khari the right guy for the job, this team deserves a certain level of stability on the field, the sidelines and the front office,” Boivin said at a press conference Friday morning.</p>
      <p>“This is essential to the DNA of any championship-aspiring team. You’re not going to compete and establish yourself with eternal turnovers.”</p>
      <p>Jones, who had no previous head coaching experience, led the Alouettes to a 10-8 winning record and their first CFL playoff appearance in five years.</p>
      <p>Montreal lost to the Edmonton Eskimos in the East Division semifinal last weekend.</p>
      <p>“I’m very excited about what we’re building here, I just am,” said the 48-year-old Jones. “That’s why we’re working as hard as we can to get this done. And we’re on that track.”</p>
      <p>Jones took over from Mike Sherman at the end of pre-season, six days before the start of the regular season.</p>
      <p>The Alouettes are still without a team owner and general manager.</p>
