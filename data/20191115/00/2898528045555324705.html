      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3278/darren-till">Darren Till</a> established himself as one of the best middleweights in the UFC after beating onetime interim title challenger <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2077/kelvin-gastelum">Kelvin Gastelum</a> in his 185-pound debut. Now he’s setting his sights even higher.</p>
      <p>Till is targeting former champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1900/robert-whittaker">Robert Whittaker</a> as his ideal opponent at middleweight, and he’s not been shy about calling him out on social media.</p>
      <p>“I’m ready to fight now to be honest,” Till said. “F*ck injuries, f*ck time off, f*ck it all. When are you ready Robert Whittaker? Need to know basis.”</p>

      <p>Till continued jabbing at Whittaker throughout the day as he sought an answer to his open challenge.</p>
      <p>“It’s currently 8:42 a.m. in Melbourne, Australia,” Till wrote. “Why aren’t you returning my calls, Rob?”</p>

      <p>Whittaker had previously indicated he wanted to book his next fight sooner rather than later after a second-round knockout against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4366/israel-adesanya">Israel Adesanya</a> cost him the UFC middleweight title.</p>
      <p>The former champ took a small break afterwards, but then quickly decided to get back in action, hoping to climb back into the title race as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Till is more than willing to offer him that challenge, and he’s doing everything possible to make sure he has Whittaker’s attention.</p>
      <p>Then again, the U.K. star doesn’t want to attract the wrong kind of attention. After calling out <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/387/yoel-romero">Yoel Romero</a>, he quickly backtracked and turned his bravado into a joke when the perennial contender gave the thumbs up.</p>
      <p>Till is still willing to laugh at the whole situation, so when a fan mentioned Romero’s name, he had the perfect response.</p>

      <p><b>Update: </b>Whittaker has responded to Till’s initial tweet, suggesting a potential UFC event in London.</p>
