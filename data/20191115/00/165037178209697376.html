      <h1>Gabriel Jesus once again missed from the spot</h1>

        <b>Gabriel Jesus was the man in charge of taking the penalty which the Brazil earned in the friendly against Argentina. The striker missed the penalty, just like he did for Man City against Atalanta. In fact, the penalties were identical, only that the ball went to the other side this time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Inside the first 10 minutes in the friendly between the two teams, <b>Pezzella made a terrible error inside his own box</b> and he gave away a penalty. <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/gabriel-jesus-266974/">Gabriel Jesus</a> stepped up to take. </p>
      <p>The striker seemed calm, but when it came to hitting it,<b> he sent the ball well wide of the goal</b> with a low and tame effort which untroubled Andrada in the goal. </p>
      <p>It was interesting that<b> the mistake was identical to the terrible spot kick he hit for </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Man City</a><b> </b>against Atalanta. That said, he went to the other side on this occasion. <b>The result was the same though</b>: it was a terrible miss. </p>

      <p>To make things worse, just three minutes later, <b>Argentina won a penalty of their own.</b> Alex Sandro brought down Messi inside the box and the Barca man had the opportunity to put Scaloni's men ahead.<b> Alisson saved the penalty, but Messi was quick to react</b> to tap home the rebound. </p>
