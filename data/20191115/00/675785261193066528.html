      <h1>Great Britain players must make amends for tour defeats in Papua New Guinea clash</h1>
      <h2>Wayne Bennett has made it clear what GB need to improve as England look ahead to Australia series next year and World Cup 2021</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:11:28+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Peacock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jamie-peacock/</a></address>
      <p>It has been amazing to witness the reception Great Britain have had in Papua New Guinea and the genuine love for the sport by the local people.</p>
      <p>It's their national sport and you can see what it means to them to have the Lions playing here again for the first time in 23 years.</p>
      <p>There is so much excitement and we're expecting a sell-out crowd for our game on Saturday, so we need to perform well and win.</p>
      <p>Our last result against New Zealand was disappointing and Wayne Bennett has made it very clear what the players need to do to improve.</p>
      <p>They now need to go out and execute that. They know they are under pressure now, but pressure makes diamonds and I'm looking forward to seeing a great performance in a wonderful occasion for rugby league.</p>

      <p>Our results have not been what we wanted on the tour but let's not forget that this squad has had a lot of leadership ripped out of it.</p>
      <p>We are missing Sam Burgess, Sean O'Loughlin, James Roby and Kallum Watkins, who are all seasoned internationals.</p>
      <p>They all bring plenty to the table and any team that misses that calibre of players is going to struggle in terms of leadership and direction.</p>
      <p>We have seen that a little bit, just like Australia have with the players they have lost - it's not surprise that they've also been beaten.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But our squad is extremely together and the players know where they've gone wrong in the three Tests and what is needed.</p>
      <p>Out of our three performances so far, last week's was probably our worst in terms of being clinical and disciplined.</p>
      <p>New Zealand showed us how to do that and that's how you win at this level - you need to be disciplined with the ball and not make errors.</p>
      <p>You also have to realise that it can take 10 or 15 minutes to build pressure and it's an area we need to improve.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>If we want to beat the Australians next year and win the World Cup the year after then we need to significantly improve that.</p>
      <p>Some people say we don't have enough strength in depth in positions like centre, but strength in depth has been an issue for years with Great Britain.</p>
      <p>It was when I played. We had 12, 13 great players and you'd look at your bench and wonder if they could add anything, and beyond that we were struggling.</p>
      <p>But I really believe we have got more strength in depth than we've ever had at the moment.</p>
