      <p>World Diabetes Day: On November 14, World Diabetes Day is universally celebrated.<br/><br/>This day is meant to raise awareness about diabetes, a condition which is widely common in India.<br/><br/>Diabetes is essentially referred to a group of diseases that result in too much sugar in the blood.<br/><br/>Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes are the three kinds of diabetes. In case of type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys cells in your pancreas that make insulin.<br/><br/>Children and young adults usually suffer from type 1 diabetes, but it can occur at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin injections every day.<br/><br/>Type 2 diabetes is the more common form of diabetes. Poor lifestyle and being overweight puts you at risk of type 2 diabetes. The body is unable to make insulin well in case of this kind of diabetes. Losing weight and living a healthy lifestyle can reverse type 2 diabetes.<br/><br/>Gestational diabetes: This is the kind of diabetes that develops in pregnant women. Mostly, this kind of diabetes goes after childbirth. However, women with gestational diabetes are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.<br/><br/>Living a healthy lifestyle is an essential prerequisite to managing and regulating blood sugar and diabetes. This includes eating healthy, being regular with exercise, including strength training in your fitness routine, maintaining a healthy weight and much more.<br/><br/>We speak to nutritionist Sheela Krishnaswamy about some effective lifestyle measures to control diabetes and she says, “Blood sugar regulation is important for diabetes management. It tends to shoot up after a meal, hence what diabetes eat plays a huge role in blood sugar regulation.”<br/><br/>Lifestyle tips for blood sugar control in diabetes<br/><br/>1. A well-managed diet with a balance of carbs, protein, fat and fibre.<br/><br/>2. Foods that are rich in protein and fibre can be helpful. Almonds, fresh fruits and vegetables, walnuts, seeds, sprouts, whole grains etc are all examples of foods rich in fibre.<br/><br/>3. Check your blood sugar levels several times in a day to ensure that your numbers are fibre.<br/><br/>4. Diet needs to be modified according to the severity of the disease, a person’s weight, eating habits etc. But roughly, “diabetics can have cereal with milk and a fruit for breakfast; roti, dal, sabzi along with dahi or raita for lunch; handful of almonds or sprouts for an evening snack; your dinner can be similar to lunch, but in smaller quantities,” recommends Sheela.<br/><br/>5. Avoid refined carbs like maida and refined sugar. High-fat foods also need to be off the table for diabetics.<br/><br/>6. Include more complex carbs in your diet but in controlled proportions.<br/><br/>7. Stay away from aerated drinks and beverages if you have diabetes.<br/><br/>8. Avoid exercising on an empty stomach, unless their blood sugar levels are under control. Have a light snack before workout if you have diabetes and workout in the morning.<br/><br/>9. Quit smoking and alcohol.<br/><br/>10. Exercise regularly and be physically active. Make sure you include strength training in your fitness routine.<br/>This World Diabetes Day, pledge to check your blood sugar levels regularly and consult a qualified dietitian if your condition is not under control.
