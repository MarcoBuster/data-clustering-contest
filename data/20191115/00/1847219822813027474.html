        <b>Latvia’s State Security Service (VDD) has detained three persons for illegal supplies of arms to African countries under EU and UN sanctions, as mentioned in VDD’s report.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> November VDD performed court-sanctioned measures in Riga and its surrounding areas over suspicions of illegal arms trade activity, violation of international sanctions and money laundering. Three people were detained.</p>
      <p>«Investigative measures were performed as part of a criminal process launched on 5 February 2018 in accordance with Part 2 of Section 84 and Part 3 of Section 195 of the Criminal Law,» VDD explains.</p>
      <p>During the investigation, VDD performed five court-sanctioned searches at locations associated with the detained persons in Riga and its surrounding areas, confiscating evidence, data storage devices and documents of various kinds.</p>
      <p>VDD explains that information acquired during the investigation shows the group of persons has been performing illegal arms supply to African countries under EU and UN sanctions. The group also laundered the money gained from said illegal activities.</p>
      <p>Soon authorities will decide on application of security measures and status for the detained persons. In order to ensure the investigation proceeds unhindered, VDD does not provide further comments.</p>
