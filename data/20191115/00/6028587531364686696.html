      <h1>CX Survey: Customer Experience Still Not Much Of An Experience</h1>

      <p>A recent survey shows 90% of brands are still failing, in a big way, to meet CX expectations. It seems kind of extreme to see so much CX negativity, but the data tells the story. The <a href="https://www.acquia.com/resources/ebooks/deliver-cx-they-expect-customer-experience-trends-report">survey</a>, commissioned by Acquia, included responses from 6,013 consumers across the globe, as well as 600 marketing executives. The marketing execs are even dourer on CX than consumers: 94% agree that brands aren’t meeting experience expectations.</p>
      <p>In a separate recent <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/why-are-we-thinking-about-the-future-of-cx-when-we-cant-get-it-right-today/">article</a>, Alan J. Porter, head of strategic services for [A], a content intelligence services company, also bemoans the state of CX – and places a lot of blame on technology: “We still have too many so-called customer experience initiatives that are driven by IT systems that in fact make things that should be easy, more complex. In most cases such systems place the onus on the customer to conform to the way the company wants to run its internal operations.” Tied to un-CX-friendly technology are “false metrics that are about meeting internal efficiency goals rather than measuring the customer’s success,” Porter adds.</p>
      <p>Will artificial intelligence (AI) help or hinder? Interestingly, a majority of consumers see AI as a way to amp up CX. Fifty-three percent say they are “looking forward to artificial intelligence making interacting with brands a better experience.” Many are comfortable with the idea of interacting, by voice, with intelligent chatbots. Close to half, 44%, say they would consider engaging with a brand using voice assistance technology (i.e. Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple iHome). It’s worth noting, the researchers caution, that “only 24% strongly disagreed with this statement, pointing to the growing acceptance of voice as a brand communication channel.”</p>
      <p>Still, most consumers want human engagement in their transactions, no matter how much automation is involved. Eighty-five percent agree “a human touch is needed, in addition to technology, for a positive customer experience.” Another 75% say “the problem with automated experiences – interacting with technology instead of a real human – with brands is they are too impersonal.”</p>
      <p>The Acquia survey authors offer a way for enterprises to up their CX capabilities. Personalization is key, with four of five consumers saying “brands that know their customers best will earn their loyalty.” More than half (60%) said that brands who should know them, don’t.</p>
      <p>An additional piece of advice from the Acquia researchers is not to “over-complicate” CX. At least 90% of consumers surveyed saying a convenient experience is important, and 68% say “brands need to reduce friction and make their experience easier, which brands can do by focusing on meeting customers’ most basic expectation—convenience—and build from there.”</p>
      <p>The survey authors also urge employment of "open" technology that supports the real-time transfer of data from channel to channel, platform to platform. Technology needs to be open to integration (such as open APIs), open with regard to the data it can access and open to whatever new technologies or channels (such as AI and voice) “may become central to the brand and customer interaction in the future.” At this time, up to 64% say this integration of technologies has not happened.</p>
      <p>It all boils down to the most fundamental concept of business: serve the customer, serve the customer, serve the customer. Many business leaders believe dropping expensive technology solutions into their organizations will fix their hidebound approaches and rigid, standoffish relationships with the people that pay for their products and services. Time to turn this thinking around.</p>
