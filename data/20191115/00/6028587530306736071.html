      <p>The UFC is in Brazil for the third and final time in 2019 on Saturday for the ESPN+ streaming UFC Fight Night 164 card. In the headlining bout, Jan Blachowicz welcomes Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza to the light heavyweight division. This is the second fight in a row where Blachowicz has faced a former middleweight. In July, he faced former UFC middleweight titleholder Luke Rockhold in Rockhold’s first fight in the light heavyweight division. Blachowicz knocked out Rockhold at the 1:39 mark of the second round of that contest. Blachowicz is the No. 6 ranked fighter in the official UFC light heavyweight rankings.  </p>
      <p>In the co-main event, former UFC light heavyweight champion Mauricio “Shogun” Rua fights in his home country of Brazil for the first time since he knocked out Gian Villante in the co-main event of UFC Fight Night 106 in March 2017. Rua, who is the No. 14 ranked fighter in the official UFC light heavyweight rankings, faces the unranked Paul Craig in this matchup.</p>
      <p>Also on the main card, submission ace Charles Oliveira looks to extend his winning streak to six when he faces Jared Gordon. Oliveira has finished his past five opponents. He has not gone the distance since he scored a decision over Jeremy Stephens in December 2014. Oliveira is the No. 13 ranked fighter in the official UFC lightweight rankings. The unranked Gordon is 3-2 in the UFC. </p>
      <p>UFC Fight Night 164 takes place at Ginasio do Ibirapuera in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The entire card streams on ESPN+. Prelims begin at 5 p.m. ET, followed by the main card at 8 p.m. ET.</p>
      <p>Before the fighters step into the octagon on Saturday, they will hit the scales. The ceremonial weigh-ins take place Friday. The first fighter is set to hit the scale at 4 p.m. ET.  </p>
