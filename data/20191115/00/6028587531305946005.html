      <p>U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel has claimed that if re-elected, her party the Conservatives would <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50412772">reduce immigration to the country</a>, though in very much her own style of not specifying at all how that would work, and somewhat in contradiction with her own party's policies.“The Conservatives will get Brexit done, end free movement and introduce an Australian-style points system so that we can control our borders and protect our public services” said Patel on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors. This can only happen if people vote for a Conservative majority government so we can leave the EU with a deal.”</p>
      <p>This is quite in keeping with Patel’s tenure as Home Secretary so far: promising to cut immigration without explaining how she would do it, short of wanting to introduce an “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2019/06/27/boris-johnson-proposes-australian-style-visa-system-which-doesnt-mean-much/">Australian-style</a>” points-based system which, as has been explored many times before, doesn’t mean much. The U.K. already has a points-based system for non-EU migrants, and saying the Conservatives want to extend that to EU citizens post-Brexit is tantamount to saying “we would like to have an immigration system after Brexit.”</p>
      <p>When Patel first became Home Secretary she drew scorn for pledging to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after what was then meant to be Brexit day (October 31st). It was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2019/08/22/migration-researchers-point-out-you-cant-just-end-freedom-of-movement-after-brexit/#1b20f0aee2c5">swiftly pointed out</a> that would be near impossible, as there would be no way to distinguish between EU citizens who were already resident in the U.K., and therefore had the provisional right to stay, and those only just arriving. Indeed, this was an issue raised in the previous Home Secretary’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/no-deal-immigration-arrangements-for-eu-citizens-moving-to-the-uk-after-brexit">2018 policy paper </a>on a post-Brexit immigration system, making it quite hard to believe Patel was unaware of it.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have a patchy record on immigration promises in general. Quietly scrapped in the current Conservative platform is a pledge to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands per year, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/6961675/David-Cameron-net-immigration-will-be-capped-at-tens-of-thousands.html">a promise made </a>by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010 and consistently not delivered since then (net migration to the U.K. is currently around 250,000 per year). That Patel has dropped this pledge is perhaps a tacit acknowledgement it is simply not possible.</p>
      <p>Whether or not a future Conservative-led Home Office would lead to lower immigration is still highly dependent on whether the U.K. leaves the European single market, which mandates freedom of movement. Even if the country does indeed leave, the party has been sending mixed signals on what they plan to do. Early in November, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-home-office-conservatives-policy-victoria-atkins-a9194841.html">refused to say</a> whether immigration would be lower after Brexit, and admitted they did not yet have a policy plan on immigration. This makes Priti Patel’s promise to lower immigration somewhat dubious.</p>
      <p>And in fact, even leaving the single market, and therefore freedom of movement for EU citizens, might not be the magic bullet supporters of lower immigration are dreaming about. According to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, non-EU migrants (the ones already subject to a points-based visa system) outnumber EU citizens (the ones with free movement) <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/eu-migration-to-and-from-the-uk/">by over 2 million</a>. And that doesn't seem likely to change. In 2018 non-EU migration <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/long-term-international-migration-flows-to-and-from-the-uk/">was far higher than EU migration</a>, with some estimates putting it at three times higher (though there is currently some dispute about official migration statistics in the U.K. See the caveat on the Migration Observatory page).</p>
      <p>Madeleine Sumption, Director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said: “It’s uncontroversial to suggest that ending EU freedom of movement will probably reduce immigration to the U.K. Any scheme that requires people to get permission to come to the U.K. rather than granting them that right automatically can be expected to cut numbers.”</p>
      <p>But though leaving the single market and free movement probably will reduce immigration, given the numbers above, it's not going to be the massive drop people are allegedly hoping for.</p>
      <p>In fact, one of the few policy plans we do know about from Home Secretary Patel would be more likely to increase migration than decrease it. In September it was announced foreign students in the U.K. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2019/09/11/uk-government-offers-students-more-generous-visa-to-address-stem-skills-shortage/#33797c9638b0">would be given two years</a> in the country to find work after graduating, up from four months. How that's meant to reduce immigration is unclear.</p>
      <p>"In terms of the policy changes (the Conservatives) have put in place and their policy intent, they've actually gone for a more liberal approach," says Joe Owens, Brexit programme director at the Institute for Government. "So there's a bit of a contradiction, in terms of the the rhetoric that's coming out and the actual policy changes."</p>
      <p>But Patel doesn’t necessarily need to deliver on all these promises for them to be politically effective. As a continuation of the “hostile environment” strategy, signalling to immigrants they are not welcome in the U.K. in order to encourage them to leave or not come at all, bold promises like these could be read as an attempt to win points with the Brexiteer crowd, to whom Patel is clearly trying to appeal.</p>
      <p>But whatever is actually in Priti Patel's heart, Joe Owens at the Institute for Government points out that during an election campaign incentives can be different and behaviour harder to analyze: "Labour (the opposition party) talk about continuing free movement. So is it that the Conservatives see a greater message of control on immigration as a dividing line that they can push during an election campaign?"</p>
      <p>Indeed, around the same time Patel said she wants to lower immigration, she also tried to cast Labour as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/tories-accused-fake-news-attack-labour-immigration-plan-11124766/">rabidly pro-immigration</a>. In an open letter to shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott, Patel alleged a motion passed at the Labour party conference to “maintain and extend” freedom of movement would result in a near quadrupling of net migration to the U.K., from around 250,000 per year up to <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dcc26bae7d2fd647c40576b_Jeremy%20Corbyn%E2%80%99s%20plan%20for%20uncontrolled%20and%20unlimited%20immigration.pdf">840,000 per year</a>.</p>
      <p>This figure is conditional, however, on the U.K. opening up freedom of movement to the entire planet, which by all accounts is not actually part of the motion. Diane Abbott responded by calling the claim “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/conservatives-pledge-to-cut-overall-immigration">fake news</a>”.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, this allegation and the promise to reduce immigration are by far the most prominent things Priti Patel has done in a while, and whether it's due to hidden incentives, Brexit obstacles or a simple inability to come up with a plan, there remains little to go on for an idea of Britain's post-Brexit immigration policy.</p>
      <p>Joe Owens says there might actually be something else going on that would explain Patel's strong rhetoric but relative inaction. He thinks immigration policy might be coming more directly from the Prime Minister than it has in the past, somewhat bypassing the Home Office. For instance, he points out that when the extended post-study visa was announced, it was Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49655719">did the media rounds</a> to promote it, not the minister directly responsible for immigration.</p>
      <p>Owens says this could signal a movement "away from immigration being seen as purely a Home Office area and actually more (to do with) important economic decisions while the Home Office, though having operational responsibility for it, have got less of a policy control than they perhaps used to have."</p>
