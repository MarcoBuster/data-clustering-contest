      <p>JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) – Algeria thrashed Zambia 5-0 on Thursday in a successful start to the defence of their continental crown, winning their opening qualifier for the 2021 African Cup of Nations 117 days after lifting the trophy.</p>
      <p>Baghdad Bounedjah scored twice, one from the penalty spot, with Ramy Bensebaini, Youssef Belaili and substitute El Arabi Hilal Soudani completing a pleasing performance for the home fans in Blida.</p>
      <p>Thomas Partey’s long-range shot gave Ghana the lead and 19-year-old debutant Mohammed Kudus added the second in a 2-0 home win over South Africa in Cape Coast, but Egypt, who hosted the finals this year, were held 1-1 at home by Kenya.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah’s absence due to an ankle injury left Egypt looking ineffective in attack although they did take the lead when Mahmoud Kahraba picked up on a weak back pass.</p>
      <p>Michael Olunga stunned the home crowd in Alexandria with a 67th-minute equaliser for Kenya.</p>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang captained Gabon as they forced a goalless draw away to Democratic Republic of Congo in Kinshasa while Mali twice surrendered the lead as they were held 2-2 by Guinea, for who Naby Keita scored their first goal.</p>
      <p>The Comoros Islands, who only became FIFA members in 2005, notched their first away win in a competitive international as Faiz Selemani scored early in the second half to beat Togo 1-0 in Lome.</p>
      <p>The small Indian Ocean island nation host Egypt on Monday, looking to keep up their giant-killing start in Group G.</p>
      <p>Mozambique beat Rwanda 2-0 at home in Thursday’s other qualifier.</p>
      <p>Qualifiers continue through to Tuesday, by which time each of the 48 participating countries will have played two matches each.</p>
      <p>The top two in each of the 12 groups advance to the finals, to be hosted in Cameroon in mid-2021.</p>
