        <b>Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill plans to remain in charge should his country reach the Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs despite his impending move to Stoke.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Northern Ireland host the Netherlands in what could be O'Neill's <b>final match in charge at Windsor Park</b> on Saturday after he was announced as Stoke's new boss last week.</p>
      <p>With Stoke battling to <b>climb away from the Championship relegation zone</b>, it has been suggested O'Neill would leave regardless of whether Northern Ireland reach the play-offs.</p>
      <p>But on Friday he said he will <b>remain in charge of Northern Ireland until the end of their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign</b>, whether that ends in the next seven days or extends into March.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was committed to staying for the rest of the campaign, O'Neill said: "That's the plan at the minute."</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland face the Netherlands this weekend and Germany in Frankfurt on Tuesday in their final Group C fixtures, knowing automatic qualification is highly unlikely.</p>
      <p>They are however currently well placed for the play-offs.</p>

      <p>Insisting the Stoke job hasn't been a distraction, O'Neill said: "The week has been no different from any other week. We've got the work done. The players have been very focused, <b>maybe more so because they're thinking, as a club manager I might sign them.</b>"</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland can take encouragement from their performance in Rotterdam, where <b>Holland needed two stoppage-time goals</b> to complete a come-from-behind 3-1 win last month.</p>
      <p>But, regardless of the result in Belfast, O'Neill isn't thinking about a fond farewell just yet.</p>
      <p>"I haven't thought about it to be honest. <b>I'm not one for big emotion</b>," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'll just try and prepare the team as well as we can. The main thing is to try and get a result and take it to the last game.</p>
      <p>"Maybe I'm young enough to come back in the future!"</p>
