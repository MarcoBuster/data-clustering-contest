      <p>Employee activism is on the rise. Late last month, hundreds of Facebook employees sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg and other senior leaders registering their displeasure with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/technology/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-political-ads.html">company's hands-off</a> position on political advertising. Likewise, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-19/amazon-climate-change">Amazon </a>employees demanded the company take more aggressive actions related to climate change. These days many employees expect their companies to take a stand on social and political issues. And they aren't reluctant to say so. Over the next few weeks, I will tackle the topic of employee activism from a variety of perspectives, including how to ensure that it strengthens your company, ways employers and employees can prepare for it, and how to maximize the engagement and minimize the stress that comes from it. To kick off the series, I examine how to integrate discussions of activism into the recruitment and job interview processes.</p>
      <h3>The Case of Mismatched Expectations</h3>
      <p>Phil is a Millennial who describes himself as an activist. He has a straightforward communication style, and he addresses conflict directly. Phil was both flattered and excited when a well-known, purpose-driven company recruited him. He accepted their offer because he believed their values aligned with his. He anticipated a job where his skills would result in a clear social impact. However, he has been disappointed that his employer is not more progressive. He claims the company will not take stands on many issues that border on political.</p>
      <p>The senior leaders maintain they can do better in carrying out their mission and promoting change by staying out of the political fray. On the other hand, Phil argues that by not speaking out, they are implicitly supporting the status quo. He is frustrated and exhausted from engaging leaders in this debate. Yet he believes that it is his responsibility to continue to push the company to become more progressive and to take stands on significant social issues related to their purpose. </p>

      <h3>How Interivews Miss the Mark</h3>
      <p>How did Phil and the company fail to grasp the disconnects in expectations and understandings during the lengthy recruitment and interviewing process? Typically job interviews do not examine purpose and values in a deep and meaningful way. Therefore, most likely, Phil and his interviewers fell into the trap of making assumptions that proved to be mistaken in the long run.</p>
      <p>Often the personality, style, or credentials of the prospective employee captures the interest of the interviewers and can override the consideration of any possible concerns. Likewise, a company's strong reputation or the chemistry between the interviewer and interviewee might prevent the prospective employee from asking hard questions that could shed light on the differences in expectations.</p>
      <p>In a recent study, research and consulting firm, <a href="http://www.povaddo.com/downloads/Povaddo_Corporate_America's_POV_(2017_Presentation_Deck).pdf">Povaddo</a>, found that over half of people working in large American corporations believe that Corporate America needs to play a more active role in addressing critical societal issues. Therefore, the time is right to incorporate a discussion of attitudes towards activism into the interviewing process. Ultimately these conversations will enable both the company and the prospective employee to make better decisions on the degree to which they are a good match.</p>
      <h3>Incorporate a Discussion of Activism into the Interview</h3>
      <h4>Interviewers</h4>
      <p>If you are the interviewer representing the employing company, consider discussing the organization's purpose, mission, and values with the prospective employee.</p>
      <p>These conversations must be more robust than merely presenting the company's official statements carefully written by a communications or public relations specialist. Instead, discuss how these foundational elements of your company guide decisions and behaviors. Give concrete examples. </p>
      <p>Clarify the boundaries for values-based behaviors. Explain the expectations of what employees should and should not do in the name of the company.</p>
      <p>Talk over the company's position on activism. Explain the process for deciding whether to jump into the debate or act on timely and controversial issues. And if the company doesn't have a process, develop one.</p>
      <p>Ask the interviewees to describe how their values guide their behaviors. Seek out specific examples.</p>
      <p>Consider inquiring how they might handle a situation where they don't agree with the company on the appropriate actions to take to address social or political issues. </p>
      <h4>Interviewee</h4>
      <p>If you are the interviewee, you must ask the tough questions so that you can evaluate the fit between the company and your values and expectations.</p>
      <p>Ask the interviewers for examples of how their values show up in concrete behaviors.</p>
      <p>Find out whether they have a framework for deciding if or when to tackle political or social issues publicly.</p>
      <p>Ask them how they stay on top of employees' attitudes and needs.</p>
      <p> Probe for how they handle employee/employer disagreements.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>These conversations aren't as much fun as talking about where the interviewees went to school and what they like to do in their spare time. Thoughtful discussions aimed at uncovering similarities and differences in expectations can be uncomfortable. Yet any uneasiness experienced in the interview pales in comparison to the distress that can result from unexamined assumptions and disconnects in hopes.</p>
      <h3>Employee Activism is Gaining Momentum</h3>
      <p>Employee activism is not going away. Indeed it will continue to grow as generations shift in the workforce. A <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html">study of Millennials</a> conducted by multinational professional services network, Deloitte, shows that younger workers are more likely than their predecessors to seek employers whose values align with their own. Moreover, other <a href="http://www.povaddo.com/survey.html">recent research indicates</a> that over half of the people who comprise the current workforce feel that Corporate America needs to play a more active role in addressing critical societal issues.</p>
      <p>Thus the trend towards employee activism is likely to gain momentum over the foreseeable future. All companies must consider how they will address it. And all prospective employees should reflect on how their values and expectations will affect their work decisions. Start by exploring similarities and differences during the initial job interviewing process.</p>
