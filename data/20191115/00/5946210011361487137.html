      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/the-new-yorker" target="_blank">The New Yorker</a></address>
      <p>House Democrats have begun the public phase of their impeachment inquiry, holding open hearings in which they will build the case that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">President Trump</a> abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his potential political rival <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>. To track the Democrats’ case as it unfolds, <i>New Yorker</i> writers are identifying key moments in the witnesses’ testimonies. Brief excerpts from the hearings and our writers’ commentary will be compiled and updated here throughout the inquiry.</p>
