      <h1>These Photos Of Women Affected By Illegal Abortion Are Deeply Moving (NSFW)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jazmin Kopotsha</a></address>
      <p>Scotland-based photographer <a href="https://www.camilacavalcante.com/">Camila Cavalcante</a> spent the last three years working on a project to <a href="https://refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8572968/imacriminal-abortion-campaign">push the conversation about abortion</a> and scream for <a href="https://refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8540490/abortion-buffer-zones-uk-review">all women to have autonomy over their own bodies,</a> regardless of their circumstances.</p>
      <p>In Brazil where she grew up, abortion is only legal if it endangers the mother’s life, if the foetus’ brain doesn’t develop in the womb or in rape cases. Updates to abortion law and the fight for reproductive rights continue all over the world while women are still forced to take dangerous avenues to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Between 2016 and 2019, Camila photographed herself with 50 women from different backgrounds with different stories, all united by having been affected by illegal abortions. The result is an incredibly moving photobook, <i>For The Lives Of All Women</i>, which combines the personal and the political, documenting their individual experiences and <a href="https://refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8573191/diane-munday-abortion-campaigner">why things so desperately need to change for everyone.</a></p>
      <p>"I have taken nude self-portraits holding and hugging these women, their backs to the camera, identity protected, whilst I reveal my face, exposing my body and identity in their name," Camila writes in the book’s introduction. She adds: "Exposing my face and identity in the names of women who have risked so much was my way of supporting their decision and moving the focus of judgement away from them."</p>
      <p>To protect the women’s anonymity, each photograph is captioned with "Nós por Todas em", which is Portuguese for "Us for All", and the year they experienced an illegal abortion. From those who were highly educated and able to afford professional help to those who relied on homemade 'abortion teas' or abortion pill dealers, ahead you’ll find the stories of some incredible women. "This project is about continuing the debate around abortion and bringing people together in the fight for reproductive rights," says Camila. "It is about sharing experiences and breaking stereotypes. It’s about reaching and supporting women around the world who are being judged and persecuted because they dared to decide what to do with their own bodies. It is about trusting women."</p>

      <p><b>Nós por Todas em 1991</b><br/><i><b>Us for All Women </b></i><b><i>1991</i><br/></b><br/>"It was crazy, I was desperate. I thought I would have the support of my sisters: strength from woman to woman. I was counting on my family but they weren’t there for me. The support I needed was to aid my safety. The problem with illegal abortions is that they make you feel very vulnerable: physically and emotionally.<br/><br/>Decades later, when I was in a different spiritual place, Catholic guilt struck me. I don’t know how to explain it. Even now I don’t feel ashamed and I don’t feel guilty, but if I think of it in a spiritual sense, there is an empty space. Then when I was 37, I got pregnant again and had a miscarriage. That’s when that empty space grew worse.<br/><br/>However, I never wanted to be a mother and it has never crossed my mind that I need to be a mother to be happy. Not having kids does not afflict me. I think motherhood is beautiful for those who want it."</p>

      <p><b>Nós Por Todas em 1996-2</b><br/><br/>"Whether it was legal or illegal wasn’t<br/>important to me at the time. I was 14 years old when I found out I was pregnant and was with my first boyfriend. I had no intention of marrying him or having a baby then. I had many dreams, so what could I do? I remember buying a box of abortion pills and taking them. I had strong bleeding and pelvic pain but it was gone. After that, I didn’t want to have sex anymore out of fear and trauma.<br/><br/>Later those feelings became demons in my head. When I got pregnant again and actually wanted the baby, I was sure that my child would have some sort of congenital problem because I’d had an abortion in the past. It would have been my penance. I was really paranoid about it, but everything was ok and my son was born healthy.<br/><br/>I am a nurse and when I started working in a hospital I saw some really ugly, sad scenes. Young women who had had abortions in the most bizarre conditions would get to the hospital looking for help and the treatment they received was inadequate. They would arrive bleeding, but as a punishment, other<br/>people who weren’t as ill would have priority. They did something ‘wrong’ so they had to wait, they had to suffer.<br/><br/>These things happened openly. There I was, a woman who had had an abortion, reflecting on myself as a nurse. I couldn’t accept that they treated women this way, but I couldn’t say anything because I would have been discriminated against in my workplace. That anguished me."</p>

      <p><b>Nós Por Todas em 2005<br/></b><br/>"You face judgement from other people at all stages. On my journey, I did not find a single person who understood me and no one gave me support.<br/><br/>When I found out I was pregnant, I knew I didn’t want to have the baby. The father was the first person I talked to. I told him I didn't want it and asked for his help. His reaction was, ‘It’s not my problem, there’s nothing I can do’. After that, I cut all ties with him. He was an idiot who didn’t have any empathy for the human being in front of him.<br/><br/>I didn’t know who else I could talk to. My family was putting a lot of pressure on me not to tell anyone. I couldn’t talk to my friends or anyone else. I talked to a doctor and he only spoke to me about the moral side of having an abortion. He told me that what I was doing was wrong, as if any part of this hellish process was easy."</p>

      <p><b>Nós Por Todas em 2011</b><br/><b><br/></b>"My story of terminating a pregnancy is a safe one: it was in a clinic, with a quick surgical procedure, painless and with no repercussions for my health. I was privileged to live in an environment that allowed me to empower myself to make this decision. I had a socio-economic advantage and was able to look for a place that would not scar me, that would not mutilate me, that would not leave me with any painful consequences of my decision.<br/><br/>Illegality: that is the shadow, the weight. You can’t speak openly about what happened. I don’t think I should be ashamed to talk about abortion but I don’t feel free to talk about my own experience. Illegality is what stops us from living it collectively, from overcoming our individual experiences.<br/><br/>It is a woman’s right. It is the expression of her autonomy to claim uncompromising power over her own body and the determination of her own future. It is overcoming motherhood as a biological destiny. We need to radically defend women as human beings, as complete and powerful agents who can exercise their right to life and freedom."</p>

      <p><b>Nós Por Todas em 2013-2</b><br/><br/>"The first thing that comes to my mind is the lack of support. It’s knowing that you’re alone at that moment, with no support structure from the health system or society. It’s the fear of how people are going to react when they find out. The way in which you’ll be seen at the hospital when they realise you’ve had an abortion. That weight is on you.<br/><br/>I think that the necessary support for abortion must exist and should be assisted by the national health system so that we can live the life we want to live. Women won’t have more abortions if it is legal; the middle-class have easy access already and the poor have unsafe abortions and are damaged. What we really need is medical and psychological support so that we do not feel guilty about it."</p>

      <p><b>Nós Por Todas em 2013</b><br/><br/>"Abortion is something that nobody wants to do. Nobody goes through it easily. <br/><br/>I got the phone number of the clinic and called: it was a gamble. When my friend took his girlfriend for an abortion, it was in a beautiful, clean place and she was treated very well. When I went, it was in a little room inside some isolated military accommodation. The stretcher was covered with a beach towel. It was chaos.<br/><br/>After the procedure, I was deeply affected and in a lot of pain. It was really bad. Two days later I was having a shower and something came out of me. I panicked and thought, ‘I had an abortion and they didn’t take everything away, they left something rotting inside me.’"</p>

      <p><b>Nós Por Todas em 2017-4</b><br/><br/>"He said that he wanted to have a family with me and that he loved me. Then, unexpectedly, he told me that wasn’t what he meant, that he was not ready to be a father, and that the choice to have the child or not was up to me.<br/><br/>What choice was that? Have a baby alone again while he would be a father when it suited him or not have a baby. I see that as an appropriation of feminist speech: it was convenient for him that the ‘choice’ was mine.<br/><br/>The moment I found out I was pregnant was when I needed him most. I made the choice to have an abortion because he said that he didn’t want to be with me anymore. I wanted to have a baby with him by my side, with his support. I didn’t want to change my life completely and end up on my own with a child."</p>

      <p><b>Nós Por Todas em 2017-5</b><br/><br/>"It was a sexual assault and it had happened once before. He took me by force and I spent 20 minutes fighting, trying to get away. Then I let go; I was tired of fighting. That time I got pregnant. He did it on purpose because he knew I was ovulating.<br/><br/>I managed to get a legal abortion but the process was psychological torture. I gave up twice because two people came to convince me not to do it. You can change your mind about having an abortion but you should do it for your own reasons, not because someone with different beliefs wants to influence your decision and your life. You can be easily persuaded by others when you are in a vulnerable situation, but it has to be your own choice."</p>
