      <h1>Should Medical Schools Test Applicants For Empathy?</h1>

      <p>In most cases, it takes a number of human interactions to build trust between two people – or develop the assurance that the other person’s character and abilities are worth us risking our sense of self. But when it comes to providing health care, putting your trust in another person can mean the difference between sickness and health, or life and death. In fact, research has shown that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22836852">doctors who are more empathetic</a> (meaning they possess a cognitive attribute that involves understanding a patient’s perspective and an ability to communicating this understanding, with an intention to help) are more trusted, and thus have better patient outcomes and demonstrate <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21248604">greater clinical competence</a>. “When patients feel like their doctor cares about and understands them, they are more likely to trust,” explains <a href="https://www.jefferson.edu/university/skmc/research/research-medical-education/team/hojat.html">Mohammadreza Hojat, Ph.D.,</a> professor of psychiatry and human behavior and Director of the Jefferson Longitudinal Study at Thomas Jefferson University. He adds, “Patients who trust their doctors are likely to reveal more about their lifestyle and other factors relevant to their illness, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatments.” Patient compliance also improves when trust develops in physician-patient relationships, meaning patients are more likely to follow instructions, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/765597">including medication adherence</a> and changing harmful habits.</p>
      <p>The growing body of evidence signals that knowing the patient is just as important as knowing the disease. Yet, as Dr. Hojat puts it, “Medical schools are teaching the science of medicine, but benignly neglect the art of medicine.” Which many see as a problem, given that both are necessary for the patient-physician interpersonal relationship.</p>
      <p>Knowing that bedside manner really does make a difference in patient care and outcomes has led Dr. Hojat to contend that we should include empathy testing as a component for admission to American medical schools.</p>
      <p>This assertion is not the first call to revisit (<a href="https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2019/09/its-time-to-abolish-the-mcat.html">or even abolish</a>) current standardized testing for admission to medical school in the U.S. The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is a singular test that claims to predict future accomplishment in medical school. However, research (<a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/residents-students/preparing-medical-school/mcat-scores-and-medical-school-success-do-they">and the American Medical Association website</a>) suggest that MCAT scores are not strongly correlated to actual medical performance or professional skills.</p>
      <p>The researchers at Thomas Jefferson University are therefore arguing to add a component to admission requirements. “Testing for empathy should not replace the traditional admissions process,” says Dr. Hojat. However, it might add great value in helping medical schools select individuals who rank high on empathic orientation toward patient care as well as academic capabilities. But what makes this proposal challenging is that it requires to convince the credentialing and decision-making bodies agree to system-wide change. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Can We Assign A Score For Empathy?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Based on research recently published in the <a href="https://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2739375"><i>Journal of the American Osteopathic Association</i></a>, it is possible to measure empathic orientation toward patient care in medical school applicants. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12047665"><u>Research showed that</u></a> medical school applicants with higher empathy scores will not only be higher performers of clinical competence, but will also have better patient outcomes than those with lower empathy scores. In testing this theory, Dr. Hojat and colleagues developed the <a href="https://www.jefferson.edu/university/skmc/research/research-medical-education/jefferson-scale-of-empathy.html">Jefferson Scale of Empathy</a> (JSE) and “<a href="https://www.jefferson.edu/content/dam/university/skmc/research/centerResearch/List-of-Jefferson-Scales-w-Article-Ref.pdf">10 psychometrically sound instruments</a>” to research personal qualities of physicians-in-training and in-practice. </p>
      <p>According to Dr. Hojat, the Jefferson Scale took years of psychometric research to ensure that the scale is valid and reliable. The perceived success of the scale has already led to its translation into 57 languages, and current use in more than 85 countries, as of 2019.</p>
      <p>At present, the team at the <a href="https://www.aacom.org/">American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine</a> are undertaking a seven-year nationwide Project in Osteopathic Medical Education and Empathy (POMEE) that consists of a two-year cross-sectional study (Phase I) and a five-year prospective longitudinal study (Phase II) to study empathy, its correlates, and changes in empathy as students progress through medical school. Further, they are looking into changes in student empathy and reasons for such changes as they progress through medical education and training, in hopes of better understanding if empathetic behaviors can be taught, developed, maintained, or enhanced as a person progresses through their career.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will It Make A Difference?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When asked what he ultimately hopes to accomplish by endorsing an empathy test for medical school applicants, Dr. Hojat asserts that he hopes to restore the public’s perception of doctors as trustworthy and empathic caregivers. He points to the rise of market-driven medical practices moving us away from compassionate care, which has led to an erosion in the public’s trust. A also points to a recent study suggesting that patients of <a href="https://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2738501">D.O.s (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) reported more favorable perceptions of their doctors than patients of M.D.s</a> - probably as a result of a more holistic care approach.</p>
      <p>This is why the research team has chosen to employ their current nationwide study in colleges of osteopathic medicine. The investigators have already developed a <a href="https://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2739375">set of national norms</a>, which can serve as a benchmark for evaluating future medical school applicants’ fit to the medical profession.</p>
      <p>And what they’ve discovered about empathy thus far indicates that it not only makes a difference, but that it changes – in unexpected ways. Of particular interest are the findings that<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23758178"> suggest empathy actually decreases in medical students</a> as students progress through medical school. This is found to be especially true in the third year, when <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19707055">erosion of empathy is noted across cohorts</a>, but shown to be greatest for those that start medical school with lower than average Jefferson Scale empathy scores. </p>
      <p>If true, this means that beyond preemptive testing for empathy on the MCAT, training and study dedicated to compassionate care need to become a priority of medical education, activities, and coursework, especially for those with low level of empathy.</p>
      <p>While Dr. Hojat agrees that there need to be classes and workshops in school to improve skills in empathy, compassion and relationship-building, he still believes that in admission decisions, those applicants that have the best potential to become caring physicians should be ranked higher than peers who are less likely. According to him, it’s a, “Social and ethical responsibility to choose qualified applicants that have the potential to become caring physicians. Think about it. Do you need a better, more caring physician, or do you just want a physician who can pass a test on factual information?” For now, that answer ultimately falls to medical school decisionmakers and credentialing services.</p>
