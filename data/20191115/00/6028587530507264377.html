      <p><b>1989-1991</b> - I started my career off as a media buyer at a political buying service called Target Enterprises.<b>1991-2004</b> – I transitioned to the cable industry and started working at Adlink, the first cable interconnect in the country. I was part of the cable boom through the 90’s. It was a very unique time in the media industry and the growth I experienced as a young professional was quite extraordinary. Lots of creative selling and big category breakthroughs. </p>
      <p><b>2004-2006</b> – I was approached by an investment banker from Lehman Brothers who worked in the entertainment division. After realizing how profitable the TV business was, he quit his job to launch a new local television network in Los Angeles called LTN (Local Television Network), modeled after CityTV from Canada. He courted me for about 10 months while I was at Adlink and finally it made sense for me to make the move. I came in as the SVP of Sales and Marketing. This network was lifestyle focused which consisted of fashion, nightlife, music, action sports, food and a daily entertainment show. While it was an incredible experience and we had revenues (exceeding $1M) at launch, the founder was unable to raise his next round based on the valuation he set with his first investor and was not willing to dilute him by lowering the valuation.  The cost to run this endeavor out weighed the current revenues and without the additional capital unfortunately it failed.</p>

      <p><b>2006-current</b> – in 2005 YouTube launched, I was now bit as an entrepreneur and went off to do due diligence and model my own lifestyle destination that could live on the web and work towards defining a new type of production infrastructure that consisted of all freelance documentary filmmakers from around the country that I discovered through exploring YouTube.  My prototype soft launch was in October 2006 in just a few cities. This was a defining moment for me to create a storytelling platform that gave filmmakers a home to celebrate culture in the city they lived in and get paid to do it. The name of this new platform would be called VIMBY (Video In My Backyard), a play on showcasing backyards (local) across America.  In April of 2007 I officially launched VIMBY in 20 cities.VIMBY was a groundbreaking consumer destination that was challenged by monetization. Building a destination website was very expensive. The VIMBY video player was everywhere on the web, embedded by bloggers and bands on MySpace. We would do 500,000 views in a couple of hours but these views were happening off the VIMBY platform and unfortunately at this time bloggers and MySpace wouldn’t allow us to run ads within our video player .  While I was building something very special, I self funded VIMBY for the first 2.5 years. It came time that I had to pivot but attract an investor that valued my unique production infrastructure. In March 2010, Mark Burnett invested in VIMBY and VIMBY became the Mark Burnett Content Studio. This was game changing. I was enamored by Burnett and shifted from a destination to a brand studio. The VIMBY infrastructure became a massive toolkit for brands and we went off to develop substantial relationships with large CPG and big box retail. As you can imagine local for retail and CPG was invaluable. In 2013 Walmart awarded VIMBY with the Marketing Supplier of the Year Award. This was an award that has never been given to an ad agency but VIMBY had such a substantial impact on Walmart’s grocery business that they recognized us. By this time, VIMBY was now locally based in 80 cities, with crews creating content in multiple languages. In Dec 2015 Mark Burnett Productions was purchased by MGM for a substantial amount of money.  VIMBY now had a partnership with MGM. In early 2016 I started to recognize what was happening in the cannabis industry and shared my thoughts with Burnett. Unfortunately, due to Mark’s high profile in Hollywood he was not willing to attach himself to anything cannabis related. As it turns out, VIMBY received an offer from MGM but not where we felt our value was, so we made MGM an offer and bought our equity back. This now officially freed me up to explore cannabis. I spent the next 12 months doing due diligence and spent some real time with a few large players in the cannabis space, from directory models to hydroponics. While at the time it didn’t seem like the right fit and was a bit early (pre-recreational) to really get things done, I had enough information over those 12 months to start modeling a business in cannabis. As a marketer, a lover of the cannabis plant and of course, some personal stories where the plant would’ve saved a few lives. I decided to hire some new executives on the VIMBY side and 100% dedicate myself to a new cannabis venture. This was the beginning of Flowertown. I courted some of my favorite people from the agency side, told them about my vision and surprisingly they all joined me for many of the same reasons why I dedicated myself to this new venture. We spent many nights and weekends moonlighting and modeling.</p>

      <p><b>2018-current</b> - Fast forward to March 2018, we raised an initial friends and family round, everyone quit their jobs and Flowertown was officially on the map. We spent the next 12-14 months building our brand, our platform and navigating this early stage industry that was littered with inexperience and constantly changing regulations, creating industry pause and uncertainty. Which brings us to June of 2019, where we closed a seed round with CohnReznick. This was a massive milestone for Flowertown. A 100 year old very conservative accounting firm made their first investment and it was in Flowertown. This was the beginning of a strategic partnership that would lead to several explorations in the cannabis industry.</p>
      <p>Flowertown is a vertically integrated media and marketing company offering the cannabis industry a suite of tools designed to aid in the consumers path to purchase. The Flowertown ecosystem has been developed to service the new consumer's needs from story to brand pages to product recommendations through trusted retail solutions. We specialize in content marketing, event and media activations, and in building messaging solutions that resonate on a national as well as local or regional level. Flowertown's local marketing expertise is unique to the industry. VIMBY is still a large content studio in Burbank California and Flowertown is located in Playa Vista California. While each team operates independently of one another, there will be some collaboration when it comes to local market executions. Aside from Flowertown’s well thought out platform that caters to curating experiences for new consumers, one of our biggest tools for the cannabis industry will be our local storytelling machine.</p>

      <p><b>Warren Bobrow=WB:</b> <b><u>Who are your mentors? Who inspired you to get into cannabis?</u></b></p>
      <p>Dean Waters=DW: One of my first mentors is a gentlemen named David Bienstock who owns the media buying service, Target Enterprises. I continually run things by David and remain close friends. Secondly, I learned a lot from Mark Burnett over my 6-7 year partnership. I’m looking forward to my new relationship with CohnReznick and working closely with Ira Weinstein who oversees the cannabis division. I entered the cannabis space because I truly feel like I can make a difference on a variety of levels, from getting medical stories into the hands of people that can truly benefit to showing people a healthier lifestyle though recreational use and taking my decades of marketing experience and helping retailers and brands maximize their potential.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>WB:What are your 6 and twelve month goals for Flowertown? What obstacles do you face?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>DW: Our six month goal is to start the localization versioning of <a href="https://flowertown.com/"><b>Flowertown.com </b></a>(e.g., Flowertown Chicago, Flowertown Detroit, etc.) and make the platform a must for consumer education and recommendations in every recreational and medical market. The twelve month goal is to continue our momentum as the trusted platform for consumers, continue to educate through developing consumer events and leverage our media and marketing expertise through large multi-state operator engagements. Our obstacles are time (it’s a marathon) and managing opportunity costs but building the platform the consumer market truly needs.  </p>
