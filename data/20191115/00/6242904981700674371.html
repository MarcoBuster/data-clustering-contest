        <b>The Black Meteors picked a ticket to the semifinal of the ongoing U23 Africa Cup of Nations after beating Mali 2-0 on Thursday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Coach Ibrahim Tanko’s men needed to overcome their West African counterparts to qualify for the seminal round after failing to record victory in their first two games.</p>
      <p>Despite struggling to dominate their opponents, Ghana managed to grab the group’s second qualifying ticket following a late brace from substitute forward Kwabena Owusu to win the game 2-0.</p>
      <p>Before Thursday’s match, Ghana were sitting on 3rd spot with just a point behind Egypt and Cameroon who had 6 and 4 points respectively.</p>
      <p>However, a 2-1 defeat against Egypt changed the dynamics of the group standings.</p>
      <p>Cameroon were outclassed by the young Pharaohs — who went into the game already qualified after Monday’s 3-2 win against Ghana.</p>
