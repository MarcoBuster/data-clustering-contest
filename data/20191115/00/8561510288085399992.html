      <h1>New Research: Astronauts Are Experiencing Cognitive Decline</h1>

      <h3>Galaxy Brain</h3>
      <p>A preliminary study suggests that a zero-gravity environment causes structural changes to the human brain — and that extended stays in space could lead to cognitive decline.</p>
      <p>Brain scans of astronauts revealed structural changes, likely caused by the time spent in microgravity, and correlated them to signs of cognitive impairment, <a href="https://www.space.com/spaceflight-changes-astronaut-brain-structure-function.html">according to <i>Space.com</i></a>. It’s just the latest in a long list of <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-research-astronauts-clots-bizarre-blood-flow">troubling</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/medical-experiments-space-aging-earth">medical</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-astronauts-brains-liquid">conditions</a> seemingly caused by spaceflight — and which scientists will need to sort out before long-term space travel or off-world settlements become feasible.</p>
      <h3>First Look</h3>
      <p>The research, <a href="http://www.ajnr.org/content/ajnr/early/2019/10/17/ajnr.A6249.full.pdf">published last month</a> in the <i>American Journal of Radiology</i>, only looked at a small number of astronauts, so the NASA and Medical University of South Carolina scientists behind it cautioned against putting too much weight in its findings until they can conduct a more robust experiment.</p>
      <p>But for now, the team noticed that an extended stay in space correlated with physical changes to the brain, which in turn seemed to be linked to a drop in performance in cognitive and motor tests.</p>
      <h3>Upper Limit</h3>
      <p>The changes were spotted in astronauts who spent a long period of time on the International Space Station, but not those who only spent a brief amount of time in orbit on a shuttle.</p>
      <p>“Not a lot is known about cognitive impairment in humans during spaceflight,” lead author Donna Roberts, a radiologist at South Carolina, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/muos-suc102819.php">said in a press release</a>. “Although this study evaluates a small subset of astronauts, it’s significantly larger than any previously published study of its kind involving astronauts or Russian cosmonauts.”</p>
