      <p>If you’re a serious or budding photographer who wants to get a little more out of your shots than your phone can offer, then eBay may well be the place to turn. The online retailer offers a ton of deals on some of today’s most popular — and sought-after — digital cameras. Indeed, whether you prefer Sony, Nikon, or Canon, the following shooters will not only deliver the best-looking pictures on the market but also come with some of the best deals around.</p>
      <p>So, if you’re ready to buy a new digital camera and want to get a shooter on the cheap, read on.</p>
      <h3>Sony Alpha a6400</h3>

      <p>Sony’s mirrorless cameras have become increasingly popular over the last few years, and the A6400 is a perfect example of why. The camera is capable of capturing stunning photos and videos, thanks to the 24.4-megapixel sensor.</p>
      <p>The Sony Alpha a6400 is capable of shooting up to 4K video, or 1,080p video at an impressive 120 frames per second. It’s relatively portable and compact too, which is good news for photographers on the go and isn’t overly expensive — thanks to the fact that it’s now $989.99 — or around $310 off its normal price. This deal comes with a 16-50mm lens too — so you won’t need to buy one separately. </p>

      <p>Over the years, the digital-SLR camera has revolved around mirrors and using them to create the picture you want. But Sony’s Alpha a7R III is a mirrorless digital camera that promises a truly unique photo-taking experience.</p>
      <p>The Sony shooter comes with a 42-megapixel sensor and is capable of shooting video in 4K. And since it comes with a tilting 3-inch touchscreen on the back, it’s easy to work your way around its built-in software to adjust settings or look at the pictures you’ve taken.</p>
      <p>Aside from that, the camera comes with built-in Wi-Fi support and a USB Type-C port. However, the deal on eBay is body-only, so if you need a lens, you’ll have to buy that separately.</p>
      <p>The Sony Alpha a7R III is available now for $1,609.99, a 51 percent savings off its regular retail price of $3,299.99.</p>

      <p>If you want one of the digital camera market’s best and most popular options and you don’t mind spending serious cash to get it, consider eBay’s offer on the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV.</p>
      <p>The camera is downright impressive, with a 30.4-megapixel sensor and a 3.2-inch touchscreen on the back that helps you interact with its settings and view pictures as you snap them. It’s capable of connecting to the Web via Wi-Fi and comes with GPS tracking, so you can automatically tag where you’re taking photos. And with an ISO range that can be expanded to 102,400, you’ll be impressed by its performance.</p>
      <p>Canon’s ESO 5D Mark IV typically costs $3,299 for just the body and no lenses. But if you act quickly, you can get it now at eBay for $2,046.88.</p>

      <p>Similar to the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, the Nikon D850 is an ultra-high-end camera that could give you some sticker shock. But at least eBay’s deal on it will make it a bit easier to swallow.</p>
      <p>The D850 comes with a 45.7-megapixel sensor and the ability to record video in 4K Ultra HD. Its native ISO ranges to 25,600, but you can extend it to a whopping 20,400. Better yet, it includes an 8K time-lapse feature for creating truly special videos.</p>
      <p>On the back, you’ll find a 3.2-inch touchscreen LCD for interacting with your pictures and the device’s built-in software. And with help from Nikon’s SnapBridge, you can sync content to the cloud.</p>
      <p>Nikon’s camera regularly retails for $4,600, but you can buy it now on eBay for $2,334.95.</p>
