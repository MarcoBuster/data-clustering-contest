      <h1>Finally Your Air Drumming Has An Outlet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/dammitcoetzee/" target="_blank">Gerrit Coetzee</a></address>
      <p>Two engineering students are<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/165577-the-airdrum-make-music-while-moving"> hard at work on this air drum</a> which they hope will help disabled people and people in nursing homes. Though, we think it just looks fun!</p>
      <p>Each board is its own module consisting of the electronics and 3D printed cases. The modules each contain an <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/01/24/finally-a-modern-theremin/">arduino</a> mini, IR sensor, and LEDs. They share power, audio, and communicate with an i2c bus. Two modules are special, one holds the power system and the other a Raspberry Pi. The units can be put together in different configurations. Finally, they are capped with speaker units.</p>
      <p>The demo shown in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hGOJ4dZPRM">video</a>, which you can see after the break, looks fun. The response time is pretty fast and it looks like you can measure all sorts of parameters. This can then be translated into different velocities, pitches, and instruments. It’s somewhere between a theremin and a drum kit, very cool.</p>
