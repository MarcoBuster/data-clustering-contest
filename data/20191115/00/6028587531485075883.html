      <p>In Part 1 and Part 2 of our exclusive interview series with Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, we covered a number of things including his recollections of US Airways Flight 1549, which he dramatically had landed on the Hudson River a decade ago, space tourism, the Boeing 737 Max, his father’s depression and more. Here, Sullenberger discusses his military flight training, what the passengers he saved most often say to him today and how to land an A320 on water.<b>Jim Clash: </b>How has your Air Force training helped you as a civilian pilot?</p>
      <p><b>Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger:</b> I think in many ways. Not that the military training of aviators is always better than that of civilian aviators, but it has certain advantages. First, military flight training, especially in advanced nations like the United States, is among the most rigorous, demanding and disciplined endeavors that exist. You have greater confidence that a military-trained aviator has been vetted multiple times, that only the people able to do it are allowed to do it, that they have the aptitude, the temperament and the discipline. The military process makes you more that way. We go through a very rigorous screening and training, and are taught to approach flying with a very professional attitude with a full and accurate appreciation of the risks, and of the need for effective leadership. And with a sense of obligation, diligence and a deep understanding that in safety-critical domains like aviation, just good enough isn’t enough. It instills in us a pilot ethos: continuous learning and striving for excellence, always trying to make the next flight better than the previous one.</p>
      <p>You have greater confidence with a military-trained aviator that there are no major gaps in knowledge. You know that they’ve flown high-performance jet aircraft, not just propeller airplanes. The flight characteristics between the two are very different. You have greater confidence that military pilots have not just been taught about low-altitude flying but also high-altitude meteorology and high-altitude aerodynamics, very different from flight at lower altitudes. They’ve also been taught physiology about the changes in the human body as we go higher. You know that all of the squares are filled, that they’ve been tested in important ways and have had to prove themselves not only knowledgeable and skillful, but worthy of trust. Those are huge advantages.</p>
      <p><b>Clash: </b>What do the passengers of Flight 1549 most often say when you meet them today?</p>
      <p><b>Sullenberger:</b> They still say thank you. And, as you can probably imagine, having gone through such a traumatic event together we have become very close. My father served in the Navy in WWII, and while he didn’t see combat, he knew many who did. From him I learned that warship crews held annual reunions for many years afterward. Our experience is somewhat analogous to that. Of course, we just had our 10-year reunion last January 15, in Charlotte at the museum where the airplane is. We gathered the passengers and crew together to celebrate the successful outcome that so many people contributed to. It’s been a wonderful fellowship that we’ve had.</p>
      <p><b>Clash:</b> Technically, how does one land an Airbus A320 on the water?</p>
      <p><b>Sullenberger:</b> Without engine thrust to make a more gradual approach to the runway at a lower descent rate, without being able to add or decrease thrust to maintain and remain on a proper flight path, one has to use gravity to provide the forward motion of the airplane to glide downhill. That, of course, results in a greater rate of descent. On that famous flight, I knew when we lost thrust 2,800 feet over Manhattan, one of the most densely developed and populated areas on the planet, that it was a matter of mere minutes before our flight path intersected the surface of the Earth. I just had to find the best way and the best place for that to happen.</p>
      <p>It’s a matter of setting clear priorities, taking remedial steps to solve whatever problems you can to regain thrust, if you can, and prepare for landing. Then you must choose the best surface to avoid obstacles to allow for a landing that does not do more damage to the aircraft and cause a post-crash fire or cause passengers or crew to be injured. You also have to choose the proper height to begin raising the nose and exercising the only control that you have over the vertical flight path by trading some of the forward speed for a reduced rate of descent and to touch down with a slightly nose-up attitude. That has to be done very precisely. Misjudging the proper height to begin the landing by might have caused us to land too hard and not in the proper attitude.</p>
      <p>You must simultaneously keep the wings exactly level, and start the landing neither too high nor too low. We know from the Digital Flight Data Recorder that I began raising the nose at 100 feet above the river, higher than for a normal landing because we were coming down so rapidly. We were able to do it successfully largely because of the assistance of our first officer, Jeff Skiles. Without me having to tell him, he knew that to try to judge that height was difficult, looking at the featureless water ahead where depth perception is inherently difficult, and, at that point, he began calling out air speed and altitude, to help me judge the height. As soon as we landed, our flight attendants, Donna Dent, Doreen Welsh and Sheila Dail began to evacuate the passengers, and New York Waterway ferries headed toward us for the rescue.</p>
