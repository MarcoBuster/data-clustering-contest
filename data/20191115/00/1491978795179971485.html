      <p>Labour’s plans to increase the minimum wage to £10 an hour for all workers on its first day in office will treble the number of people covered by the pay policy and largely miss the target of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/12/mcdonnell-takes-on-mcdonalds-over-tax-and-workers-pay">raising the incomes of poor households</a>, according to a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p>
      <p>The tax and spending watchdog said a Tory proposal to increase wages at a slower pace would only double the number of people protected by the minimum wage by 2024 and also largely benefit those in better-off households.</p>
      <p>In a scathing review of the parties’ proposals to reduce in-work poverty, the IFS said less than one in five of the people who would benefit from a higher minimum wage lived in low-income households. “The direct benefits from minimum wage increases would mostly go to middle-income households,” the report says.</p>
      <p>Only 17% of minimum-wage workers live in the poorest fifth of households and just 19% are in households in relative income poverty, after a shift to part-time work that often means low-paid workers live with higher earners, it says.</p>
      <p>Those workers who are on the minimum wage and live in the poorest households would lose much of the gains under Tory and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> plans without reforms to universal credit making it more generous.</p>
      <p>“Many of those who do live in low-income households would see part of their gains clawed back through reduced benefit entitlements,” the report says.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/30/conservatives-pledge-raise-national-living-wage-by-2024">Sajid Javid has </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/30/conservatives-pledge-raise-national-living-wage-by-2024">proposed to increase the national living wage</a>, which covers workers aged 25 and over, from £8.21 to £10.50, raising the low-pay floor from 60% to two-thirds of median earnings. Javid said the living wage would be extended to 21-year-olds over the duration of the parliament.</p>
      <p>The IFS said this would bring one in six employees within its scope, adding 2.5 million to the current 1.9 million covered by the living wage.</p>
      <p>Labour’s plans to introduce a £10 minimum for those aged 16 and over would mean more than a quarter of all employees’ wages being directly set by the minimum, with an additional 4.6 million employees aged 21 and over directly affected, taking the total to 6.5 million.</p>
      <p>Private sector workers would be more affected by Labour’s policy, which would mean almost 30% of private sector employees’ wages being set directly from Whitehall, while Conservative policy would set 20% of private sector wages.</p>
      <p>Xiaowei Xu, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report, said: “The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a> and Labour’s plans would take us into uncharted waters. That calls for a careful and incremental process to ensure that, if the employment prospects of the low-paid do start to be impacted, policymakers can change course before it is too late.</p>
      <p>“We should not be setting minimum wages via a political bidding war. If due consideration is not given to the balancing act involved, the risks to the very people the policy is intended to help may be quite severe.”</p>
