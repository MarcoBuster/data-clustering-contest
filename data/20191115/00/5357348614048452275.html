        <b>SAVANNA-LA-MAR, Westmoreland — Seventeen people were taken into custody in connection with various crimes committed in and around the Savanna-la-Mar area during a massive joint police/military operation yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to head of the Westmoreland Police Division, Superintendent Robert Gordon, some “key persons” are among the detainees to be questioned by the police.</p>
      <p>The senior police officer revealed that scores of people were searched during the operation, which commenced at 11:00 am and lasted for about four hours.</p>
      <p>“The police would have searched over 399 persons. We searched 40 premises and 125 motor vehicles,” Superintendent Gordon disclosed.</p>
      <p>No firearms were seized in the operation but, according to the superintendent of police, a number of offensive weapons were seized.</p>
      <p>He argued that yesterday's operation is part of an ongoing drive by the Westmoreland police to clamp down on illegal activities in the parish.</p>
      <p>“It's a part of our ongoing policing thrust within the general Westmoreland area to contain and to ensure that law-abiding citizens can go about their lawful business and conduct their business without fear of being harassed or victimised by criminals,” Superintendent Gordon noted.</p>
      <p>Westmoreland is one of the three western parishes now under states of public emergency. St James and Hanover are the other two parishes.</p>
