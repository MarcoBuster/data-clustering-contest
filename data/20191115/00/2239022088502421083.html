      <p>An unidentified suspect targeted two Rembrandt paintings in an attempted theft at London’s Dulwich Picture Gallery on Wednesday night, reports <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/14/police-foil-plan-to-steal-rembrandt-paintings-from-art-gallery"><i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The police said the intruder forced their way into the “Rembrandt’s Light” exhibition galleries half an hour to midnight on November 13. A new state-of-the-art alarm system installed for the exhibition notified security, reports <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/theft-rembrandt-dulwich-gallery-1703919">Artnet</a>, and the authorities arrived quickly to the scene. The suspect sprayed a canister of an unknown substance into an officer’s face and was able to get away, though no one suffered serious injuries and both canvases—which the gallery has declined to identify publicly—were secured on the grounds.</p>
      <p>Police officer <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Jason%20Barber">Jason Barber</a> called it an “audacious attempted burglary . . . [that] was clearly planned in advance.” The exhibition of thirty-five paintings, drawings, and etchings, including works on loan from the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum, is celebrating the 350th anniversary of the Dutch old master’s death and involves major works such as <i>Girl at a Window</i>, 1645; <i>A Woman Bathing in a Stream</i>, 1654; <i>Christ and St Mary Magdalen at the Tomb</i>, 1638; and <i>Philemon and Baucis</i>, 1658. The show, which opened last month and is scheduled to end in February, will remain closed until the police complete a full investigation of the foiled heist.</p>
