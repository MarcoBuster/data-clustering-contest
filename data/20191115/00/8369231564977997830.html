      <h1>A Terminally Ill British Scientist Aims to Be The Most 'Cybernetic' Human Ever Created</h1>

      <p>British roboticist Peter Scott-Morgan doesn't want you to see him as a man who died from a neurodegenerative disease. He wants to become Peter 2.0 – the most advanced cyborg ever.</p>
      <p>There's an extensive list of medical devices already helping him breathe, feed, and communicate; those technologies are set to grow in the near future. But, according to Scott-Morgan, this isn't about staving off death; it's about evolving.</p>
      <p>"Yes, I know, this all sounds like science fiction," <a href="http://www.scott-morgan.com/blog/next-generation-think-tank/becoming-peter-2-0/peter-2-0-the-present/">he admits on his blog</a>.</p>
      <p>"But some of the top brains in the world, in an alliance of some of the most powerful hi-tech megacorporations, are set to make it happen – by the end of this year."</p>
      <p>The timeline more or less coincides with the amount of time Scott-Morgan has left. Statistically speaking, at least. But he has every intention of seeing what 2020 has in store, and more.</p>
      <p>His biological body is declining from a terminal condition that slowly destroys the nerves, called <a href="https://www.neura.edu.au/health/motor-neurone-disease/">motor neurone disease</a>. It's the same neurodegenerative disorder the physicist Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with in 1963, leaving him relying on technology for mobility <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stephen-hawking-s-new-speech-system-will-be-open-source">and speech</a>.</p>
      <p>Like Hawking's, Scott-Morgan's nervous system is slowly losing its ability to govern key functions and voluntary movements, leaving him in a state of all-but-complete paralysis.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the 61-year-old man returned home after nearly a month in intensive care recovering from a number of life-saving – or, as he sees it, enhancing – procedures.</p>
      <p>Those include a mini-ventilator (quieter than Darth Vader's, <a href="https://twitter.com/DrScottMorgan/status/1193923007045132289">he boasts cheerfully</a>), as well as a feeding tube into his stomach and a colostomy bag. Scott-Morgan has also had his voice box removed to reduce the risk of aspirating his saliva, and communicates with synthetic speech.</p>
      <p>Every new piece of engineering is being viewed "an upgrade" rather than a substitute. But the best is apparently yet to come.</p>
      <p>"We are now only a year or two away from being able to pull off something revolutionary. All the technology pretty well already exists in isolation," <a href="http://www.scott-morgan.com/blog/next-generation-think-tank/becoming-peter-2-0/peter-2-0-the-future/">he says</a>.</p>
      <p>This includes tech innovations such as <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/elon-musk-says-an-update-on-his-brain-computer-interface-is-coming-soon">brain-computer interfaces</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-this-new-robot-lets-you-paint-using-just-your-eyes">eye tracking</a> that are still on the horizon. But Scott-Morgan envisions more than that – he sees a future where Peter 2.0 isn't so much a body in physical space, but a mind in a digital landscape.</p>
      <p>"Peter 2.0 can only do it because he's a lot more than just a biological body remotely controlling two doppelgangers," <a href="http://www.scott-morgan.com/blog/next-generation-think-tank/thought-experiment/">he explains</a>.</p>
      <p>Together with his husband Francis, Scott-Morgan has set up a foundation that aims to research ethical use of AI and robotics to augment anybody who feels restricted by illness, age, or disability.</p>
      <p>The future is already here, in many ways. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson">But to quote</a> the science fiction writer William Gibson, "it's just not very evenly distributed".</p>
      <p>To widen access to life-saving treatments and technologies for people with motor neurone disease, their '<a href="http://www.scott-morgan.com/blog/right-to-thrive/message-from-peter/">Right to Thrive</a>' campaign has been calling on members of parliament for support.</p>
      <p>Fundamentally, the campaign's message is less about building futuristic cyborgs or living in a digital utopia. Those images might grab our attention, but it's a depressing reality that we need to appeal to the imagination at all.</p>
      <p>Because Peter 2.0 is really about something more.</p>
      <p>"At its core, the RIGHT TO THRIVE is about fair access, genuine choice, and healthcare equality," <a href="http://www.scott-morgan.com/blog/right-to-thrive/message-from-peter/">he writes</a>.</p>
      <p>Maybe we'll be hearing from Peter 2.0 for some time yet. We hope so.</p>
      <p>But even if critical technology doesn't arrive in time for Scott-Morgan, the roboticist's message of transformation is still an important one. It's just the rest of society that could do with a little evolving when it comes to chronic illness and disability.</p>
