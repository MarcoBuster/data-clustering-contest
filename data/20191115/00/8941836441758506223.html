      <p>BOSTON (AP) - The former president of a private tennis club in Texas is expected to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/martin-fox/">Martin Fox</a> is scheduled to appear in Boston’s federal court Friday. The 62-year-old from Houston previously agreed to plead guilty to a racketeering conspiracy charge in a deal with prosecutors.</p>
      <p>Authorities say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/martin-fox/">Fox</a> brokered bribes to help wealthy parents rig their children’s college entrance exams. He’s also accused of arranging bribes to get two students admitted to the University of San Diego as recruited athletes, and one to the University of Texas.</p>
