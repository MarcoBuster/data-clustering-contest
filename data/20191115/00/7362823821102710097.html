      <p>The live, squirming fish can be seen lying all over the street during the chaotic scene, as pedestrians grabbed as many of them as they could.</p>
      <p>“Not a loot. Disaster management workers rescuing the victims!” a Twitter user commented.</p>
      <p>“It seems that today a dish of fish will be made in Kapur,” another person tweeted.</p>
