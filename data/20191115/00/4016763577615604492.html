      <h1>Taylor Swift’s Conflict With Scooter Braun &amp; Big Machine Records Escalates Amidst Licensing &amp; Royalties Disputes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Mench</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a>’s business <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-on-scooter-braun-acquiring-her-back-catalog-this-is-my-worst-case-scenario">drama with Scooter Braun and Big Machine Records</a> continues to snowball, and she’s asking fans for help. In a lengthy note posted to her social media on Thursday night, Swift claimed that Braun and Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta have denied her the right to perform any of her old songs at the upcoming American Music Awards, where she will be <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-will-be-named-artist-of-the-decade-at-the-2019-american-music-awards">honored as the Artist of the Decade</a> and was set to perform a medley of her old hits.</p>
      <p>She further stated that she likely won’t be able to perform any of her pre-<i>Lover</i> material at any recorded event until her contract expires next November. Even a planned Netflix documentary, which she revealed in the note, will be put on hold because Braun and Borchetta have allegedly denied her request to use her old music and video footage:</p>

      <p>Swift ends the note by urging fans to encourage other artists that Braun manages to take up her cause. Braun works closely with superstars like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Demi-lovato">Demi Lovato</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/J-balvin">J Balvin</a>.</p>
      <p>Big Machine Label Group later fired back with a statement of its own. In its note, the label claims that Swift owes “millions of dollars” to the company and says they aren’t blocking her from performing at the AMAs. The statement does not, however, address Swift’s specific claim that the label won’t allow her to perform her older material or license her older music for her Netflix documentary:</p>
      <blockquote>As Taylor Swift’s partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information. At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor’s decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.<br/>The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career. We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward. We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families.<br/>Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side. To date, not one of the invitations to speak with us and work through this has been accepted. Rumors fester in the absence of communication. Let’s not have that continue here. We share the collective goal of giving your fans the entertainment they both want and deserve.</blockquote>
      <p>A rep for Swift provided an <a href="https://twitter.com/joecoscarelli/status/1195359447067103236/photo/3">email to <i>The New York Times</i></a> from a Big Machine executive dated October 28, which says that the label “will not agree to issue licenses for existing recordings or waivers of its rerecording restrictions in connection with” her Netflix documentary. The rep also claimed that it’s Big Machine that owes Swift money, to the tune of “$7.9 million dollars [sic] of unpaid royalties over several years.”</p>
      <p>Even Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) weighed in by criticizing the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which provided financing to Braun’s Ithaca Holdings for the purchase of Big Machine Records and Swift’s catalog:</p>

      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) later added onto the criticism against private equity firms:</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Swift <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-on-scooter-braun-acquiring-her-back-catalog-this-is-my-worst-case-scenario">went public with her dissatisfaction about the fact that Braun’s company had purchased Big Machine Records</a>, and with it, the rights to the master recordings of her vast and lucrative back catalog of music. She has feuded with Braun for years and expressed how upset she was that he controlled her life’s work. Swift recently claimed that she <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-plans-to-re-record-her-old-songs-to-combat-scooter-braun-deal">plans to re-record her old music</a> once she is contractually allowed to do so in November 2020. <i>Lover</i> was her first album released outside Big Machine Records, and the first to which she controls her own masters.</p>
