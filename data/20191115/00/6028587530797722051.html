      <p><i>Punch back harder!</i>That is a mantra that seems more popular these days, especially with the rancor we witness daily on our politics. Doing so may provide immediate satisfaction, but its effects could be transitory because seldom does one punch do it. You must keep punching.</p>
      <p>There is another way that was illustrated by Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who appeared before a congressional committee investigating impeachment charges against Donald Trump. Yovanovitch had been the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until this past July when she was summarily sacked. Later it turned out that Trump had disparaged her to the president of Ukraine in a phone call, labeling her "bad news.” </p>
      <p>Yovanovitch admitted she had been frightened by such remarks. Still, in her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-opening-statement.html">prepared testimony</a> before the committee, she was an exemplar of composure, namely how to present your case professionally as well as personally. The ambassador, in essence, gave a master class in how to defend yourself without being defensive. Let’s dissect what she said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lessons to learn</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Tell a story.</i> Yovanovitch began with her life story, but doing so in a way that positioned herself as fortunate. “My service is an expression of gratitude for all that this country has given my family and me. My late parents did not have the good fortune to come of age in a free society. My father fled the Soviets before ultimately finding refuge in the United States. My mother's family escaped the USSR after the Bolshevik revolution, and she grew up stateless in Nazi Germany before eventually making her way to the United States. Their personal histories—my personal history—gave me both deep gratitude towards the United States and great empathy for others—like the Ukrainian people—who want to be free.”</p>
      <p><i>Make your case</i>. Yovanovitch explained why it was important that the U.S. stand up against corruption. “Corrupt leaders are inherently less trustworthy, while an honest and accountable Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukrainian partnership more reliable and more valuable to the United States. A level playing field in this strategically-located country bordering four NATO allies, creates an environment in which U.S. business can more easily trade, invest, and profit. Corruption is also a security issue because corrupt officials are vulnerable to Moscow. In short, it is in America's national security interest to help Ukraine transform into a country where the rule of law governs and corruption is held in check.”</p>
      <p><i>Address the elephant in the room. </i>Yovanovitch made it clear that she felt she was the scapegoat for standing in the way of those, both American and Ukrainian, who were profiting from corruption. At the end of a litany of what she had witnessed in Ukraine, she said: "What I can say is that Mr. [Rudy] Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”</p>
      <p><i>Close by citing the example of colleagues.</i> Yovanovitch closed with a praiseworthy defense of her colleagues in the Foreign Service. “As I close, let me be clear on who we are and how we serve this country. We are professionals, public servants who by vocation and training pursue the policies of the president, regardless of who holds that office or what party they affiliate with… And we make a difference every day. We are people who repeatedly uproot our lives, who risk— and sometimes give—our lives for this country.” The ambassador specifically noted Foreign Service officers who had died or had been imprisoned while serving overseas.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch followed up her prepared comments by taking questions from the committee. There too, she held her own, her demeanor always professional as well as respectful. The ambassador projected calmness that demonstrated her sense of inner resolve. This behavior was also evident in the questions she fielded from congresspeople.</p>
      <p>When we are wronged, we want to fight to clear our name, but sometimes the best way to present yourself is to argue your case with the facts, backed by your experience, and do so in a way that demonstrates you are in control. You may not win points immediately, but you will demonstrate that you have what it takes to stand up to criticism and do it with your integrity intact.</p>
      <p>The Apache leader, Geronimo, was quoted as saying, “I was no chief and never had been, but because I had been more deeply wronged than others, this honor was conferred upon me, and I resolved to prove worthy of the trust.” The same could be applied to Ambassador Yovanovitch.</p>
