        <b>Barcelona's hunt for a long-term centre-forward is of no concern to Luis Suarez.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Luis Suarez welcomed Barcelona's search for a <b>new striker</b> despite the threat it could bring to his starting spot.</p>
      <p>LaLiga leaders Barca have been linked to <b>Lautaro Martinez, Erling Haaland and Carlos Vela</b> as they seek to strengthen Ernesto Valverde's attacking options.</p>
      <p>The club failed to bring <b>Neymar back from Paris Saint-Germain</b> during the close season, leaving the squad light on competition for natural centre-forward Suarez.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old has scored six goals in eight LaLiga starts this season but knows he will not always be able to perform at the highest level.</p>
      <p>"There will come a time when my age will not allow me to live up to what Barcelona needs to compete," Suarez told Uruguayan publication Ovacion.</p>
      <p>"But as long as I can, as long as I have the strength, giving me competition is much better.</p>

      <p>"That they are looking for or want to bring another number nine is nothing strange, it is <b>the reality of football.</b></p>
      <p>"It will be better for me and better for the club, because it will feed competition, and it will be better for the future because the club can <b>prepare a player with the help of all the great players at Barcelona</b>."</p>
      <p>Suarez joined Barca from Liverpool in 2014 and is now in his <b>sixth season at Camp Nou.</b></p>
      <p>The former Ajax forward plans to continue his career until at least the 2022 World Cup, which would be his fourth appearance at the tournament.</p>
      <p>"I hope so," he said. <b>"I am really convinced of that, yes."</b></p>
      <p>Suarez is part of the Uruguay squad for the upcoming international friendlies against Hungary (November 15) and Argentina (November 18), his <b>first involvement with the national team</b> since the Copa America in June.</p>
