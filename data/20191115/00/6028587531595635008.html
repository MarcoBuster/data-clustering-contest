      <p><i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lowes-goes-diy-on-software-development-11569451699">reported</a> <i>Journal</i></p>
      <p>Lowe's' focus on creating highly personalized experiences is something I see many organizations concentrating on. The importance of technology today -- in particular, how it represents the key interaction point between a company and its customers -- means that simply using existing packaged software means you are providing a standard, underwhelming digital experience.</p>
      <p>Most businesses today are investing heavily in technology. The challenge, therefore, is how to stand out from the crowd and create a digital experience beyond that of the competition. And you can only build a differentiated product by taking more control, as Lowe’s has decided to do.</p>
      <p>Executives are looking to use state-of-the-art technology, from augmented reality to chatbots to machine learning, to create a customer experience that differentiates their business. But at the same time, they realize that they need to take a highly customized approach in order to meet the personal needs of their customers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Customization is only possible if you free up resources and budget.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lowe’s is taking a mature and sophisticated approach. According to the WSJ article, the company aims to build 80% of its application portfolio in-house to enable them to create more custom experiences for their customers. However, for standard internal business processes that provide no differentiation, they will continue to purchase packaged software.</p>
      <p>Today, the widespread availability of software development kits (SDKs), frameworks and open-source software means that building your own software products, while still highly complex, can be done faster than ever before. Lowe’s has recognized that building its own solution means it will be able to incorporate the latest technologies and methodologies into what it wants to be a competitive differentiator for its business.</p>
      <p>Of course, this strategy has its challenges and dangers. It’s one thing for a digitally native company to write their own software, but it’s a very different one for a traditional enterprise to be able to apply and practice the right methodologies as well as leverage the latest or best technical solutions to achieve their digital aspirations.</p>
      <p>This is where smart companies understand that building your own solution does not always mean going at it alone. Thus, they build strategic partnerships with consulting firms, software engineering companies and technology providers. These partnerships allow them to minimize risk and get to market sooner with better quality and potentially at a reduced cost, while still offering a differentiated experience to their customers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Start with a digital vision, and don't just focus on technology.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before following in the footsteps of Lowe’s, it’s worth taking a step back to see how such a strategy can be applied to your organization. It all starts with creating a digital vision. How can this vision help you achieve rapid growth and become a leader in your industry? As Charlene Li points out in her book <i>The Disruptive Mindset</i>, it's rarely technology alone that creates disruption and growth in an industry, but rather “the application of existing technologies in new ways that enable it." This has been the case for companies from Uber to Netflix.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Take the necessary steps to own your digital experience.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the digital world, your top executives need to own your digital experience. This means building software and applications designed to deliver a unique experience. While this involves taking more control, it may still be necessary to work with partners, from agile development specialists to cloud service providers.</p>
      <p>For example, in much the same way as what Lowe’s is doing, banks and financial services firms are learning that they can no longer manage and control the whole tech stack but need to take a more sophisticated approach to managing their technology environment in order to create compelling digital experiences for increasingly demanding customers.</p>
      <p>Remember, deciding to take more control and ownership doesn't necessarily mean you won't need to leverage some third-party technologies, components or software development companies that can help you realize your vision faster, with proven practices and technologies.</p>
