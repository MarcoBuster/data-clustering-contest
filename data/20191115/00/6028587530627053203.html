      <p>This is just my opinion but, the reason why some of the world’s most iconic (and I’ll just say it… beautiful) yachts are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billspringer/2019/10/08/exclusive-photos-of-207-footer-in-monaco-show-benetti-continues-to-build-superyachts-at-unprecedented-rate/#62a3e00532b6">designed and built in Italy</a> is simply because Italians value <i>beauty and design</i> above all else. Some say this is because Italians are literally immersed in beauty (architecture, art, fashion, yachts, cars etc.) their whole their lives. And I know I’m stating the obvious when I say that all superyacht shipyards and yacht designers—no matter what their location or nationality—share the same challenges, and love of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billspringer/2019/11/13/superyacht-owner-interview-car-loving-american-entrepreneur-herb-chambers-talks-about-owning-one-of-hottest-superyachts-in-the-world-the-263-foot-long-excellence/#257604552d5e">beauty and design</a>. But when saw that Italy’s <a href="https://www.rossinavi.it/en/homepage/">Rossinavi shipyard</a> and the well-known <a href="https://pininfarinai.it/">Pininfarina design house</a> have teamed up to <a href="https://pininfarina.rossinavi.it/">create a new 213-foot-long superyacht concept</a>, I had a feeling it might be something special. </p>

      <p>And as you can see in these renderings, the new Super Sport 65 combines an aggressive, yet elegant esthetic of a high-performance Italian sports car with luxurious interior and outdoor spaces that are infused with style that only legendary Italian designers can achieve. The yacht’s “Italian Style” is also evident in the way Pininfarina’s designers have connected the bow to the stern with a stunning, single line.</p>
      <p>Built entirely of aluminum, the Super Sport 65 is large enough to be extremely comfortable, yet its draft is shallow enough to allow for easy access to those hidden bays and smaller ports that similar sized yachts can’t enter. </p>

      <p>And anyone who’s familiar with the supercar Pininfarina designed for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2019/05/13/who-is-f1s-most-successful-team-boss/#1c98334859e6">F1 racing legend </a>and <a href="https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500/history/historical-stats/race-stats/summaries/indianapolis-500-race-winners">Indianapolis 500 winner</a> Emerson Fittipaldi will recognize how the Supersport 65 echoes the design, proportions and most of all the sexiness of the <a href="https://www.fittipaldimotors.com/">EF7 Vision Gran Turismo by Pininfarina</a> while still guaranteeing large spaces for outdoor entertainment featuring several lounge areas. </p>
      <p>In fact, it seems like the curved design of the main staircase could have been inspired by the air intakes of the EF7 too.</p>

      <p>“The only limit in the design of sports boat is the impact on the general floorplan,” says Federico Rossi, COO of Rossinavi. “For this reason, creating a nice balance between interior architecture and exterior design is always challenging. With Super Sport 65 we have overcome this limit. We enter a new design dimension with the lower deck’s layout to the large areas dedicated to the crew and to the captain’s cockpit and engine room. The elegant and spacious design of the common areas including the main saloon and a larger owner’s cabin at bow all the way to the salon of the upper deck are the result of this new design direction which culminates in the flying bridge with Pininfarina’s signature super car design.” </p>

      <p>“Pininfarina and Rossinavi speak the same language and share the same passion and values,” explains Paolo Pininfarina, Chairman of the Pininfarina Group. “Leveraging on this common background and vision, Pininfarina is in the best position to express its creativity. Taking inspiration from our sports cars and translating their sleek and fast lines into the design of a super yacht is the pure synthesis of elegance and sportiness.”</p>
      <p>Even the description of this new concept is sexy, right? And you know what? I bet it’s even sexier in Italian.</p>
