      <p>In 2012, a much-needed annual wine event was launched by the New York–based importer <a href="https://www.winebow.com/">Winebow</a>. In October of 2019, the <a href="https://www.womenwineleaders.com/">Women in Wine Leadership Symposium</a> — which gives affiliated women producers, trade and communicators, seasoned and newcomers, chances to talk to each other about wine and careers — met for the eighth time, long enough I thought for a first look back at what a few WWLS faces have seen happen across that time. First some recent numbers."By including experts from research organizations or career counselors in our programming each year we are able to frame our conversations in both quantitative and qualitative ways," symposium creator and Winebow’s vice president of public relations Marilyn Krieger wrote to me in an email. "We know that creating an inclusive environment is the right thing to do, but it’s even more empowering to learn about research that shows how a diverse work environment benefits business." At this year's Symposium, economist <a href="https://iwpr.org/people/jessica-milli-ph-d/">Jessica Milli, Ph.D.</a>, study director at the <a href="https://iwpr.org/">Institute for Women’s Policy Research</a> presented some grounding numbers. Women, in the most generalized sense, make up almost half of the workforce in the United States, and earn the majority of college degrees each year at every level, Milli noted (<a href="https://statusofwomendata.org/publications/2015-national-report/">The Status of Women in the States: 2015</a>). Together, we earn an average of 82 cents for every dollar that men earn for full-time year-round work (<a href="https://iwpr.org/publications/annual-gender-wage-gap-2018/">The Gender Wage Gap: 2018; Earnings Differences by Gender, Race, and Ethnicity</a>). Refine those numbers by race and ethnicity and: black women earn 62 cents for every dollar that white men earn while Latina women earn 55 cents.</p>
      <p>According to Milli's presentation, in the U.S. women (overall, again) are more likely than men to work in managerial and professional occupations, but once there we are kept in mid-level management positions. <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-sp-500-companies/">Only 5%</a> of all Fortune 500 CEO’s are women. More and more of us are starting our own businesses. Over the past decade, 2007 to 2018, the number of women-owned businesses grew by 58% compared with overall business growth of 12% — this includes the number of businesses owned by women of color which grew at nearly three times that rate: 163% (<a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/files/doc_library/file/2018-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf">The 2018 State of Women-Owned Businesses Report</a>). But, we struggle to access capital needed to start and grow — the average revenue of a woman-owned business is less than a quarter of the average revenue of a business owned by a man — and as a result our businesses earn less and are more likely to fail.</p>
      <p>A 2018 survey of professional women, from Milli's report and again generalized, found that 64% of us have experienced microaggressions at work. As examples: 27% of us have had our judgement questioned in our area of expertise, 31% felt we needed to provide more evidence of our competence than was required of others, and 20% of us had been mistaken for someone at a much lower level. The numbers are higher when we look at the numbers for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briannegarrett/2019/11/06/how-black-women-in-wineand-their-alliesare-banding-together-to-achieve-better-representation/#27b3697f140a">black women</a> only — 40%, 42% and 22%, respectively (<a href="https://wiw-report.s3.amazonaws.com/Women_in_the_Workplace_2018.pdf">Women in the Workplace: 2018</a>). To the economic fixes needed, add the work that needs to be done to end some very real work dangers: the conversation (see below) I had with 2019 symposium panelist, wine writer and consultant <a href="https://www.juliaconey.com/">Julia Coney</a> on the need for a #metoo response in the wine industry took place just days before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/dining/drinks/anthony-cailan-sexual-assault.html">this New York Times story</a> was published.</p>
      <p>In light of all of the above, I talked to three women associated with the 2019 symposium and asked them to share what the world of women in wine looks like from where they stand, with an eye on the past eight years. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/jobs/michelle-defeo-of-laurent-perrier-a-toast-to-france-in-a-queens-loft.html">Michelle Defeo</a>, US President of <a href="https://www.laurent-perrier.com/en/">Laurent-Perrier</a>, who launched the <a href="https://wineindustryadvisor.com/2019/04/18/champagne-laurent-perrier-winebow-announce-women-in-wine-leadership-scholarship">Champagne Laurent Perrier Women in Wine Leadership Scholarship</a> in partnership with Winebow and <a href="https://www.sommfoundation.com/">SommFoundation</a> earlier this year (its first three recipients were announced at this year's symposium). Coney, who shared the personal side to her work on the intersection of race, wine and language, and told me about what perfume and wine have in common. Krieger with a firsthand view on what the event’s attendees have asked for over the years and what life is like for the women whose wines the company imports. (Turns out, some basic components of being a woman in wine are the <i>Somm</i> films, natural perfume, and, crucially, speaking up.)</p>
      <p>Here, Defeo, Coney and Krieger talk about what they've seen from their unique places in the U.S. wine industry.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wine as credentials</b>
      </p>
      <p>After 23 years in the business, DeFeo sees working conditions for women in wine getting better faster in more recent times: "There's still a long way to go, but the trajectory is getting stronger and stronger," she told me by phone. With the emergence of events like the WWLS and <a href="https://www.batonnageforum.com/">Battonage</a>, "we're seeing that more women are communicating more with each other. And there are more role models at higher levels in the industry than ever before." It's a necessary start: according to Milli’s report, a 2017 study found that only 54% of women have access to senior leaders who act as mentors or informal sponsors in their careers. Traditionally women filled wine's marketing and PR ranks, "and then sales more and more," Defeo told me. "Now I'm starting to see some women in powerful positions in distributers and that's such a critical part of our business. It's still very very male-dominated but it's changing."</p>
      <p>Certifications have played a big part. Defeo has seen a sharp increase in women pursing credentials, from both the on-premise-oriented Court of Master Sommeliers and the wine-business-minded Wine and Spirits Education Trust, traceable to "the impact of the movie <i>Somm</i>," she points out. "I think that <i>sommelier</i> went from being a word that only people in the industry or a very small subset of consumers knew to something that everybody knows." To better understand what the candidates for her scholarship were doing, this September Defeo sat a Court exam, and became a certified sommelier. Preparing for the exam offered lessons of many kinds: when she posted a tutoring request on the industry networking and info site <a href="https://www.guildsomm.com/">GuildSomm</a>, about 10 people responded, including one women. While the majority of the men dismissed her request, writing to tell her she could do it on your own, "the woman offered to help and I hired her and she was tough and supportive, and I passed. There's actually no way I could have learned the things that I learned without her teaching me."</p>
      <p>Fortunately that gatekeeping isn’t entirely working. "We've seen consumption trends of wine by women growing along with the idea of living your best life and following your passion, so lots more people want to get into the wine business," Defeo says. This set a new challenge for the U.S. wine-selling industry: finding the capable ones in the new crowd of candidates. "The industry needed more credentials," Defeo says. "It shows you're serious about learning more than just the basic level, that there's a level of dedication that is very serious. Anyone can learn their own product to sell, and I think that's largely what had happened in the past, but now people are really committed to the industry." Salespeople must now sell to buyers who themselves are knowledgeable and dedicated to the industry, and this been an unlikely opportunity for women entering the industry: "There are so many certified sommeliers who are in buying positions, and advanced sommeliers," she says. "The MS have always been such a rarified group and having to sell to them was terrifying but there were only a few of them in your market. Now our sales team are going out and talking to buyers who are extraordinarily knowledgeable. I think it's a wonderful shift for women because while it's that classic example of how women have to prove themselves more than men do, no one can not be taken seriously if they have undergone that certification — they've earned that pin."</p>
      <p>A flashback to earlier days, and then a turning point. "I've realized that just because I wasn't concerned about me being a woman in male-dominated industry, didn't mean that the men weren't very aware of the fact," Defeo says of her two decades in wine. It took being in a "very aggressive meeting" with 11 men at a previous workplace, for another women in the office to point out that Defeo had been the only woman in the room. "I thought, Hey doesn't that make me cool, and then I investigated that a little bit more and realized that just because I wasn't aware of it doesn't mean that they weren't. I was really pretty naive, I went to an all-women's undergrad program. I've seen women in powerful positions, the president of the wine importer was a women, then I looked around and opened my eyes. I didn't <i>like</i> being a novelty, but I didn't realize how much I'd suffered from it. That led me to say, Ok, I need to be active in developing women and how can I do that? That's one of the ways that the scholarship program came about."</p>
      <p>The final step to the <a href="https://www.sommfoundation.com/scholarship/champagne-laurent-perrier-women-in-wine-leadership-scholarship-enrichment-trip/">scholarship</a> was Defeo’s first WWLS in 2017, when Alexandra Pereyre de Nonancourt (Laurent-Perrier CEO and daughter of founder Bernard) presented the 2004 Laurent-Perrier Alexandra Cuvée Rosé. "It was such an eye-opening moment,” Defeo says. “Think globally, act locally: what can I do right here with this group that's already so well formed?" Her answer was to develop a mentoring program for women in distributer roles. “Because I do feel that women don't need to prove themselves as much if they have a third-party certification, I thought let's do this with the Court to make sure that at least there are three women out there who are going to get that pin so they can point to it when the male customer asks to see the sommelier."</p>
      <p>Partnering with the SommFoundation for the selection process (because the candidates work for licensees, neither DeFeo nor Winebow can select the winners — instead, they write the parameters for the Foundation to follow, including questions about candidates' history in the wine business, goals they wanted to achieve, how the scholarship would specifically help them), Defeo asked that there be one winner for each of the Court’s three levels. Winners would come to the conference, and mentoring sessions with Defeo would be held right after. On October 7, 2019, the inaugural recipients — <a href="https://ilikethisgrape.com/vino4-elli-benchimol/">Elli Benchimol</a> studying for her MS; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missyauge/">Missy Auge</a> after her AS; <a href="https://m.facebook.com/PackingHouseWines/posts/we-are-so-so-proud-of-our-very-own-rosa-gonzalez-for-receiving-the-2019-champagn/10156449283218549/">Rosa González</a> working on her CS — and Defeo "had a chance to meet and talk together then all go out as a group at the end of the day, and have our own mentoring network. I learn so much from talking to them about what their challenges are, what they're dealing with. It's a two-way street. There's a lot of openness and honesty from the outset with everyone, and I need to figure out how to expand that."</p>
      <p>Is there a plan to keep all the recipients as a community in and of itself? "Absolutely. I want to create this network and this community, so another organic support system for women can take place," Defeo says. "I'm so pleased at being able to help in a concrete way, finally. And it feels like the younger women, too, are on it. They are completely aware of their role as women in this business and fully intent on changing it. I think the industry is going to be changing quite dramatically, in only good ways. I was regaling them with stories about stuff that I endured that I thought I had to in order to be accepted in the industry 20 years ago, and they said, But that's illegal, but that's. . . . Yeah, well, we never should have tolerated it, and how great is it now that women can feel supported and strong enough to say, Ok, I'm not going to tolerate that."</p>
      <p>"I think there are things over all on a macro level that are making it easier, or, that's too strong of a word, making it less bad for women in the workplace,” Defeo says. “I hope it will keep going on that same positive trajectory."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wine as allyship, and perfume</b>
      </p>
      <p>For the past three and a half years Coney has been settling deeply into the wine industry, fresh from a beauty writing career in which a particular kind of, and as it turns out not-unrelated, love for perfumes made her crave a next step. "I saw beauty more like, if I wrote about a fragrance it was everything about where the flowers came from. The fragrance was almost secondary, it was more the ingredients," she told me by phone. "I like luxury fragrance and luxury skincare, so for me it was, What is behind this that makes me want it so much?" She had been to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/travel/grasse-france-perfume-fragrance-gardens-capital.html">Grasse</a> to study with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/fashion/meet-olivier-polge-chanels-new-fragrance-creator.html">Flowerbomb-creator Olivier Polge</a>, learned fragrance broken down into components. "It was like how we talk about wine. There's a flower — it's like a grape — and then this-side-of-the-hill jasmine smells different from that-side-of-the-hill jasmine, and Grasse is the home of all the flowers, and that's where really fragrance starts." Long a wine drinker — she'd been introduced to her current subject years earlier at a work cookout when the host poured Opus One and Clos du Val — she’d also been to many wine regions. She put it all together, and set out on her new work. But familiarity with wine lands and aroma components did little to prepare her for the people who were now her colleagues.</p>
      <p>"I thought wine was changing like the beauty industry had, where you have people understanding that change is happening and you can't put out a foundation unless you can say more colors are coming forth because that's what the consumer is looking for but also because that's the way the world looks, right?" she says. "Coming into wine, I expected racism, but the blatant racism to my face I did not expect. I thought, Here is a product you want to sell, and then I'm a person asking a question and you're making all these assumptions. Or I was being questioned, like 'You've been to Bordeaux?' I thought, I can't believe I'm having this conversation in 2016." The list goes on; a person she met after they'd talked on the phone and emailed greeted her with "I didn't expect you to be black." At a masterclass in a DC restaurant a fellow attendee sought her out to ask for directions to the restroom. "I said, Why would I know? And he said, Oh, you look like the help," Coney shared. "You could hear the gasps of the people who knew me, and the PR lady said to him, Why would you say that? But what if she wasn't in the room? And what happens when a person doesn't defend another person in the room?" On her way to tastings, along with preparing for navigating headaches like traffic there's the readying herself for other attendees: "I literally have to say, Who is going to be a jerk to me today? I just tell myself someone's going to say something, and I've never been proven wrong."</p>
      <p>How does this shape her communication about wine? "I try to separate it. If it's just about the wine then it's just about the wine. If I'm covering something where it's more about how remiss things are in the consumer market, then I need to bring that up. If it's about the relationship of consumers and why you're missing the mark, then yes, I will write about that." And if someone she's interested in has, say, social media pages that "never reflect someone who looks like me, I won't follow. Or I'll email whoever runs your social and tell them they need to put a person of color and specifically these are the races I'm speaking of, because I also have to identify that, and then explain why." Speaking up for people of color, she points out, includes reminding those publications and wineries that a "color that you care about is green, and you're missing a lot of green." But it hurts both ways: the lack of inclusion is "one of the reasons why you have younger people going to crappy self-serves. The wine industry doesn't make people feel welcome."</p>
      <p>Entering the industry as a second career, older and more experienced, Coney comes with "self-awareness and a confidence that I know what I know, but I still try to approach wine with a beginner's mind, that I'm never too old to learn," she says. "I always try to say, Ok, what don't I know, who can I learn from. But I don't come in as an older person dissing everybody younger than me. I see a lot of older people who may have burned out and they don't want to listen to anybody young, and I think that's part of the problem, too. I think mentorship is a two-way street. The whole purpose of it is to be poured into by both parties. I have a mentee and I tell her this all the time. I think for women, at this time that is crucial with so much of women's rights and ideas and ideologies being questioned on every forefront, the mentorship part needs to happen, and we also need to admit, like we said at the symposium, that there are a lot of toxic women, a lot of women who should not be in leadership but they are. I talk to a lot of younger black women who are coming up in the industry. They're going through things that other people did and they feel like they're the only one, and I tell them, Let me tell you what my mom told me. Yeah it's gonna suck, but you gotta think about someone else coming after you. Go home, pour a gin and tonic or whatever your beverage of choice and rethink it and get up tomorrow and do it again. It is exhausting, but you have to do it. You're eventually going to make this easier [for the next person].</p>
      <p>And I was talking to a young white woman who told me she was at an industry event in New York City and one of the wine guys said, You should come and sit on my lap while I pour this wine. And I said, Oh, gross; did anyone say anything? And she said, No, not even the women. And that was the part that made me sad. There were two more women and nobody said anything. You're not an ally if you don't speak up. At that moment that women needed those women to speak up for her, she needed somebody and they failed her. So she just walked off and the women stayed and tasted with him. You don't stay, you say something immediately, and you move on. This enabled him: he said it in New York City and he's going to say it at some tasting in a smaller place, and there'll be some girl who is there who doesn't feel like she has power, or she may work for a wine distributer or an importer and feels she can't say anything. If he said it to the women tasting wine, he's saying it to the women selling it. It's happening, and it's happening on such a high level: #metoo has moved to food but it technically hasn't moved to the wine world. Until that happens, we still need women to protect younger women.</p>
      <p>Women also have to look to promote women. How are we going to make a difference, how is the landscape going to look, if we make it so much harder for other women to come to that table? How can we move people if they want leadership roles? How can we move more people into looking at wine? From the editorial side, how do we look at wine criticism differently? It's taking where we are now and moving it forward, and it's also lift as you climb. You can raise somebody else up because what the universe has for you is for you and it won't hurt you to help. You are the magic: don't be afraid to help someone else, don't block your blessings by not wanting to help anybody else. At the end of the day there's enough to go around.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wine as Life Strategies</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the eight years she's led the WWLS, Krieger has listened closely to the symposium's audience, and to the women whose wines are poured during the annual event. "Behind our efforts to create a meaningful and impactful symposium, attendee feedback has been vital," she wrote to me in an email. "Every year, we ask attendees to fill out an anonymous form or online survey. I save every email and have a note page on my iPhone so that I can jot down and save any comments I get in person. We want to celebrate our accomplishments and hear from successful women who come from a variety of backgrounds, including race, ethnicity and age. We want honest, frank, and sometimes difficult conversations. We want to gain information, learn about strategies and communication tools and hear about experiences that might be different from our own."</p>
      <p>The number of discussions, events, and organizations in the U.S. with a focus on equality and inclusion has been slowly rising — from the 2017-launched podcast <a href="https://www.loveandvines.com/thecolorofwine">The Color of Wine</a> to 2019's <a href="https://www.theblackwineexperience.com/">The Black Wine Experience festival</a> and the education-centered <a href="https://www.wine-empowered.com/">Wine Empowered</a>. When the first WWLS was <a href="https://www.womenwineleaders.com/2012-speakers">held in 2012</a>, "we weren’t sure what to expect," Kreiger says. "Eight years later, interest is stronger than ever, and attendees want to delve deeper into the topics that will help us, individually and collectively, create a better industry for everyone. Our audience has really shaped where the symposium goes. They want take-aways, strategies, something that helps their careers, their colleagues, and the industry. We wanted to do something that's practical, like the scholarship with Michelle. Like adding the postcard." At the symposium, each attendee is asked to write to herself, on a postcard provided by the WWLS, a note about her personal plan to support women in the industry. A few months later each card is mailed to its author, a very personal followup.</p>
      <p>As for the producers, "every year, we have four women winery owners or winemakers from around the world speak at the symposium," Krieger outlined. "Their perspectives are as varied as they are interesting. We appreciate their wines and the philosophy behind them, but it’s also wonderful to learn more about their experiences in terms of career-development, management, business practices and philosophies, and personal strategies and goal — topics that might not come up when we have, for instance, a winemaker lead a vertical tasting of her wines or a special wine-pairing dinner. When we stop and ask, what is it like to be a women in wine, what are some of your experiences, we hear stories that otherwise we wouldn't. Overall, we are seeing more and more women at the helm, leading wineries on both the business and winemaking side. Their insights and personal stories are all so very different. We have heard from many women vintners who years ago were one of the only women in their class to graduate with a degree in enology —now they are mentoring both male and female winemakers. Since most wineries that we work with are family-owned and -run, we also hear a lot about the challenges and benefits of working with family. I've noticed that we're starting to get to the point where the new generation isn't just the sons; we're working with more and more women in leadership roles at the wineries."</p>
      <p>And checking in on Italy — as one of my special-interest areas and also a country that is always represented at the symposium, thanks to Winebow's all-Italy <a href="https://www.winebow.com/imports/lls/">LLS division</a> — while as in many European wine-making countries there is an emphasis on the family, "what's interesting with Italy, is that we also have quite a few women who forged their own wineries," Krieger told me by phone. <a href="http://scuola24.ilsole24ore.com/art/universita-e-ricerca/2018-02-14/un-master-il-futuro-imprese-familiari-204131.php?uuid=AEIJZK0D">Sixty-four %</a> of Italian companies are family-owned. Of the Italian women born into it, "we worked with [third-generation, iconic Sardinian producer] Valentina <a href="https://www.winebow.com/our-brands/argiolas/">Argiolas</a> for years, and then finally took the time to ask, so what's it like working with your family? What challenges do you have, you have three kids, and a winery?" Argiolas's answer included a Italy-specific strategy: "There's a master's program specifically for people who are in <a href="https://businessschool.luiss.it/family-business-management/en/">family-owned businesses</a>. And she took that coursework and talked to us about how helpful it was." Other Italian women "have found it extremely valuable to gain experience outside of the winery, even in other industry sectors, before joining the family business and learning to navigate the realm of family dynamics.</p>
      <p>And some women winery owners had pursued, sometimes very successfully, a completely different career path, only to be happily drawn back into the family winery that was a significant part of their childhood. Someone like Silvia Imparato from <a href="https://www.winebow.com/our-brands/montevetrano/">Montevetrano</a> of Campania was a photographer who decided to rebuild her family's vineyards. We have someone like Alicia <a href="https://www.winebow.com/our-brands/lini/">Lini</a> who inherited a winery but actually had another life and then came back." Stories, too, "of women entrepreneurs who became winery owners outside of any family connection, perhaps taking a risk to follow a dream and their love of the land. Elisabetta Gnudi was a pharmacist and she could have just gone her merry way, but had this dream and loved <a href="https://www.winebow.com/our-brands/altesino/">Tuscan wine</a>." The ranks include older women as well, later winemakers who carefully honed their dream before pursuing it.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day, the wines are about the people behind them who work so hard to represent the land that they care so much about. Gaining insight into the personal and professional journeys of the women producers we represent adds another, enriching dimension from which we can further appreciate their wines and winemaking philosophies," Krieger wrote to me. "I hope that others are as inspired and enriched by their career advice and approach to life as I am."</p>
