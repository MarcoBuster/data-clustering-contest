      <p>So far, in this 4-part series on break-ups and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/friends">friendship</a>, a few important themes have been included:</p>
      <p>• <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-grown/201911/how-be-just-friends-after-break">Safely releasing feelings</a> of loss and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/grief">grief</a>.</p>
      <p>• Deciding whether you’re becoming “friends” for the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-grown/201911/how-be-just-friends-after-break-0">right reasons</a>.</p>
      <p>• Giving yourself time to heal. And managing when <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-grown/201911/how-be-just-friends-after-break-1">children are in the picture</a>.</p>
      <p>Two more questions to close this series.</p>
      <p>Starting with:</p>
      <p>
        <b>What if your partner is emotionally-sore, but you're not (or vice versa)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No matter what, it’s important to respect your ex’s pain and grieving process. This can include taking a step back and giving them space to feel their loss.</p>
      <p>It’s also possible to support their emotional wellbeing by keeping contact to a minimum and giving them time to work through their feelings, if they choose.</p>
      <p>When one — or both — former partners are grieving the loss of the relationship, this is understandably not a good time to be transitioning into a friendship. That tends to only prolong the grief.</p>
      <p>If you find it difficult to step back, it can be useful to reflect on the following question:</p>
      <p>
        <i>“What am I needing? What’s stopping me from letting go?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>For many people, it can be the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> of never finding love again. Clinging to an ex out of fear and need, not true friendship and respect.</p>
      <p>Whatever you are needing … ideally, you would want to try to give it to yourself.</p>
      <p>It’s possible to reassure yourself. “I will find love again.” It’s possible to connect to your own strength.</p>
      <p>It’s possible to reach within and access some self-love to comfort yourself as you step back.</p>
      <p>Remember that the love you felt for your ex remains within you forever. If and/or when you want to, it is possible to draw on those loving memories and be nurtured by them.</p>
      <p>If you’re the one in emotional pain, consider taking a step back as well… tending to your emotions, first — before even considering entering the friend-zone.</p>
      <p>Each former partner would be well-served to grieve their own loss, fully. This may include letting themselves cry. A lot.</p>
      <p>If your ex is encouraging a friendship, prematurely, consider saying something like, <i>“I need to take some time before even trying to be friends.”</i> If your ex is persistent, you might need to assert something like, <i>“No, not now.”</i> If the next question is, “When?,” a possible response might be something like, <i>“I don’t know. But I know I need more time.”</i></p>
      <p>It’s important to not let yourself be manipulated or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/guilt">guilt</a>-tripped into giving up the time that you need to heal… with self-care being a top priority, right now.</p>
      <p>Onto the final question:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are there certain situations where it’s not even worth trying?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here are just a few to consider:</p>
      <p>— If there was physical or emotional abuse in a relationship.</p>
      <p>— If you don’t want your ex to start <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mating">dating</a> again (that’s not a real friendship).</p>
      <p>— If the break-up was because of incompatibility in personalities or worldview (a friendship may be a stretch).</p>
      <p>— If one or both former partners aren’t willing to resolve their negative emotions — and if there are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/jealousy">jealousy</a> or control issues, or someone’s holding a grudge.</p>
      <p>— If both former partners are still trying to get over each other (now’s most likely not the time for ongoing contact).</p>
      <p>— If the former partners have a pattern of breaking up and then making up … (an opportunity to stop the habitual cycle).</p>
      <p>— If an ex is still acting like a boyfriend / girlfriend, but won’t commit. (They may be using the other ex, until they find something better).</p>
      <p>
        <b>To echo the first question in the series: is it possible?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Can two former lovers ever “just be friends?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>— Not according to Harry Burns: “… men and women can’t be friends because the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex">sex</a> part always gets in the way.” (played by Billy Crystal, in <i>When Harry Met Sally</i>.)</p>
      <p>— In 10 seasons of the TV series <i>Friends</i>, Rachel and Ross (played by Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer) got together and broke up multiple times, but wound up together in the end; and …</p>
      <p>— Julia Roberts realized that she had strong feelings for her best friend (played by Dermot Mulroney) in <i>My Best Friend’s Wedding</i>. Remaining “just friends” … just wouldn’t cut it.</p>
      <p>But since there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this age-old question, each person gets to decide what’s best for them.</p>
      <p>A few general tips to reflect on:</p>
      <p>• Try not to over-think it.</p>
      <p>• Give your motivations and emotions some <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a>.</p>
      <p>• It’s not wise to keep one foot in the past because you’re afraid of the future.</p>
      <p>• It’s wise to heal your feelings about the break-up.</p>
      <p>With time and lots of self-love, former partners can move forward into whatever future each one desires — with their ex as a friend or not — in wholeness and health.</p>
      <p>And eventually … when you’re ready?</p>
      <p>Your next great love may just be waiting, as well.<br/>. . .</p>
