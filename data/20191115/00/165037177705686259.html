        <b>The Miami game is off. The judge has backed the Spanish Federation's position (RFEF) and the Villarreal v Atletico Madrid will not be played in the USA. The actual court case will be in February, but La Liga had asked to be given dispensation to play there until the case was heard. This has not been granted though.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>LaLiga have been trying for a few months to get the game played in Miami</b> to increase the popularity of Spanish football in the USA, but some clubs have opposed this. </p>
      <p>Villarreal versus <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/atletico-madrid/">Atletico Madrid</a> (two clubs who back the proposal) in matchday 16 was the match chosen. <b>The kick-off time has been set for 10pm CET </b>on Friday 6th December. </p>
      <p>However, <b>the match will not take place in Miami</b>. The judge of court number 12 in Madrid confirmed the news. Tomas Gonzalez Cueto of the RFEF said <b>"LaLiga's request was just explaining that they had an agreement with USA </b>and the RFEF thought it was vital to know who was the organiser of the game. They could be an entity which does not comply with the federation's rules." This is according to 'Cadena SER'. </p>

      <p>LaLiga responded with a statement after the judge's decision which said<b> they respect the decision and will wait until February 2020</b> to carry on with their idea of taking a La Liga match to Miami. For the time being, <b>all the matches will remain in Spain</b>. </p>
      <p>
        <b>This was La Liga's message:</b>
      </p>
      <p>"The judge of court number 12 in Madrid has decided not to give LaLiga dispensation to play the game in Miami, USA.<b> LaLiga wishes to express its greatest respect to a decision</b> which does not affect the wider issue which will take place at a definitive hearing in February 2020. It is a long term strategy for the intenrational growth of the league.<b> We hope to be able to play a game abroad after that date</b>. Bringing the clubes closer to their global fans represents an important opportunity to continue working on LaLiga's following around the world."</p>
      <p><b>"This international growth leads to a benefit for the clubs themselves</b>, their players, their fans, LaLiga as a whole, Spanish football and the Spain brand."</p>
