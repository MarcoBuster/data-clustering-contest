        <b>Tite waited until the second half of the Brazil-Argentina game to bring on Rodrygo Goes, Real Madrid's new sensation, who made his official debut with the international team. The fans expect a lot from him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Brazil coach had <b>praised Rodrygo a lot in the build up to the game</b>, although he had also warned that he would not start. He stuck to his word. Although he also had the moral obligation to give a few of the new, in-form Brazilian's their debut.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/rodrygo-365923/">Rodrygo</a>, who in his insulting youthÂ <b>scored a hat-trick in the Champions League </b>with Real Madrid. has put himself on the front page. This is why he got a chance to play for the senior team after impressing in the academy.</p>
      <p>As if this weren't enough, despite being a friendly, his debut was also against an unforgettable opponent:<b> Leo Messi's Argentina.</b></p>

      <p>The young attacker came on the pitch<b> in place of Willian in the 71st minute</b> to try to give more dynamic to the attack, then the Brazilian's <b>lost 0-1 after a goal from Messi </b>in the first half from the rebound of a penalty that was saved by Alisson.</p>
      <p><b>The Real Madrid player didn't have much time </b>to show what he can do, as he stuck to the right side, even though he can play where he likes.</p>
