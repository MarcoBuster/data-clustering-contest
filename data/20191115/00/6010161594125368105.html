      <p>Rust, the rather brutal survival multiplayer game, is heading to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
      <p>Facepunch and Double Eleven announced today Rust will be released on Xbox One and PS4 in 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/tag/rust/">If you aren’t familiar with Rust</a>, in it you wake up on a post-apocalyptic island with nothing but a rock and a torch. You will need to figure out how to keep yourself alive by conquering thirst and hunger.</p>
      <p>The elements play a part as well, so you will need to create clothing and a cabin in the woods. You will also have to contend with scientists, bears, wolves and maybe even radiation poisoning.</p>
      <p>The biggest threat to your survival though is the other players. This is truly a survival player vs player environment full of combat, raiding, and looting.</p>

      <p>Make friends, because you will need them. But in the end, it’s<a href="https://www.vg247.com/2013/06/24/players-should-decide-how-to-play-rust-says-newman/"> entirely up to you as to how the game is played</a>. Make friends, be a jerk, it’s all about choice.</p>
      <p>Since Rust’s launch on Steam Early Access in 2013, almost 8 million folks have made it one of the most played games on Steam.</p>
