        <b>President of Ghana Nana Akufo-Addo has lauded the performance of the Black Stars in their 2-0 victory over South Africa in the opening fixture of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The senior national team brought massive smiles to the faces of Ghanaians as they commenced the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers with a comfortable 2-0 win over South Africa at the Cape Coast Stadium on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The Black Stars had a brilliant start to the game where they enjoyed the lion share of possession. Thomas Partey opened the scoring with a beauty, firing from long range in the 35th minute.</p>
      <p>The visitors didn’t coil in and forced their way through for an equalizer but the back of the net eluded them, even though they played much better until the break.</p>
      <p>Ghana returned from the recess a much more stronger side and once again dominated play. Kudus Mohammed made his debut, one that he won’t forget anytime soon. He replaced Alfred Duncan in the 61st minute.</p>
      <p>The youngster took his chance very well after a solo effort and wrote his name in gold with a beautiful curler in the 80th minute to win it for the Stars. First job done in the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>President Akufo-Addo took to twitter to hail the team's display in the match.</p>
