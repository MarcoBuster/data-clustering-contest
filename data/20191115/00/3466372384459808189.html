      <p>Google tells me that the real Napoleon Bonaparte used somewhat more vivid imagery to rhetorically raise and dismiss the question, what's a throne? For my limited purpose this week, I'm content to use what Rod Steiger, playing him in the 1970 classic <i>Waterloo</i>, said.</p>
      <p>Something like, what's a throne? It's an overpriced piece of furniture.</p>
      <p>This was still the early 19th century, a throne still mattered.</p>
      <p>In most of the modern world, it doesn't even exist.</p>
      <p>Nationalism has crept back pan-nationally to some extent lately, yet the symbols of the nation-State -- thrones, crowns, anthems, flags -- have generally faded from our consciousness.</p>
      <p>They haven't gone away, though.</p>
      <p>Sportspersons take these very seriously at championships, for example.</p>
      <p>It is just that the modern nation-State is more stable and secure and the value of such symbols has become commemorative, less existential.</p>
      <p>We can, therefore, follow up this argument with a rhetorical, but relevant question of our own: What is a flag? Would today's Napoleon have said, hah, an over-rated piece of cloth? Probably not.</p>
      <p>But his lancers would not have gone to fight Wellington at Waterloo today, holding the great banner aloft.</p>
      <p>Times change, people change, and symbols change.</p>
      <p>The reason we bring in an apparently far-out question like 'what's a flag' is because that is the issue still holding up the long-drawn-out process to finally end India's oldest, and bloodiest, insurgency, Nagaland.</p>
      <p>Both the Indian State and the Nagas accept they have done terrible things to each other, that violence no longer works.</p>
      <p>The Nagas still want a flag of their own, to share the Kohima skyline with the national tricolour.</p>
      <p>The Modi government isn't willing to concede that.</p>
      <p>Negotiations have now reached a level where the government says you can have a flag for cultural and ethnic occasions.</p>
      <p>The Nagas say that will be a bit like an NGO having its own flag.</p>
      <p>Banking leader K V Kamath has a brilliant line on the art of negotiation.</p>
      <p>The best negotiation, he says, is where both sides leave the table just a little unhappy.</p>
      <p>Translated, it means, each one concedes something they would have preferred not to.</p>
      <p>For Muivah's Nagas, to sign up without the consolation of a flag is humiliation.</p>
      <p>For the Modi government, the choice is equally tough.</p>
      <p>Just on October 31, it celebrated taking down the flag of Jammu and Kashmir and presented the idea as a tribute to Sardar Patel, whose birth anniversary it coincided with.</p>
      <p>How do they concede to a tribal state of just about 3 million people what they have taken away from one much bigger as a statement of rejuvenated Indian nationalism?</p>
      <p>The idea of symbolism for the BJP government of Narendra Modi is a far cry from Vajpayee's.</p>
      <p>Asked how Kashmiri separatists would negotiate if India insisted that it be within the framework of its Constitution, Vajpayee had disarmingly replied, we will talk within the parameters of humanity (<i>insaniyat</i>).</p>
      <p>Modi's BJP has moved back to harder, inflexible, and, if I may add with some caution, more abrasive nationalism.</p>
      <p>Such nationalism can't be 'cool' about its symbols.</p>
      <p>That's why the lowering of one state's flag is celebrated, another one demanding it is resisted and a third one (Karnataka) still having one of its own reluctantly tolerated.</p>
      <p>No cinema hall dares to stop playing the National Anthem even after the Supreme Court withdrew its own order.</p>
      <p>People are harassed if they refuse to stand up in movie halls.</p>
      <p>It's as if the new generation of Indians have to prove to each other once again that they aren't just patriots, but nationalists.</p>
      <p>This BJP is much closer to its ideological founding fathers' vision of <i>ek vidhan, ek nishan, ek pradhan</i> (one Constitution, one symbol, and one leader) for all of India.</p>
      <p>To that extent India has moved several steps back into its mindset of the paranoid 1960s.</p>
      <p>If you, like me, are a child of the 1960s, and step back into that decade, imagining the India of today would be an impossibility.</p>
      <p>We had four full wars and several small ones between 1961 (Goa) and 1971 (Bangladesh).</p>
      <p>Would our generation have imagined that 1971 was the last real war India would fight for the next five decades?</p>
      <p>Would we have imagined that by this time India would have subsumed all its insurgencies and separatist political movements?</p>
      <p>Respected scholars, most notably American Selig Harrison, were talking about an inevitable break-up of India in that 'dangerous decade'.</p>
      <p>India proved them wrong, and today, it stands at the most secure juncture in its history, politically, strategically, militarily and economically, never mind the recent trouble.</p>
      <p>I must underline that this hasn't happened after 2014.</p>
      <p>I go back to around 2003, post Op Parakram and India's use of coercive diplomacy as this turning point.</p>
      <p>So, this virtuous epoch of a secure India has matured over more than 15 years now.</p>
      <p>You cannot see this reversing easily.</p>
      <p>Not externally. Nor internally, unless our politics messes up our social cohesion.</p>
      <p>India is now far too strong and important for anyone to push it around, or grab any territory.</p>
      <p>This is when we Indians should have also felt that sense of security and enjoyed this well-earned comfort.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, we have brought back some familiar old insecurities again.</p>
      <p>You will find the reason in the politics of the Modi-Shah BJP.</p>
      <p>See it this way.</p>
      <p>The critics of this government charge it, with some <i>schadenfreude</i>, with having internationalised the Kashmir issue.</p>
      <p>This is a fact.</p>
      <p>But today India is strong enough to take this degree of internationalisation in its stride.</p>
      <p>Until today, three months after the August 5 changes, no nation other than the three usual suspects has asked India to reverse them.</p>
      <p>The rest pretty much concede this -- if mostly in silence -- as India's internal affair.</p>
      <p>Of course, it cannot go on like this forever.</p>
      <p>Kashmir has to see much greater normalcy much faster, its politicians and prominent people can't remain detained for too long and the communication denial has to end.</p>
      <p>Or international pressure will rise and even friendly governments, like Trump's, for example, will find it difficult to stay aloof.</p>
      <p>And if normalcy returned, would Kashmir continue to play so strongly in the national consciousness?</p>
      <p>Or, more bluntly, will it still feed mass insecurity and thereby hyper-nationalism?</p>
      <p>The challenge with the new situation in Kashmir isn't that it's been internationalised, but that it's been internalised as never before.</p>
      <p>Trouble in Kashmir means threat from Pakistan, radical Islam, a fifth column, jihadi terror, and so on.</p>
      <p>It is a straight and unbroken thread of national insecurity.</p>
      <p>With the economy declining and job losses, the need to not just retain but strengthen this hyper-nationalist push is even stronger.</p>
      <p>From that vantage point, there isn't much electoral percentage in saying we are so wonderfully secure.</p>
      <p>Because then, how do you run your politics without the fear of the 'other'?</p>
      <p>In the decades between 1972 and 2014, Indian nationalism had evolved into a more relaxed, secure, and comfortable state of mind.</p>
      <p>We are being dragged back from those times, into fighting once again the fears we thought we had defeated 50 years ago.</p>
      <p>It is fascinating that it is precisely in this mood that two contrary games are playing out: Where the denial of a flag to one is a national celebration, and conceding one to the other looms as an inconvenient compulsion.</p>
