      <p>Black Friday is a big business — and it’s only getting bigger. Every year, consumers spend more and more on all kinds of products during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday season. And retailers can’t afford to miss out.As one of the biggest retailers in the world, Walmart's all too keenly aware of this. The retailer has been rolling out some stellar deals over the past few weeks in anticipation of the big event. </p>
      <p>Tablets may not be as popular as they once were, but a great iPad or Android tablet can make mobile gaming or watching TV in bed a whole lot more immersive. Not only that, but they can be super helpful for productivity too. If you're looking to get portable, productive, and efficient, here are some of the best pre-Black Friday deals on tablets from Walmart.</p>
      <h3>Apple iPad (6th Gen) 32GB Wi-Fi + Cellular</h3>

      <p>The Apple iPad is still the gold standard when it comes to tablets. The device is easy to use, looks great, and is super portable. </p>
      <p>The most recent model of the iPad has a 9.7-inch vivid Retina display. It basically sets the standard for tablets as their own devices, and not just upgraded, over-sized smartphones. The 6th Generation Apple iPad is like the best of both worlds, however. It doesn't weigh much more than a phone, weighing only a pound and being only 7.5mm thin. </p>
      <p>Whether you're a content creator looking to make a video and other media on the go, without carrying a bulky laptop, or you want to be more productive at work or school, the Apple iPad will help you reach your goals. This model also has cellular connectivity, so you won’t have to rely on Wi-Fi all the time, and it’s available for only $299, which is $160 off its original price of $459.</p>

      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A is essentially Samsung’s answer to the iPad, offering a 10.1-inch display that will look great while watching movies or TV shows. The device was recently revamped to offer a much sleeker form-factor, along with 32GB of storage and a battery that will last up to an impressive 13 hours.</p>
      <p>The tablet has Android 9.0 Pie built into it, and through that operating system, you’ll be able to take advantage of Google Assistant and integrate the device with any other Samsung devices you have. The device is a pretty solid performer too -- offering a Samsung-built processor.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Tab A normally comes at $227.99 -- but it’s currently available from Walmart for an impressive $197 -- which is $30 off its original price.</p>

      <p>Perhaps you’re looking for a decent tablet on a serious budget, in which case one of Samsung’s older tablets might do the trick.

The device is pretty portable too, thanks to its 7-inch display, and it has Android built into it -- albeit a slightly old version of Android. </p>
      <p>The tablet normally comes at $127.99, but it’s currently available for $77.99, or $50 off its original price.</p>
