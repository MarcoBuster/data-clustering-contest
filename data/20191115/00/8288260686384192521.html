      <p>A first look at Michael Sheen as Chris Tarrant in the upcoming ITV drama Quiz has been revealed.</p>
      <p>Sheen will play quiz show host Tarrant in the show based on the infamous Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? cheating scandal.</p>
      <p>The photograph shows Sheen in character arriving to give evidence at Southwark Crown Court in the 2003 trial of former army major Charles Ingram, who won £1 million on the quiz.</p>
      <p>Dubbed the 'coughing major', Ingram was found guilty along with his wife Diana and their accomplice Tecwen Whittock of cheating their way to the top prize on the show in 2001.</p>
      <p>Ingram, who will be played by Matthew Macfadyen, was accused of listening out for coughs from college lecturer Whittock, who was sitting in the studio audience, to signal to him which answers were correct.</p>
