      <p>"I say this with conviction: we trust Hansi Flick," Rummenigge said after the win over Olympiakos which sent Bayern into the last 16 of the Champions League with <b>two games to spare.</b></p>
      <p>The 4-0 thumping of Dortmund last Saturday moved Bayern up to third in the league four points <b>adrift of leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach.</b></p>
