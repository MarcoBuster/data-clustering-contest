      <p>The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. shares fell sharply in early trading following a $20.1-million third quarter loss for the cannabis company as the industry struggles to meet expectations.</p>
      <p>Its stock fell about eight per cent to 76 cents soon after the open at the Toronto Stock Exchange, on top of a 9.8 per cent decline on Thursday before the results were released.</p>
      <p>The Mississauga-based company says its loss increased from $11.3-million in the same quarter last year as costs rose from its expansion towards commercial production.</p>
      <p>The results worked out to a loss of seven cents per share for the quarter ending Sept. 30, up from a loss of four cents in the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>The company says it invested $104-million in capital spending in the quarter, including the continued construction of two facilities in Ontario and Quebec.</p>
      <p>It announced in October that it was significantly scaling back the timeline of its project in Valleyfield, Que., to reduce its cash needs.</p>
      <p>Along with announcing its third quarter results, the company announced arrangements for up to $103 million in funding that includes the sale and leaseback of its facility in Ancaster, Ont.</p>
