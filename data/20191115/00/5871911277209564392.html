      <p>One of the NFL’s biggest rising stars recently met arguably one of the best basketball players on the planet recently, and he was taken aback by it.</p>
      <p>Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, who the team selected with the No. 1 overall pick in this year’s draft, hit up Tuesday’s Lakers-Suns game at Talking Stick Resort Arena. He was there to watch LeBron James, and apparently even got to interact with the Lakers star for a brief moment.</p>
      <p>Murray told reporters about it at his weekly press conference on Thursday, and apparently he was “starstruck,” calling it like meeting Michael Jordan.</p>
