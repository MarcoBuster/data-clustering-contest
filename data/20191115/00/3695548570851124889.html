        <b>Audi World Touring Car Cup outfit WRT has withdrawn Gordon Shedden's car from the remainder of the Macau Guia Race weekend following chassis damage sustained in second qualifying.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shedden hit the tyre barrier at the tight Moorish right-hander late on in Q1 and, while the Hondas of Tiago Monteiro and Esteban Guerrieri were able to avoid his RS3 LMS, the car was then rear-ended by the unsighted Norbert Michelisz.</p>
      <p>That blocked the track, with a Q1-ending red flag shown immediately in order to recover the two cars.</p>

      <p>Audi confirmed on Friday evening that the damage to Shedden's car was too severe for it to be repaired at the circuit.</p>
      <p>A statement released on Audi Sport's twitter account night read: "Due to accident damage sustained in today's final FIA WTCR qualifying at Macau, Leopard Racing Team Audi Sport withdraws the Audi RS 3 LMS of Gordon Shedden for the remainder of the ninth race weekend."</p>
      <p>Shedden had been 16th at the time of his crash, but had his fastest time deleted for causing a red flag, and instead would have started both the second and third races 23rd. He was 24th in the first qualifying session, which set the grid for Saturday's opening race.</p>

      <p>Title hopeful Michelisz, who qualified second for race one, said the crash was a "disappointing" end to his participation but expects his car to be fit to race, despite his Hyundai i30 N's front-left corner sustaining significant damage.</p>
      <p>"We had the car today to progress to Q2, then probably even to fight for the top five," he said.</p>
      <p>"The strategy was to have Gabriele [Tarquini] with the slipstream, we did two attempts in the end.</p>
      <p>"We had to push to get to the line for the last run, and in the end at Turn 16, it's a blind corner, Shedden went into the barrier, he was blocking half of the circuit and I collected him. I couldn't do anything to be honest to avoid this.</p>
      <p>"Still we have a good chance tomorrow in race one to score big, and also starting from P12 there are points on the table.</p>
      <p>"My main aim is to collect as many points as possible, we are still in a good position to score points in all the three races."</p>
