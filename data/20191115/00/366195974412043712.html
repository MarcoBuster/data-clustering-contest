      <p>He's shared enigmatic messages to suggest that he's lovelorn, but on "Reply," <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/liluzivert/profile/">Lil Uzi Vert</a> is doing just fine not being tied down to any woman. A <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/boogie/profile">Boogie</a> Wit da Hoodie shared his Uzi-assisted single on Friday, a sex-fueled track made for the ladies. This is but one of many singles Boogie and Uzi have in the vault as the former shared with <i><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8528674/a-boogie-interview-audiomack">Billboard</a> </i>back in August.</p>
      <p>"It's that real genuine sh*t when you link up with an artist," Boogie said about why he and Uzi click. "F*ck the cameras. When it's off-cameras, that's when it's real. You don't gotta see the love on video. This sh*t is real life. This sh*t we talking about is our real thoughts and sh*t. We be talking about sh*t that we go through." Check out "Reply" and let us know if these two have a hit on their hands.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If I write you girl, will you reply?<br/>Follow my commands, come on girl, comply<br/>You only want me 'cause my life's televised<br/>And I can see all the lies in your eyes<br/>But I'm no different, selling dreams for tonight<br/>Just so I can have my way, rubbin' on your thighs<br/>In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties</p>
