      <h2>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.34 percent. Japan's Nikkei added 0.58 percent and Australian shares gained 0.53 percent.</h2>

      <p>Asian equities rose on Friday after the S&amp;P 500 index notched a new record closing high, but investor sentiment remained fragile following weak data from China and Germany, which reinforced concerns about the global economy.</p>
      <p>Early in the Asian trading day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.34 percent. Japan's Nikkei added 0.58 percent and Australian shares gained 0.53 percent.</p>
      <p>The safe-haven yen weakened, with the dollar rising 0.11 percent to buy 108.50 yen. The euro was unchanged at USD 1.1021 and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals was flat at 98.163.</p>

      <p>Providing a fillip to investor confidence in Asia were comments from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that Washington was getting close to a trade agreement with China.</p>
      <p>Higher US Treasury yields also indicated a slight risk-on tone in the Asian session, with the 10-year yield rising to 1.8307 percent from a US close of 1.815 percent on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The policy-sensitive two-year yield rose to 1.6036 percent from 1.593 percent on Thursday after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of the US economy facing a dramatic bust is remote.</p>
      <p>A Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed that while concerns have eased over a US recession, few see an economic rebound, and most believe a trade truce is unlikely in the coming year.</p>
      <p>Global sentiment has been buffeted in recent weeks by conflicting assessments of progress in talks between the United States and China aimed at ending their 16-month-long trade war.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, China’s commerce ministry said that the two countries are holding “in-depth” discussions on a first phase trade agreement, and that cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal.</p>
      <p>China has also ended a nearly five-year ban on imports of US poultry meat, which the US Trade Representative said would lead to more than USD 1 billion in annual shipments to China.</p>
      <p>Those developments followed comments from officials from both countries last week that they had a deal to roll back tariffs, only to have US President Donald Trump deny that any such deal had been agreed to.</p>
      <p>The new record for the S&amp;P, which gained just 0.08 percent to 3,096.63, came despite a grim outlook from network gear maker Cisco Systems that underlined the impact of trade uncertainty.</p>
      <p>The company forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below expectations as increasingly global economic uncertainties kept clients away from spending more on its routers and switches, sending its shares down 7.3 percent.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.01 percent 27,781.96 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.04 percent to 8,479.02.</p>
      <p>European shares also fell after data showed the German economy grew just 0.1 percent in the third quarter, with consumer spending helping the country to avoid a mild contraction.</p>
      <p>“In further diminishing the likelihood of significant fiscal stimulus from the Berlin government, it was not good news at all,” analysts at National Australia Bank said in a morning note.</p>
      <p>The German data followed numbers from China indicating a faster-than-expected slowdown in factory output growth in October due to weak domestic and global demand.</p>
      <p>In commodity markets, US crude prices rebounded after sliding Thursday on rising US crude inventories. US West Texas Intermediate crude was 0.37 percent higher at USD 56.98 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Gold retreated from gains prompted by trade uncertainty. Spot gold was last trading at USD 1,466.98 per ounce, down 0.27 percent.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
