        <b>Sebastian Vettel led a Ferrari 1-2 in the second free practice session for Formula 1's Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vettel hit the front early on when using the medium-compound Pirellis, setting a best time of 1m09.570s - a quarter of a second ahead of second-quickest Charles Leclerc.</p>
      <p>When the field switched to the soft-compound Pirellis for performance runs, Vettel initially struggled to improve after hitting traffic on his first quick lap.</p>
      <p>This allowed Leclerc to move into the lead with a lap of 1m09.238s before Vettel reclaimed top spot with a time of 1m09.217s.</p>
      <p>Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was one of the last to start his qualifying simulation run, jumping to third place with a lap 0.134s off the pace.</p>
      <p>He set the fastest middle sector time of all on that lap, but lost a tenth to the Ferraris in the power-dependent final sector.</p>
      <p>Mercedes duo Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton were fourth and fifth fastest respectively, with the former 0.156s off the pace.</p>
      <p>Hamilton was 0.223s down and wasn't able to post a time until his third attempt, with one lap aborted at the first corner after going deep then having to go off track to avoid Pierre Gasly's Toro Rosso - which was attempting to let him past.</p>

      <p>Kevin Magnussen was a surprise sixth in the Haas, which tends to go well in the cool conditions that prevailed on Friday, with Renault's Daniel Ricciardo just behind.</p>
      <p>Alfa Romeo driver Kimi Raikkonen was among the first to set a qualifying simulation time, which briefly put him fifth before he was shuffled back to eighth - the last driver within a second of the pace.</p>
      <p>Red Bull's Alex Albon had a difficult session and only made a small improvement on his medium-tyre pace when running softs, meaning he was shuffled down to ninth place ahead of McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr.</p>
      <p>Nico Hulkenberg was 11th in the second Renault, 1.108s off the pace and just ahead of the Toro Rosso of Gasly.</p>
      <p>Gasly's session came to a premature end with 20 minutes remaining when he pulled over with smoke emerging from the rear of the car.</p>
      <p>He confirmed it was an engine problem over the radio, with the virtual safety car being deployed.</p>
      <p>Antonio Giovinazzi was 13th in the second Alfa Romeo, pipping Daniil Kvyat by just 0.005s.</p>
      <p>Kvyat brought the session to a premature end with five minutes remaining when the red flag flew after he slid into the barrier with the right-rear corner at the Juncao left-hander as the rears locked up thanks to an apparent engine problem.</p>
      <p>Racing Point duo Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll were 15th and 17th, sandwiching the second Haas of Romain Grosjean.</p>
      <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris was 18th, 1.483s down, with George Russell slowest of the drivers to set a time in 19th.</p>

      <p>Robert Kubica, who sat out the first session to allow Nicholas Latifi to drive, didn't set a time after crashing at the Turn 3 left-hander on his first flying lap early on.</p>
      <p>The rear stepped out and Kubica corrected, only to fire the car the other way and into the outside barrier - bringing his session to an end and leading to a seven-minute red flag.</p>
