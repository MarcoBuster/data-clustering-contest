      <h1>OK, Boomer! 5 Retirement Tips From Boomers (And Why Millennials Should Listen)</h1>

      <p>Baby boomers and millennials don’t always get along. Boomers see millennials as lazy and <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/millennial-myths-and-realities">self-absorbed</a>. Millennials think boomers are too stuck in their ways and <a href="https://www.workfront.com/blog/baby-boomers-vs-millennials">not productive</a>. Both stereotypes are <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/06/workplaces">unfair</a>. In my own experience as a millennial, many boomers carry a lot of wisdom and are looking for open-minded people to share it with. And most millennials I know want to learn from the older generations but don’t know how to ask.</p>
      <p>That’s why I started asking boomers their advice on a pointy subject: retirement. As many boomers head into retirement with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2018/09/27/Baby-boomers-wealth-heirs-inheritance-taxes-intra-family-mortgage-loans-life-insurance/stories/201809260126">a decent amount of money</a>, at least <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-say-they-cant-afford-to-save-for-retirement-2019-10">half</a> of us millennials can stand to learn from them.</p>

      <p>I asked boomers from different backgrounds what they would tell millennials about retirement. What did they wish they’d known when they were millennial age? Here’s what they said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Start Early</b>
      </p>
      <p>Almost every boomer said these two words: “Start early.” Close to <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/retirement-savings-study/">a third of retirees</a> wish they had saved more aggressively for retirement. One person told me, “Invest heavy early, often, and consistently over time.”</p>
      <p>The reason is compound interest. Whether <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/compound-interest/">Einstein</a> called it the most powerful force in the universe or not, compound interest offers unbelievable power to savers in their 30s, 20s, and teens. But that power fades the older you get because you’ve got fewer years for the interest to compound.</p>
      <p>Today, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-age-when-americans-start-saving-for-retirement.html">half of adults</a> between 18 and 34 aren’t saving anything for retirement. It’s admittedly tough for millennials to save. Providing for family, paying mortgage or rent, and surviving crushing debt like student loans all get in the way.</p>
      <p>But there’s never a convenient time to save for retirement, and our responsibilities only grow with age. If we don’t start early, we lose one of the easiest ways to accumulate wealth. It’s a power we can’t afford to waste.</p>
      <p>That begs the question: How much should you save?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Live Below Your Means</b>
      </p>
      <p>Baby boomers gave me a wide range of percentages for how much to save. The bare minimum was 10%, and it went all the way up to 25%. This week, I found <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/millennials-need-to-save-an-huge-percent-of-paycheck-to-retire-at-65.html">an article</a> saying millennials should save 40% for retirement!</p>
      <p>Those numbers stress me out. Maybe they stress you out, too. That might be because we’re not living below our means.</p>
      <p>62% of millennials say they’re living <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/62-percent-of-millennials-say-they-are-living-paycheck-to-paycheck.html">paycheck to paycheck</a>. We could blame modern American capitalism, but the truth is what we save now will likely be what we have to rely on in retirement. To be ready, you need to make lifestyle sacrifices now.</p>
      <p>As millennials, we should delay gratification and save as much as we can early on. We’ll be glad we did.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Create Multiple Income Streams</b>
      </p>
      <p>65% of all consumers have a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/survey-most-consumers-second-stream-174548029.html">second source of income</a>. Millennials already make more money from secondary incomes than other generations, and that dependence may continue into retirement.</p>
      <p>Savvy boomers understand the benefit of multiple income streams. Pensions <a href="https://20somethingfinance.com/pensions-vs-401ks-why-you-should-care-that-pensions-are-going-extinct/">hardly exist now</a>, and Social Security <a href="https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/how-much-longer-will-social-security-be-around.html">likely won’t either</a> when millennials retire.</p>
      <p>That leaves your savings (401(k), IRA, Roth) and investments (stocks with dividends). But boomers told me you may need more than that to thrive.</p>
      <p>Boomers suggested streams like income from rent or hobbies and skills you can market. They said anything helps in retirement. “Even if it’s a small stream,” one boomer said, “it keeps you busy and creates cash flow.”</p>
      <p>Another option is working toward buying land or real estate early, then sitting on it for a while. One boomer advised if a buyer shows up with more than it’s worth, “sell the land and dump those proceeds into more land.”</p>
      <p>As millennials, we’ll need to get inventive if we want to thrive once we hit retirement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watch Your Money</b>
      </p>
      <p>Studies show <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/032216/are-we-baby-boomer-retirement-crisis.asp">45% of boomers</a> have no retirement savings due largely to the 2008 depression. As you can imagine, lots of boomers told me to keep active watch on my money. (Not surprisingly, they also warned about get-rich-quick schemes and substantial debt.)</p>
      <p>Boomers advised against setting up your 401(k), then never thinking about it again for 30 years. As millennials, we need to keep a close watch on what our money’s doing along with the market and economy.</p>
      <p>When I talked with boomers, they steered me toward fiduciaries — financial advisors who work for the best interest of the client instead of the firm. Good advisors help build a plan that spells out goals and moves you toward a target instead of an ambiguous future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Retire Early (But Don’t Stress)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some boomers advised me to retire as young as possible. Others mentioned everyone retires at different times in life. It’s best to stay content, even if you have to keep working later in life.</p>
      <p>If you can afford to retire early, boomers said it’s essential to stay productive with hobbies, travel, and volunteerism. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2017/06/30/most-americans-are-taking-vacations-they-cant-afford/#1df3a872577a">That costs money</a>, so prepare in advance (see #1).</p>
      <p>But even if we as millennials must retire later, boomers said don’t fret. “You can find joy in whatever you do,” one boomer said, “so don’t resent the fact you may have to work longer.” The key is to take care of your health and stay fit so working isn’t an issue.</p>
      <p>Regardless of when you retire, boomers said it’s important you don’t retire from your purpose in life. “The idea of a life of leisure in retirement is overrated,” one person told me. “You need meaningful engagement with others. That rarely comes without creative, productive work.”</p>
      <p>Most of all, don’t stress. It doesn’t help anything. Boomers said even if you’re not where you should be with savings, it’s never too late.</p>
      <p>Keep striving — your hard work will pay off. Stay positive and focused as you move toward the future you want.</p>
