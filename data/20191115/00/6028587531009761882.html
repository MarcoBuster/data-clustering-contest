      <p>Few will be surprised to hear that most of the wealthy in the U.K. live in London. But ask where would be the next wealthiest town or city and many would not know the answer.That is because such a huge gulf lies between London and any other town or city in the U.K. According to New World Wealth, a wealth research firm, London has 10,760 "multi-millionaires," or those with more than $10 million. Manchester, the next largest, has barely a tenth of that, with just 1,060 resident multi-millionaires.</p>
      <p>In fact, add up all the multi-millionaires in the other four wealthiest cities in the U.K. and they do not come close to London. Collectively, Manchester (1,060), Edinburgh (420), Birmingham (310) and Bristol (340), have a fifth of London's multi-millionaire population.</p>
      <p>The centralisation of wealth in the U.K. is even worse when you look at the towns and villages with less than 30,000 people, as New World Wealth has done. When it comes to multi-millionaires, 16 out of the richest 20 towns in the U.K. are all in the south east of the country. Windsor is the richest town, with 250 multi-millionaires, others lie in close proximity in Berkshire, Surrey, Oxfordshire or Buckinghamshire.</p>
      <p>These are mostly small historical towns, within an hour's commute from the capital. After Windsor, nearby Ascot has the most multi-millionaires, with 220. The remaining top 10 are all in the south east as well: Virginia Water, Leatherhead, Weybridge, Henley, Marlow Bray, Beaconsfield and Cookham.</p>
      <p>You have to get to 15th place to find a town or village that is not in the south east, Alderley Edge in Cheshire, which has 40 multi-millionaires. Others not in the south east include Hale in Trafford, Salcombe in Devon and Sandbanks in Dorset.</p>

      <h3>Technology Is Challenging London's Dominance</h3>
      <p>But technology is helping spread wealth beyond London to the regions of the U.K. "Technology is enabling people to run their businesses and not be centred in the south east," says Ben Covey, head of Private Banking at Santander.</p>
      <p>"You hear a lot of the time that technology takes jobs away but I think in the case of what we do technology has actually created jobs in the regions," says John-Paul Savant, whose business, ATG (Auction Technology Group), helps regional auction houses online sell their wares online. "There's a whole network of people supporting each of those auction houses," he adds.</p>
      <p>Julian Bambridge, CEO of Manchester-based MPM, a premium pet food company, says that talent has grown alongside technology. "We can find a lot of people around the digital space to work with in that area. Ten years ago it was hard. Now there's a lot more going on."</p>

      <h3>Will Free Broadband Make A Difference?</h3>
      <p>Broadband internet has clearly helped certain businesses outside of the south east and has therefore been a key debate in British politics for years. Last month the ruling Conservative Party said they would bring full-fibre broadband to every home in the country.</p>
      <p>On Friday, however, the Labour Party went further, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2019/11/14/britains-labour-party-pledges-free-broadband-for-every-home-and-business-in-the-uk/#36c7ef716e31">announcing free broadband internet to all homes and businesses</a> if it wins the general election on December 12. The plan would help businesses thrive in rural and coastal areas, said John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor.</p>
      <p>Labour's model is based on South Korea, McDonnell said. A national broadband scheme has helped connect 95.1% of the population with the world's fastest internet connection.</p>
      <p>However, this will not guarantee the spread of wealth in the U.K. One of the only other developed countries with such a high concentration of wealth is, according to Andrew Amoils who compiled the New World Wealth figures, Seoul in South Korea.</p>
