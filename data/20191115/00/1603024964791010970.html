      <p><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/hospitals-medical-services/fortishealthcare/FH">Fortis Healthcare</a> share price declined 17 percent intraday after touching 52-week high of Rs 161 in the morning trade on November 15 following a Supreme Court order in favour of its subsidiary Escort Heart Institute &amp; Research Centre Limited (EHIRCL).</p>
      <p>The court quashed the proceedings for eviction of EHIRCL from its premises in Delhi’s Okhla, the company told the exchanges.</p>
      <p>EHIRCL had moved the Delhi High Court after the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in 2005 terminated the lease of the hospital.</p>

      </p>
      <p>EHIRCL writ petition was dismissed by a single judge bench in 2006. EHIRCL then unsuccessfully sought relief from a two-judge bench following which it filed a special leave petition in the top court.</p>
      <p>The matter came up for final hearing on November 15, when the court quashed the eviction proceedings.</p>
      <p>The copy of the judgment was awaited, the company said.</p>
      <p>At 1130 hours, Fortis Healthcare was quoting at Rs 137.55, down Rs 18.55, or 11.88 percent, on the BSE.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
