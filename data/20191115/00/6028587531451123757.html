      <p><b><i>Google Wants To Be Your Banker</i></b>Google plans to launch a checking account aimed at individuals as soon as next year. The search giant will tie the accounts to its Google Pay offering, which already has 100 million users around the globe. Google is partnering with Citigroup and a San Francisco University credit union to offer the accounts. That means the accounts will likely carry fees. Google's move into checking comes at a time when other Big Tech companies like Apple and Facebook are looking to dive deeper into consumer banking and financial services.

          <i>Hackers Are Stealing Loyalty Rewards. Are Your Air Miles Or Hotel Points At Risk?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>American consumers love loyalty programs. It's estimated that the 3.3 billion loyalty program members in the U.S. currently store about $48 billion worth of points and miles in their accounts. These programs are an inviting target for hackers. While we call them <a href="https://www.lowcards.com/airline-credit-cards/">miles</a> or <a href="https://www.lowcards.com/points/">points</a>, loyalty rewards are really a form of digital currency that can be used just like cash. Because they're so liquid, the hackers don't have to book flights or hotel stays. They can buy gift cards or merchandise to resell online, or they can simply sell the stolen rewards to other criminals.

      <p>The way your company could get hacked might surprise you. The personal data of entire nations is up for grabsâ€”literally: Ecuador, Bulgaria.

      </p>
      <p>Not all financing, particularly when it comes to deferred interest, works the way you'd expect. If someone tells you that an <a href="https://www.lowcards.com/low-intro-rate-cards/">interest-free introductory offer</a> is good for three months or six months, you might reasonably expect that you'd pay absolutely no interest during that time frame. You'd never expect that some slip-up suddenly could change all the rules when it comes to deferred interest so that you never get any break from the start. Roughly eight in 10 consumers do not understand how deferred interest actually works.

      </p>
      <p>Visa and Mastercard are once again in the crosshairs of U.S. antitrust regulators over policies that can prohibit merchants from routing card transactions over alternative debit networks. At issue is whether Visa and Mastercard and large debit card issuers are blocking retailers from routing some mobile wallet payments and tap-to-pay transactions over alternative networks such as Pulse, NYCE and Star.

          <i>The War on Cash May Already Be Over</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Cash is no longer king. U.S. consumers are significantly more likely to use credit or debit cards than they are to use cash when making a purchase. In fact, more than 70% of them are most likely to pull out either a credit or debit card for a personal purchase, compared to 23.8% who are most apt to use cash, according to a new survey from Business.org. Safety concerns may be the primary thing keeping cash in the game. [<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/13/the-war-on-cash-may-already-be-over.aspx">The Motley Fool</a>]</p>

      <p>A string of viral tweets blasting Apple's new credit card for alleged gender discrimination has led to an investigation from New York's Department of Financial Services.

      <p>The dispute process is a crucial component of the credit card industry. When a consumer disputes a transaction, believing it to be fraudulent, the card issuer and merchant must resolve who is financially liable for the purchase. In response to the forecasted increase in disputes, Visa and Mastercard have implemented changes to their respective dispute processes.

          <i>California Replaces Paper Checks With Debit Cards To Ease Shopping, Reduce Stigma, In Government-Funded Nutrition Program</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>California residents who receive money for food through the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program are now getting electronic cards instead of the cumbersome paper vouchers. The federal program, better known by the acronym WIC, helps feed more than 1 million people statewide, most of them children. Modernization is expected to make the benefit more efficient and easier to use and less embarrassing. The hope is that the cards also will encourage more participation from people who need the help and retailers who accept WIC payments.
