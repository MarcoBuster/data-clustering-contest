      <p>A melee marred the end of Thursday's NFL game that saw the Cleveland Browns defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-7, in a battle between two traditional rivals.</p>
      <p>With just eight seconds remaining, Browns defender Myles Garrett ripped the helmet off of Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph. Garrett then used the helmet to strike Rudolph.</p>
      <p>This came as players from both the Browns and Steelers were exchanging punches and shoves.</p>
      <p>The incident began when Rudolph made a short pass while Garrett was attempting a sack. As the two players were on the ground, it appeared Rudolph may have been either trying to remove Garrett's helmet, or had his hand stuck in Garrett's helmet. Then Garrett pulled Rudolph's lid off, and Rudolph responded by getting into a shoving match with Garrett. That is when Garrett struck Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.</p>
      <p>In a postgame interview with Fox Sports' Erin Andrews, Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield called Garrett's actions inexcusable, and predicted that Garrett would be suspended.</p>
      <p>"I don't care rivalry or not, we can't do that," Mayfield said. "That is just endangering the other team."</p>
      <p>Garrett himself called his actions "foolish."</p>
      <p>"I shouldn't allow myself to slip like that. It's out of character," Garrett said.</p>
