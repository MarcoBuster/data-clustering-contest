        <b>Lionel Scaloni was elated with the attitude shown by Argentina as they beat Brazil 1-0 in Riyadh on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni lauded the attitude of his players who he feels "<b>gave their lives for the shirt</b>" in Friday's 1-0 win over bitter rivals Brazil.</p>
      <p><b>Lionel Messi was back in the team for the first time </b>since the Copa America after serving a four-match ban for accusing CONMEBOL of corruption.</p>
      <p>He scored the <b>decisive goal early</b> on when pouncing on the rebound after seeing Alisson save his penalty a few moments after Gabriel Jesus had also failed to convert from 12 yards.</p>
      <p>Otherwise it was a scrappy and disjointed affair, though Argentina looked considerably more <b>threatening in the final third </b>and were unfortunate to not add to the score in the second half.</p>

      <p>Despite Argentina's wastefulness after the interval, <b>Scaloni was left overjoyed</b> with the mentality and attitude of his team.</p>
      <p>"I liked the second half," Scaloni told reporters. "We made changes because we wanted to test for what is to come. The team responded –<b> it goes beyond who plays.</b> They give their lives for the shirt and really played well."</p>

      <p><b>Argentina remain unbeaten in their five post-Copa America matches</b>, while Brazil – who have also played five times since lifting the trophy – are winless in that period.</p>
