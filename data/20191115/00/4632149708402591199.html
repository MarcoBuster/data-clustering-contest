      <p><i>BMTC trains 11 women under Nirbhaya scheme to drive light motor vehicles</i> <br/><br/>Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has successfully trained 11 orphan girls under its Nirbhaya scheme as drivers of light motor vehicles. On Thursday, the 11 girls from Raichur district passed the driving license test at the Nelamangala Regional Transport Office (RTO). <br/><br/>The program had first started in August 2018. BMTC does not ensure employment after the completion of the program. Though a number of women have been trained in the program, BMTC still has only one woman driver cum conductor in its corporation. BMTC officials inform that soon 400 more women will be trained under the program as LMV drivers. In LMV program, women are trained to drive vehicles like Bolero, Maruti Dezire, etc. <br/><br/>Initially, BMTC’s Nirbhaya scheme’s women drivers had started on a slow note with few takers for the program. In 2018, BMTC had earmarked Rs 7.5 crore funds under the Nirbhaya scheme to train 1000 women in driving buses and light motor vehicles. Officials say that most women prefer to be trained in light motor vehicles. Once trained in driving light motor vehicles, one becomes eligible to apply for training in heavy passengers vehicles. <br/><br/>A senior BMTC official informs, “BMTC Training Centre has been giving training to in car, bus and jeep driving for both women and men for free. For the former it is under the Nirbhaya scheme and for the latter it is under the Kaushalya/ST Welfare/SCSP/TSP schemes. We complete the training programs in 30 days. Any woman above 21 years of age is eligible to apply for light motor vehicle (LMVs) training program. After the training completes, the driving license is issued. For heavy passenger vehicles (HPVs) like buses, women have to complete 24 years of age. Once they have completed the LMV training course, they are eligible to apply for training in HPV.” <br/><br/>One can apply at the Shanthinagar Traffic and Transit Management Centre (TTMC) of BMTC. BMTC trains free of cost for a month with facilities for accommodation at its centre.</p>
