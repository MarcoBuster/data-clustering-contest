      <h1>Huawei Mate X goes on sale, stock depletes in minutes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=32" target="_blank">Yordan</a></address>
      <p>Huawei introduced the foldable <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_x-9605.php">Mate X</a> back in March, but we had to wait until October for the device to arrive for sale. Back on October 23, it was up for registration/pre-order in China, and today it appeared for its first flash sale.</p>
      <p>Well, Huawei either underestimated the demand or just stocked very few devices, because all units sold out in a matter of minutes. On the upside there's another flash sale scheduled for November 22.</p>

      <p>The phone has a foldable 8” OLED that transforms to a dual smartphone when folded - 6.6” on the front and 6.38” with an extremely tall ratio on the back, right next to the cameras and the power button.</p>
      <p>Huawei is selling the Mate X with the year-old Kirin 980 chipset, coupled with an in-house 5G modem. It has 8 GB RAM and 512 gigs of storage, with 256 GB more available, if you use the proprietary NM memory card.</p>

      <p>An impressive interesting spec is the 55W fast-charging, which was fastest in the world at the time of the announcement, but even that feature got surpassed by the competition now.</p>
      <p>If you are still willing to purchase the phone, you should know it keeps its mind-boggling price of CNY16,999, which translates to roughly $2,400 or €2,200.</p>
