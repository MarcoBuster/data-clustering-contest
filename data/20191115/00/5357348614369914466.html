        <b>STATE minister Floyd Green says the new Patents and Designs Bill will be tabled in Parliament this month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Green, state minister in the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, says he recently went to the final sitting of the Legislative Committee of Cabinet where they signed off on the final amendments, and now the Bill is ready to go before Parliament.</p>
      <p>“With this new Bill, Jamaica will have one of the most modern patent systems in the entire region,” the minister stated. “The Government has to provide the framework for local brands to be protected and this is why we are working to enhance that framework, hence my commitment and drive to see this new Bill brought to fruition in the shortest possible order.”</p>
      <p>The junior minister was speaking at the opening of this week's three-day regional seminar spearheaded by Jamaica Intellectual Property Office (JIPO), in partnership with World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and Jamaica Manufacturers and Exporters Association (JMEA) to explore the use of intellectual property to enhance export opportunities, at the Courtleigh Hotel &amp; Suites in Kingston.</p>
      <p>Minister Green said the next step is to ensure a more robust educational drive to assist Jamaicans in understanding and appreciating the need to protect their ideas, and he invited the JMEA to partner with the Government to develop this educational campaign.</p>
      <p>The new Patents and Designs Bill will take Jamaica up to the current world standards in intellectual property (IP) rights, said Green.</p>
      <p>He also spoke to export opportunities with the use of IP, saying he supports WIPO's stance that IP rights, especially trademarks and industrial designs, may help people to develop an advantageous market position in export markets and enhance the opportunity of winning loyal clientèle for products and services in export markets.</p>
      <p>“In our rapidly developing global economy, IP is essential in fostering and bolstering creativity, originality, innovation and competitiveness. So, it is important to protect and boost your intellectual property internationally,” the minister declared.</p>
      <p>He added: “Exporting broadens the horizons for creators and enhances the growth of the local economy. So, the onus is on us is to explore these opportunities, educate and encourage the public to continue creating and keep innovating because we can, as a country and as a region, dominate the global space.”</p>
      <p>At the same time, Minister Green said that JIPO is finished with the amendments needed for the Madrid Protocol. These amendments will go before the Legislative Committee next, and then quickly after, be brought before Parliament. He said these changes will be made to the Trade Marks Act that accepts the Madrid Protocol.</p>
      <p>The Madrid Protocol is an international system for obtaining trade mark protection for a number of countries and/or regions using a single application. Protection (an international registration) can only be obtained for countries and regions which have joined the system.</p>
