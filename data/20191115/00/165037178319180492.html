        <b>Fabian is on the agenda of many European teams. Without going any further, Madrid has sounded like a possible destination for the footballer. That's why Napoli have been in a hurry and have thought about armouring their star. They want to put a clause on him of 180 million euros.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Napoli's ideal situation would be to offer <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/fabian-235644">Fabian </a><b>a new contract.</b> They want to try and keep hold of him.</p>
      <p>According to 'Il Corrierre dello Sport', Napoli want to put<b> a clause of 180 million euros on him.</b> If somebody thinks about trying to get him, they will have to spend a big sum of money.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a><b> are the main team interested in his services.</b> There are those who have even already included his signing into the White team.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/napoli/">Napoli </a><b>do not want to hear about Fabian's possible exit.</b> The Italian press states that the club are working hard to convince the player to stay and, to fix a claise to keep any interested team away (in this case, Madrid).</p>
      <p>Fabian has <b>a contract with Napoli until 2023.</b>Â It will be necessary to see if he sits down to negotiate some possible improvements that entail, of course, the imposition of<b> that great rescission clause.</b></p>
