      <p>Nigeria's Supreme Court says Atiku Abubakar and the Peoples Democratic Party failed to prove their case in court.<br/><br/>The apex court said this while giving reasons on the dismissal of Abubakar's appeal against judgments of the lower courts on the presidential election petitions filed by the former vice president.<br/><br/>The court also ruled that President Muhammadu Buhari was "eminently qualified" to contest the 2019 presidential election.<br/><br/>Justice John Okoro, who read the submissions of the chief justice ofÂ Nigeria, held that the failure of the appellants to call credible witnesses was fatal to their case as they presented only five witnesses including a star witness who relied on hearsay evidence.
