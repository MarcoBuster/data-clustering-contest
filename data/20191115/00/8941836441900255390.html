      <p>The Mate X uses <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a>’s Kirin 980 and Balong 5000 chipset instead of chips from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a> or other U.S. suppliers. It comes loaded with Chinese alternatives to Google music, maps and other apps.</p>
      <p>The screen unfolds to 14.6 centimeters (5.8 inches) by 16.1 centimeters (6.4 inches).</p>
      <p>The Mate X uses <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a>’s EMUI 9 operating system, which is based on Google’s Android. The company can use the open-source version of Android but if U.S. sanctions are fully enforced, it will lose access to Google’s popular music and other apps, making it harder to compete with Samsung.</p>
      <p>American officials say companies will be allowed to sell some products to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> but they still are waiting for licenses.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> smartphones sold in China already use local music and other apps because Google services aren’t licensed by Beijing.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> unveiled a smartphone operating system, HarmonyOS, in August that it said can replace Android if necessary. The company says, however, it wants to keep working with American vendors.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> reported earlier sales rose 24.4% in the first nine months of 2019 to 610.8 billion yuan ($86 billion). Its chairman, Liang Hua, warned in July it would “face difficulties” in the second half.</p>
        <p>Also this week, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> said it would pay bonuses totaling 2 billion yuan ($285 million) to 90,000 employees in chip development and some other units as thanks for helping to cope with U.S. sanctions.</p>
        <p>The full 180,000-member workforce also will receive an extra month’s salary, the company said.</p>
