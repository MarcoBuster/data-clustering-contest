      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/kristaps-porzingis">Kristaps Porzingis</a> was showered with a torrent of verbal abuse Thursday night by Knicks fans in his first game at Madison Square Garden as an opponent, and the big fella claims he was unaffected by the boos and taunts.</p>

      <p>Per <i><a href="https://apnews.com/327ac6d599d54eb3a4978f7a5029c870">The AP</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I get it around this league,” Knicks forward Marcus Morris said, “but it was a different level.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Kristaps Porzingis couldn’t even hide from the taunts during the national anthem.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I wouldn’t say it affected me,” Porzingis said. “I heard it of course. It was pretty loud. But I tried to play my game, stay focused and not think too much about what’s going on on the outside.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Porzingis has declined to talk about what caused the deterioration of his relationship with the team, so he understood why there would be such a harsh reception.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“It’s what they know. It’s what they’ve heard,” he said. “It is what it is. We came here to win a game and we’re frustrated we didn’t get it done.”</i>
