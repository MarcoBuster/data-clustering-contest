      <p>FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) - The Atlanta Falcons will be without running back Devonta Freeman, tight end Austin Hooper and safety Kemal Ishmael for Sunday’s game at Carolina.</p>
      <p>All three were ruled out Friday. Freeman sustained a sprained foot in last weekend’s upset victory over New Orleans, while Hooper went down with a sprained knee. Ishmael won’t play against the Panthers because of a concussion.</p>
      <p>The Falcons (2-7) will have starting cornerback Desmond Trufant, who is set to play for the first time since Week 5. He’s been out with a toe injury.</p>
