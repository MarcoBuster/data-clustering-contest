      <p>NAPPANEE, Ind. (AP) - An official says northern Indiana tourist destination Amish Acres will close at the end of the year after 50 years in business.</p>
      <p>Executive Director Jeff Kitson of the Nappanee Area Chamber of Commerce said Friday he received a letter from founder and CEO Richard Pletcher saying his family is retiring at the end of 2019 and will close Amish Acres after its New Year’s fireworks show.</p>
      <p>Kitson says the business will likely go to auction in early spring if the family hasn’t found a buyer by then.</p>
