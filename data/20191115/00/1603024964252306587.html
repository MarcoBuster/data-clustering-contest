      <p>The past couple of years have been quite for HTC when it comes to smartphone launches. Earlier this year, the Taiwan-based company launched two new smartphones, the Desire 19+ and the U19e. HTC has now expanded its Desire series with the launch of the 19s in Taiwan.</p>
      <p>HTC Desire 19s is a midrange offering launched for TWD 5,990 (roughly Rs 14,200). The smartphone features a 6.2-inch HD+ display with a 720 x 1520 resolution. It has a 19:9 aspect ratio and a water-drop notch on the top of the display for the front camera.</p>
      <p>A MediaTek Helio P22 SoC handles the processing under the hood with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal memory. Storage can be further expanded via a microSD card. The Desire 19s comes packed with a fairly-large 3,850 mAh battery that can be charged via a USB Type-C cable.</p>
