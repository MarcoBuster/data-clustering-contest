      <p>There’s no question that the folks around the Magic have endured some early-season disappointment through the first month of the season. Orlando came into the season mindful of its 22-9 finish to last year and hopeful that the momentum of the spring of 2019 could be carried here into the fall. Point guard D.J. Augustin, heading into this season, credited coach Steve Clifford with the strong finish to 2018-19. “We have schemes, we have everything he tells us to do and it’s a matter of us doing it as a group,” Augustin said last month. “That’s what we decided to do right around the All-Star break, and we saw the results. If we start off how we finished last season, we can do great things.”</p>
      <p>The Magic are doing those things—defensively. But they’ve been woeful offensively and that’s led to speculation that Orlando is considering making major changes. As <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/11/13/20962320/san-antonio-spurs-demar-derozan-popovich-trade-style">the Ringer reported</a>, Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan, expected to be a free agent this summer, is a potential trade target.</p>
      <p>A source with knowledge of the team’s thinking, though, says that a move is still a long way off.</p>
      <p>“There has not been the same punch offensively, that is obvious,” the source said. “But you’ve got a lot of players dealing with some shooting slumps and that is going to turn around, those players are going to get back to their usual percentages. So everyone does due diligence on the market but it doesn’t seem like anything is about to come down. If you make a move now with the offense at a low point, it’s like you’re selling low. See who comes back, who bounces back. Then go from there. It’s far away and a lot can change.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Magic have been in a terrible slump as a group. They’re shooting 28.5 percent from the 3-point line, which is not just last in the league, it is last by a wide margin—the Hawks rank 29<sup>th</sup>, at 30.1 percent. Orlando would need to make 34 straight 3-pointers just to get to the league average (34.9 percent).</p>
      <p>But things are improving. After failing to break the 100-point mark in their first seven games, the Magic have done it four straight times, including 112 points in a win over the Sixers, the No. 7 defense in the league. The Magic had their best 3-point shooting night in a tough loss to Indiana, in which they made 15 3-pointers. Orlando has made 36.8 percent of its 3s in the past two games.</p>
      <h3>DeRozan Or Russell To The Rescue?</h3>
      <p>Don’t expect an overreaction to the slow shooting start. The defense has been very good and the offense can’t possibly remain so bad.</p>
      <p>A deal for DeRozan would give the Magic a go-to scorer. But with DeRozan heading into free agency, the Magic would be reluctant to give up too much for him. There has been talk that DeRozan would prefer to return to the Eastern Conference but the Magic will have no guarantee that he would stay in Orlando.</p>
      <p>If the deal costs Orlando a first-round pick and, say, Mo Bamba—who has struggled in his first two years of development—along with Evan Fournier, that’s a steep price for what may be a short-term fix.</p>
      <p>The Magic could give up forward Aaron Gordon, because there are concerns that he might not fit well over the long term with forward Jonathan Isaac, but Orlando won’t trade away Gordon for a few months of renting DeRozan, who is hardly the guy to help fix the Magic’s 3-point shooting troubles. <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/derozde01.html">DeRozan has only taken four 3-pointers </a>this season and missed all of them.</p>
      <p>Besides, DeRozan is only one of many trade options for the Magic. The team also <a href="https://theathletic.com/1006765/2019/06/04/charanias-inside-pass-all-eyes-on-davis-and-pelicans-future-as-their-talks-begin-to-take-shape-plus-more-league-notes/">considered guard D’Angelo Russell </a>when he was a restricted free agent this summer, though Orlando never got serious about signing or working out a sign-and-trade with Brooklyn for him. The Magic have the young pieces and draft picks to make a move for Russell, who is averaging 25.7 points and is under contract through 2022-23.    </p>
      <h3>‘Give The Young Guys Time’</h3>
      <p>The Magic are still banking on improvement from within. They’re being patient with two young players who have shown some signs of offensive improvement—point guard Markelle Fultz and Isaac. The Magic believe Isaac is just scratching the surface of his offensive potential and while comparisons to Pascal Siakam are overblown, he could be a guy who contributes 16-18 points per game while excelling defensively.</p>
      <p>Fultz <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/fultzma01.html">has not fixed his shooting </a>yet, of course, and is 1-for-11 from the 3-point line in his last eight games. But he’s been good from midrange (47.4 percent) and has cleaned up his free-throw shooting (75.0 percent after making 53.4 percent in his first two seasons), an indication that he could solidify his 3-point shooting over time, too.</p>
      <p>Patience is still a buzzword for the Magic. “It takes a couple years for those guys to adjust to the NBA game and the style of play,” Augustin said. “I think today’s media and social media and stuff like that, they put too much pressure on these guys when they get drafted. It takes a few years for people to understand the game. Give the young guys time. I’ve been in the league 12 years and I am just getting it down.”</p>
      <p>Still there is only one guy in the Orlando rotation who can create his own shots, and that’s sixth man Terrence Ross. After signing a four-year, $54 million deal this summer, <a href="https://theathletic.com/1347519/2019/11/04/orlando-magic-terrence-ross/">Ross was under pressure </a>from the start of the year and struggled. He sat out two games with a sore right knee—that could be an ongoing concern—but has scored 12 and 13 points in the two games since he has returned.</p>
      <p>Ross is shooting 33.0 percent and his 24.5 percent shooting from the 3-point line is third-worst in the NBA for players shooting more than five per game. He’s a career 37.1 percent 3-point shooter, though. He’s not going to remain as bad as he has been so far.</p>
      <p>The Magic’s offensive problems are real, but the depth of the team’s scoring trouble was overblown in the early going. They’ve been better lately and that will continue. No doubt, they need a reliable scorer, but this team is still far away from figuring out whom that scorer might be and whether it’s worth it to cough up assets to get him.</p>
