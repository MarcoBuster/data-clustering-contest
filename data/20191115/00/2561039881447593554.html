      <p>Apple has stopped signing iOS 13.2, preventing users from being able to downgrade or restore to that firmware version.<br/><br/>Currently, Apple's latest firmware is <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/73169/apple-releases-ios-1322-to-fix-issue-that-caused-backgrounded-apps-to-unexpectedly-quit-download">iOS 13.2.2</a>. If you accidentally update or restore, you'll find yourself on that version. Developers have been seeded with <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/73234/apple-releases-ios-133-beta-2-download">iOS 13.3</a>.<br/><br/>Those interested in jailbreaking are typically advised to stay on the lowest firmware possible; however, the recently released <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/73264/checkra1n-jailbreak-updated-with-significant-improvements">checkra1n jailbreak</a> makes it possible to jailbreak <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/73196/checkra1n-jailbreak-beta-released">most devices</a> between the iPhone 5s and iPhone X on any firmware version above iOS 12.3.<br/><br/>Please <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iclarified/id388040325">download the iClarified app</a> or follow iClarified on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/iclarified"><b>Twitter</b></a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iclarified"><b>Facebook</b></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/iclarified"><b>YouTube</b></a>, and <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/rss/rss.xml"><b>RSS</b></a> for updates.</p>
