      <p>For nearly 11 months after a 50-year-old man raped and killed a four-year-old boy, he played at being a sympathiser of the child’s parents. He even accompanied them as their translator, even as the police were investigating the case. <br/><br/>Finally on Wednesday, the investigation unmasked the heinous criminal, Narada Bhagat, a native of Bihar, who works as a loader in and around ITPL area. Bhagat had managed to hoodwink the authorities as he was close to the victim’s family. <br/><br/>The police, on their part, were on the lookout for a paedophile and did not suspect Bhagat at all. <br/><br/>On January 1, Bhagat had lured the boy with chocolates and taken him to a eucalyptus grove, about 300 metres from the child’s house in Anugondanahalli. While raping the child, Bhagat gagged him so that he would not scream for help and the boy died of suffocation. Bhagat looked around to make sure nobody had seen him and left the body in the grove and returned to his house. <br/><br/>Bhagat was aware of what was happening at the child’s house as they were neighbours. The boys’ parents searched for him for two days and then on January 3 around 7.30 am, they found their son’s decomposed body in the grove and filed a complaint with the police. <br/><br/>On the same day, the police registered a case of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sent the body for post-mortem. <br/><br/>“The post-mortem report indicated that the boy had been sexually assaulted before the murder. The family of the victim, who is also from Bihar, was close to the accused. Since they had difficulty in filing the complaint and communicating with the police as they did not know the local language, Bhagat stepped in to help them. The accused has been living in the city for the last 25 years and is well-versed in the local language and he made full use of this fact,” said a police official.</p>

      <p>–A police official<br/><br/><br/>Bhagat became the translator for the parents of the child and helped them with all communication with the police. “This indeed worked in his favour as the needle of suspicion was never pointing at him,” the officer added. <br/><br/><b>Investigation</b> <br/><br/>The police then had to deal with the tedious task of tracing the accused, as there were no clues available at the crime scene. The police worked at gaining the confidence of people from Bihar and other North Indian states, who were living and working in their jurisdiction. Through their informants, the police gradually got to know that there was one particular drug peddler, who would supply ganja to addicts and in return did not take money from them, but forced them to sleep with him. The police assumed that this could be the man they were looking for. <br/><br/>“The informants did not know that Bhagat was the drug peddler. The police started looking out for drug addicts and upon questioning some of them, they confessed that Bhagat had forced them to sleep with him. We were shocked to know that this was the same man who was helping with the translation,” the officer added. <br/><br/><br/>Bhagat was picked up for questioning and he confessed to having raped the boy and killing him. He also claimed that he had physical relationships with a few other men. The details of all his victims are yet to be ascertained. <br/><br/>“Bhagat has been remanded to judicial custody. His wife had died around 22 years back. His son and daughter stay in Bihar. The accused has been staying alone in the city,” the officer added. <br/><br/><br/>The Anugondanahalli police have registered a case.</p>
