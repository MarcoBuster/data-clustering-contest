      <p>Agent Alex Moloney had this two-bedroom suite cleaned, painted and staged, but still expected it would face stiff competition with more renovated – or newer – counterparts around Berczy Park. Its initial asking price of $869,000 was cut to $849,000, which spurred a formal purchase agreement for $820,000 in early August.</p>
      <p>“This is about $550 per square foot, and the average price in a newer building nowadays in that area is going to be at least $1,000 or $1,100 a square foot, so double the price nearly,” Mr. Moloney said.</p>
      <p>“So this is – for someone who wants a good price point per square foot – a large condo, [if they are] willing to take on some work.”</p>
      <h4>What they got</h4>

      <p>This nearly 40-year-old suite provides 1,500 square feet of living space bound by full-height windows throughout, including the updated eat-in kitchen and solarium. The latter also shares a glass wall with the open living and dining area.</p>
      <p>Two full bathrooms and laundry facilities complete the unit. Plus, it has a parking spot.</p>
      <p>Monthly fees of $1,385 pay for heating, water and cable, as well as 24-hour concierge, gym, pool and recreation room.</p>
      <h4>The agent’s take</h4>

      <p>“Fifteen hundred square feet is definitely a larger condo. Most condos are an average of 700 to 800 square feet,” Mr. Moloney said.</p>
      <p>“[And] it’s located across from Berczy Park, and close to Yonge Street, the subway and the Financial District.”</p>
