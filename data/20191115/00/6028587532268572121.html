      <p>The MTA could learn something about consistency from the crowd at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night. The boos came like clockwork every time Kristaps Porzingis touched the ball. It was his first appearance in New York since a blockbuster trade sent him from the Knicks to the Dallas Mavericks in January. The taunts only grew louder as the game came down to the final seconds. At the final buzzer, the crowd got what it came to see: Porzingis lose.For the second time in less than a week, the Mavericks fell to the lowly Knicks, 106-103. New York’s win on Thursday certainly energized the entire Knicks fanbase. The Garden had the feel of a playoff game throughout the night. Given the turmoil currently engulfing the Knicks, the fans and organization needed a distraction like this.</p>
      <p>Coming into the night, Porzingis didn’t know exactly what to expect from the fans in the Mecca. He knew they would vocal and that there would be a lot of energy in the building. At the very least, he knew that it would be a night to remember.  </p>
      <p>“Probably a lot of noise,” Porzingis said, predicting the crowd’s reaction. “I don’t know if it’s going to be positive or negative, but there’s going to be a lot of emotion, I think, from the fans and from me also, you know, coming back to New York. It’s going to be interesting. I’m looking forward to the game. I spent there four years of my life living there and stuff. It’s going to be special coming back to New York for sure.”</p>
      <p>He got more than he bargained for as he walked off the court to chants of “KP sucks.” Porzingis and the Knicks didn’t part on the best terms. He asked to be traded last season, with the intent of going to an organization that was moving in a positive direction. The Knicks are the antithesis of that. Then the Mavericks picked up the phone. Soon after the two sides completed the deal, negative rumors surfaced, likely leaked by team personnel, about Porzingis and how he conducted himself with the Knicks. It left a bitter taste in everyone's mouth. Based on the crowd’s reaction last night, there’s still a lot of animosity in the air.   </p>
      <p>As the jeers poured down from the stands at the Garden, Porzingis was able to put together a good game, although he couldn’t find the range from deep. He posted a double double, scoring 20 points and pulling down 11 rebounds to go along with three blocks. There were moments when he silenced the crowd as well. With time running down in the third quarter, Porzingis had a put back slam dunk that tied the game at 87. Those moments were few and far between, though.</p>
      <p>This season hasn’t been particularly easy for Porzingis. He's still working his way back from the ACL tear that sidelined him for 20 months. Despite that, he’s a team leader in most statistical categories, averaging 18.5 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.5 blocks. He played arguably one of his best games of the season against the Knicks in Dallas last Friday. Even though the Mavericks lost 106-102, it was a confidence booster for Porzingis. After a long postgame interview last Wednesday, where he expressed how he wasn’t playing up to the standards he sets for himself, he rattled off 28 points, nine rebounds and five blocks against New York.</p>
      <p>That’s the type of production the Mavericks hope to get from him on a regular basis. Dallas sees Porzingis as a cornerstone for the franchise alongside rising star Luka Doncic. They signed Porzingis to a five-year extension this summer to the tune of $158 million. He’s still a work in progress, but he’s showing flashes of the All-Star he once was, even if he isn’t doing so consistently.</p>
      <p>Porzingis is playing OK, but not great. He will likely settle into his role—and more importantly, his body—as more time passes and he becomes better acquainted with his teammates. The loss to the Knicks at the Garden will sting for a bit, but neither he nor the Mavs can dwell on it for long. What’s important now is to stop the backwards skid the team finds itself on, having lost three of the last four games. The last thing the Mavericks and Porzingis need is for the boo birds to follow them home to Dallas. </p>
