      <p>Taylor Swift has accused the head of her former record label and a prominent music industry figure of “exercising tyrannical control” over her career, in a row over her old music.</p>
      <p>In an extraordinary statement, Swift alleged Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun are blocking her from performing a medley of her songs at the American Music Awards (AMAs), where she will be named artist of the decade later this month.</p>
      <p>Borchetta founded Big Machine Label Group, which signed Swift as a teenager.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year it emerged Braun, who manages high-profile pop stars including Justin Bieber, had acquired Swift’s back catalogue.</p>
      <p>At the time she  said she was “sad” and “grossed out” at the move. Swift has now shared a statement on her social media accounts, saying the two men are preventing her from performing  her old songs at the AMAs as it would constitute “re-recording them before I’m allowed to next year”.</p>
      <p>Swift also announced Netflix has created a documentary about “my life for the past few years”.</p>
      <p>Borchetta and Scooter have declined the use of her older music or performance footage for the project, she alleges.</p>

      <p>Swift also claims Borchetta told her team they will allow her to use her music if she agrees not to re-record copycat versions of her songs next year and “stop talking” about him and Braun.</p>
      <p>Swift said she is legally allowed to re-record her old songs and is “looking forward” to it.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old said: “I feel very strongly that sharing what is happening to me could change the awareness level for other artists and potentially help them avoid a similar fate.</p>
      <p>“The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you’ll be punished.</p>
      <p>“This is WRONG. Neither of these men had a hand in the writing of those songs. They did nothing to create the relationship I have with my fans.”</p>

      <p>Swift then asked her fans for “help”, by letting Braun and Borchetta “know how you feel about this”.</p>
      <p>She said Braun “manages several artists who I really believe care about other artists and their work”.</p>
      <p>Swift added: “Please ask them for help with this – I’m hoping that maybe they can talk some sense into the men who are exercising tyrannical control over someone who just wants to play the music she wrote.”</p>
      <p>She then named The Carlyle Group, saying they put up the money for the sale of her music.</p>
      <p>Swift added: “I just want to be able to perform MY OWN music. That’s it. I’ve tried to work this out privately though my team but have not been able to resolve anything.</p>
      <p>“Right now my performance at the AMA’s, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November of 2020 are a question mark.”</p>
      <p>She finished the post by writing: “I love you guys and I thought you should know what’s been going on.”</p>
      <p>Pop star Halsey later backed Swift, saying her treatment is “punishment”.</p>
      <p>Writing on Instagram, she said: “These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear.</p>
      <p>“Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over reacting, You’re barking up the wrong tree.</p>
      <p>“It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her Artist of the Decade.”</p>

      <p>Supermodel Gigi Hadid also lent her support to Swift.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old tweeted: “Scott and Scooter, you know what the right thing to do is.</p>
      <p>“Taylor and her fans deserve to celebrate the music!!”</p>
      <p>Big Machine Label Group and Braun have been contacted for comment.</p>
