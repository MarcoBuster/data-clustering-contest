      <p>WASHINGTON — Privacy advocates who strapped cameras to their heads and walked around Capitol Hill Thursday say Amazon’s facial recognition technology successfully recognized a congressman - but also claimed to spot singer Roy Orbison, who died in 1988.</p>
      <p>The activists scanned thousands of faces Thursday inside and outside the U.S. Capitol to highlight the dangers of facial recognition surveillance and to urge lawmakers to restrict its use.</p>
      <p>They used commercially available software that Amazon has pitched to police, running it against a database of lawmakers, journalists, lobbyists - and, of course, sunglasses-favouring 1960s crooners. It recognized California Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier but misidentified other people.</p>
      <p>Amazon didn’t immediately return a request for comment Thursday.</p>
