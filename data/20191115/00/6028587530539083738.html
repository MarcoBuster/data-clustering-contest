      <p>The board of the European Investment Bank (EIB) decided on Thursday that it will no longer finance fossil fuels projects from the end of 2021. The majority voted in favor of a new energy lending policy supporting the EU plans to go climate neutral.</p>

Trans Adriatic Pipeline construction near the village of Amphitrite on the pipeline’s 40th km, out of the approximately 550 km traversing Greek territory. TAP’s longest section, it will start at Kipoi, near the country’s border with Turkey, and finish at its border with Albania, south-west of Ieropigi. The Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) will connect with the Trans Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP). TAP will be 878 kilometres in length. Its highest point will be 1,800 metres in Albania’s mountains, while its lowest will be 820 metres beneath the sea.TAP will transport natural gas from the giant Shah Deniz II field in Azerbaijan to Europe. More than 1,500 people working for the project directly in Greece. (Photo by Athanasios Gioumpasis/Getty Images)<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

      <p>As European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen said she wants the European Green Deal to become Europe's hallmark, the EIB Group will also align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The world’s largest international public bank will support €1 trillion of climate related investment in the coming years.</p>
      <p>“The EU bank has been Europe’s climate bank for many years. Today it has decided to make a quantum leap in its ambition,” said EIB President Werner Hoyer. “We will stop financing fossil fuels and we will launch the most ambitious climate investment strategy of any public financial institution anywhere.”</p>
      <p>The aim is to meet instead a 32% renewable energy share throughout the EU by 2030.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, energy efficiency will be prioritised, along with decentralised energy production, innovative energy storage, e-mobility and impactful investments to support energy transformation outside the EU.</p>
      <p>Through the Just Transition Fund, the EIB will finance up to 75% of projects such as reconversion of coal mines in states or regions with a more challenging transition path.</p>
      <p>The new policy, however, will not impact projects currently financed or under appraisal, like the Trans Adriatic Pipeline.</p>
      <p>Critics blame the European Commission itself and some member states, including Germany and Italy, that have been trying to introduce loopholes since the presentation of the first draft and finally succeeded.</p>
      <p>“With today's decision to greatly limit lending for fossil fuel projects, the EIB is taking a first step to become the EU's climate bank as promised by the European Commission's president elect Ursula von der Leyen,” Markus Trilling, finance and subsidies policy coordinator at Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, said.</p>
      <p>“However, the EU's bank will have to ensure the entire phase-out of fossil gas lending. Investing in fossil gas creates a massive carbon lock-in and thus it seriously undermines the EU's climate neutrality goal.”</p>
      <p>Similarly, the international movement 350.org welcomed the decision and added that campaigners will continue to fight against fossil gas projects.</p>
      <p>“When the world’s biggest public lender decides to largely ditch fossil fuels, financial markets across the globe will take notice: this is the beginning of the end of climate-wrecking fossil fuel finance,” said Kate Cahoon, Germany Campaigner, 350.org.</p>
      <p>“They had better take note of the growing list of pipelines, terminals and fracking wells that are scrapped thanks to local opposition and the unprecedented masses of people mobilising for climate justice.”</p>
      <p>Since 2012, the EIB provided €150 billion of finance supporting €550 billion of investment in projects that reduce emissions and help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>
      <p>EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, in charge of climate action and environment, said: “Two weeks before the United Nations climate change conference in Madrid, these decisions send an important signal to the world. Any financing that is not green will be made sustainable, according to the requirements of the Paris deal.”</p>
