      <h1>Myles Garrett suspended indefinitely for clubbing Mason Rudolph with h</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/adam-zielonka/" target="_blank">Adam Zielonka</a></address>
      <p>The NFL announced punishments for the end-of-game brawl between the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-browns/">Cleveland Browns</a> and Pittsburgh Steelers, which includes an indefinite suspension without pay for defensive end <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Myles Garrett</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>’s ban will last at least the rest of the regular season and postseason, the league said, for a minimum of six games. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> ripped Pittsburgh quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Mason Rudolph</a>’s helmet off his head and then struck him over the head with it.</p>
      <p>It marks the longest suspension for a single on-field incident in NFL history. The previous mark was a five-game ban for Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth, who removed an opponent’s helmet and stomped on his face.</p>
