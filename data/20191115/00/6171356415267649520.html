      <h1>Google's latest AI experiment FreddieMeter lets you know you'll never sing like Mr. Fahrenheit himself</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:06:09+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/mark-koegel/" target="_blank">Mark Koegel</a></address>
      <p>Freddie Mercury may no longer be with us, but his legacy continues to live on in his music, in movies, and now in a web app that judges your singing talents. FreddieMeter analyzes vocal patterns to determine how closely you can recreate the unique voice of Freddie Mercury. It then gives you a score based on your accuracy in general pitch and melody, as well as how closely your timbre matches that of Freddie Mercury's.</p>
      <p>The app uses a neural network and self-supervised pitch estimation (or <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/spice-self-supervised-pitch-estimation.html">SPICE</a>) to determine your accuracy in singing, and it does so directly on your device. Google has been <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/an-all-neural-on-device-speech.html">working</a> on getting more complicated neural network calculations to run <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/07/the-next-gen-google-assistant-will-be-super-fast-and-work-on-device-coming-to-pixels-later-this-year/">on-device</a> for <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/07/android-p-feature-spotlight-google-improves-neural-network-api-machine-learning-ai-developers/">some time now</a>, so it's always interesting to see novel uses of the technology.</p>

      <p>FreddieMeter has come out not long after the Bohemian Rhapsody music video reached 1 billion views and was released by Google's Creative Lab in collaboration with YouTube Music to support the Mercury Phoenix Fund, a charity to spread awareness for the fight against AIDS.</p>
      <p>The experiment is designed to run in your browser on desktop and mobile. You can try it out <a href="http://freddiemeter.withyoutube.com/">here</a>.</p>
