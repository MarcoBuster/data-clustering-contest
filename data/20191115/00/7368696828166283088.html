      <p>We absolutely loved The Outer Worlds from Obsidian Entertainment, showcasing how the developer has returned to top form, giving it an 8.7/10 in <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/the-outer-worlds-review-spacers-choice/">our review</a>. With Obsidian Entertainment back and better than ever, it is very exciting to hear about a new game from the studio. The game is called Grounded and it was revealed to the world at the X019 event from Microsoft last night.</p>

      <p>Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Microsoft looks unique and very interesting. As an FPS, co-op survival title, with a combination of environmental and narrative-driven storytelling, grounded will see four players being shrunk down to the size of ants and get tasked with surviving in a suburban yard.</p>
      <p>When Grounded releases in “Spring 2020” for Xbox One and PC (also on Steam). Mikey Dowling, the Director of Communications at Obsidian Entertainment, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/11/14/xbox-game-studios-and-obsidian-entertainment-announce-grounded/">explains</a> that:</p>
      <blockquote>In Grounded, players are shrunken to the size of an ant and tasked with surviving in the unique micro-world of a suburban backyard. Players must gather, craft and build bases with everyday objects found within the yard, searching for life-saving resources and living alongside giant, peaceful insects while fighting to survive massive hostile inhabitants.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Grounded provides a mix of environmental and narrative-driven storytelling. Set in a versatile, handcrafted sandbox structure it allows players to create their own experience from the ground up. Tasks that may seem approachable when human-sized become a challenge in this dangerous backyard landscape. This familiar yet fantastical world can be navigated solo or in four-person co-operative multiplayer, where players work together to complete missions or explore the intricately detailed world.</blockquote>
      <p>An exact release date was not revealed during X019 but Xbox Insiders will get a chance to play the game soon and it will be coming to PC as well as Xbox One.</p>
