      <p>It seemed inevitable that a Fortnite crossover with Star Wars would be coming eventually, though I have to admit, I figured we would see it for Rise of Skywalker, not Jedi: Fallen Order, the EA game which just launched five minutes ago.Fortnite is kicking off its Star Wars crossover with little fanfare, but the promise of more probably to come. An hour before the event, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lucas7yoshi">dataminers </a>uncovered a new skin and a new vehicle coming to the game.</p>
      <p>The vehicle is a Star Destroyer. You can’t fly it. You can barely even seen it. Right now, it’s currently hovering off the west coast of the Chapter 2 map, way up space, as seen above. It stands to reason that it may move closer as time goes on, and we might see some sort of related map event as it, I don’t know, starts blasting away at the map for some reason. This is Fortnite, we don’t really need reasons for things like that.</p>
      <p>The skin? Well, it’s about the most iconic Star Wars look you can have, a set of Imperial Stormtrooper armor. It’s the standard set, not the Clone Trooper era, nor the First Order era, just the original, and what our young Jedi is fighting in Fallen Order, I believe. The skins costs 1500 V-Bucks, and is part of the “Original Trilogy” set in the store. That seems to imply to me that there will be skins beyond the “Original Trilogy.” Please, please let me get a Hayden Christensen prequel Anakin skin. I would die. (<b>Update</b>: You can actually get the Stormtrooper skin for free if you buy Jedi: Fallen Order <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1195209445250420737">through the Epic Store</a>)</p>

      <p>We don’t really know anything about this event, because as I write this, Epic has not announced it, it’s simply happened. But at the very least, I would predict more skins, a lightsaber mining tool and for this Star Destroyer to move closer and start some trouble.</p>
      <p>I still believe we will probably also get a Rise of Skywalker crossover when that film arrives in the next month. It’s even possible that this Star Wars even could begin now and span until that film opens on December 20th, with new, rotating Star Wars skins and events every week or so. I wouldn’t put it past an Epic and Disney partnership, which has already borne a lot of fruit with two big Avengers crossovers so far.</p>
      <p>Pick up the skin if you want, but I would save some V-bucks because we don’t know what’s yet to come in this crossover, and what might be worth a purchase down the road. Stay tuned, as this is probably going to get pretty epic soon enough here.</p>
