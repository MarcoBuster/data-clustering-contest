      <p>Music composer Shekhar Ravjiani of the famous Vishal-Shekhar duo on Friday took to Twitter, claiming that a luxury hotel in the city charged him</p>
      <p>an "eggxorbitant" Rs 1,672 for three boiled eggs.</p>
      <p>It reminded many Twitter users of a similar protest by actor Rahul Bose who had to pay Rs 442 for two bananas at a hotel in Chandigarh some months ago.</p>

      <p>"Rs 1672 for 3 egg whites??? That was an Eggxorbitant meal," tweeted Ravjiani.</p>
      <p>He also shared a photograph of the bill, issued on November 14.</p>
      <p>As per the bill, the price of three Boiled Eggs was Rs 1,350, service charge was Rs 67.50 and state GST and Central GST accounted for Rs 127.58 each.</p>
      <p>"Seems like chicken are fed banana from the hotel where Rahul Bose stayed," said a witty Twitter user, replying to Ravjiani's tweet.</p>
      <p>Some commentators defended the hotel, saying customers pay for ambiance and service rather than food, while others suggested Ravjiani patronize road-side hawkers if he wanted to save money.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
