      <p>Though yoga wasn’t exactly developed to treat depression and anxiety, research has shown that for some people, it does seem to be fairly good at it. A new <a href="https://journals.lww.com/practicalpsychiatry/Abstract/2019/11000/Psychological_Function,_Iyengar_Yoga,_and_Coherent.4.aspx">study</a> from researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine, New York Medical College, and Harvard and Columbia Universities, finds that people who are assigned to take high or low “doses” of yoga that includes breath exercises have improved mental health at the end of three months.  The study was published this week in the <i>Journal of Psychiatric Practice</i>.</p>
      <p>The researchers split 32 participants with major depressive disorder into two groups: the high-dose group would take a 90-minute yoga class that included coherent breathing (a form of slow, controlled breath) three times a week, and do four 30-minute yoga sessions at home each week. The low-dose group was to take two yoga classes and do three at-home sessions. The respective treatments each lasted 12 weeks. (The study used Iyengar yoga, a variety that focuses on accuracy of physical alignments.)</p>
      <p>To measure the participants’ mental health, and any changes over time, the researchers had them fill out questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression, positive/negative emotions, and sleep quality, at the beginning of the study and every four weeks thereafter. These measures included the Positivity Self-Test, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Exercise-induced Feeling Inventory.</p>
      <p>Most of the measures improved in both groups: Positivity, tranquility, symptoms of anxiety and depression, physical exhaustion, and sleep quality all ameliorated over the 12 weeks. The improvements were more evident in the high-dose yoga group than the low-dose group, which suggests, in pharma lingo, a dose-dependent relationship.</p>
      <p>"Think of it this way, we give medications in different doses in order to enact their effects on the body to varying degrees," said author Chris Streeter in a statement. “Here, we explored the same concept, but used yoga. We call that a dosing study. Past yoga and depression studies have not really delved deeply into this.”</p>
      <p>One limitation in the study is that there was no control group, so the researchers couldn’t assess how the yoga treatments compared to participants who didn’t do yoga or who did a different kind of intervention, like exercise. Another is that the sample size (32 participants) is quite small.</p>
      <p>But another, larger <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.22967">study</a> out earlier this month found that just 35 minutes of exercise per day significantly reduced the risk of having a depressive episode in those who were at higher genetic risk of depression. Among 8,000 participants, each four-hour chunk of weekly exercise reduced the risk of a future depressive episode by 17%. Even low-intensity forms of exercise—like yoga—were effective.</p>
      <p>Yoga’s benefits, however, don’t seem to be solely derived from the physical aspects. Especially when coupled with breath exercises, yoga seems to tap into the same brain networks as meditation—and lots of research has shown that the practice affects the stress response, changes reactivity to fear, and even quiets the self-referential centers of the brain, which appear to be particularly active in people with depression and anxiety. Slow breathing alone has been shown to affect a subgroup of brain cells responsible for “calm” behavior, which may also be part of why yoga and meditation are effective for certain mental health issues.</p>
      <p>More work will probably be needed before specific doses of yoga are “prescribed” for mental health, but it can certainly be used in conjunction with other, tried-and-true treatments.</p>
      <p>"Providing evidence-based data is helpful in getting more individuals to try yoga as a strategy for improving their health and well-being,” said co-author of the new study, Marisa M. Silveri. “These data are crucial for accompanying investigations of underlying neurobiology that will help elucidate 'how' yoga works.”</p>
