      <p>Mark Sandy, a career official at the Office of Management and Budget, will testify in a closed-door session with House impeachment investigators on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sandy’s lawyer, Barbara “Biz” Van Gelder, confirmed to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/11/14/career-white-house-budget-official-expected-break-ranks-testify-impeachment-inquiry/">Washington Post</a> on Thursday that her client will cooperate with the investigation into President Donald Trump’s attempt to use military funds to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>“If he is subpoenaed, he will appear,” Van Gelder said.</p>
      <p>Sandy is scheduled to give a deposition on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Russell Vought, the OMB’s Trump-appointed leader, had adhered to the White House’s orders to not comply with the investigation and thus has refused to hand over documents pertaining to the military aid.</p>
      <p>“We’re not going to be a part of any sham process that’s designed to relitigate the last election,” he <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/office-management-budget-double-down-refusal-comply-impeachment-inquiry">said</a> in October.</p>
