      <p>Nearly 500 Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) outlets across India have been shut down since April this year to counter falling profits and as part of the company's divestment process, CNBC-TV18 reported quoting sources.</p>
      <p>The number of outlets of the coffee chain is said to have fallen from around 1,750 in Q4FY19 and 1,480 in Q1FY20 to about 1,200 to 1,300 now.</p>
      <p>The outlets across different regions are being shut down to contain falling profitability at Coffee Day Global that houses <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/food-processing/coffeedayenterprises/CDE">Coffee Day Enterprises'</a> coffee business.</p>

      <p>Nearly 280 of these outlets were shuttered by Cafe Coffee Day in Q2FY20 alone, sources added.</p>
      <p>In a BSE filing on November 13, Coffee Day Enterprises, the parent company of the CCD chain, announced a delay in the release of its second-quarter results. This, the company said, was due to the ongoing investigation into the books of the company and its subsidiaries.</p>
      <p>The company had also delayed its first-quarter results earlier in August, following the demise of founder and coffee baron VG Siddhartha.</p>
      <p>As per a regulatory filing on August 17, the company's debt at that point stood at around Rs 4,970 crore.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
