      <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Review Roundup – Best Star Wars in Years?</h1>

      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is out today worldwide and if you are wondering where all the marketing and review coverage is from SA, we are wondering the same thing. EA Games has kept this title under lock and key mainly due to the single-player story aspect of the game but also because well, EA’s reputation is dodgy at the moment and they have changed the way they approach new releases.</p>

      <p>If you were looking to check out a Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order review before you buy the game, then we have you covered. Some international media outlets published their reviews this morning which you can check out down below.</p>
      <h3>Gaming Trend – 95%</h3>
      <p>
        <i>In all, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order clocks in at roughly 20 hours to complete, but when I finished the main campaign I still had large swaths of planets to further explore. The only thing I knew is that wanted more. Not unlike their work with Titanfall 2, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order stands as one of my favourite games of 2019, and easily a front runner for Game of the Year. The force is very, very strong with this one – <a href="https://www.gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/the-force-is-strong-with-this-one-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review">Read the full review</a></i>

      <h3>IGN – 9.0</h3>
      <p>
        <i>It’s been ages since we got a great single-player Star Wars action game, but Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time. A strong cast sells a dark story while keeping things fun and loyal to Star Wars lore, and fast, challenging combat mixes with energetic platforming, decent puzzles, and diverse locations to explore for an all-around amazing game. –<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review"> Read the full review</a></i>

      <h3>Game Informer – 8.75</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Despite these numerous little problems, Respawn’s maiden voyage with Star Wars is largely a success. I couldn’t put this game down, both for the thrill of exploring and wanting to see where the story took me next. The inspirations taken from Dark Souls, Uncharted, and Metroid Prime unite to create something unique that just happens to work incredibly well for this beloved license. Like most starships in this universe, Jedi: Fallen Order could use a little polish, but the rust doesn’t hold it back from roaring with excitement. – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-turbulent-thrill-ride">Read the full review</a></i>

      <h3>Easy Allies – 9.0</h3>

      <h3>GameSpot – 8.0</h3>
      <p><i>But especially as it wears on, Fallen Order becomes perhaps the strongest conception of what playing as a Jedi Knight ought to really be like. It’s true that Fallen Order borrows liberally from other action games, but those elements work together with Respawn’s combat and environment design, and a story that finds humanity in the Force and in its characters, to hone in on what makes the world of Star Wars worthy of revisiting again and again. Even with some rough edges, Fallen Order represents one of the most compelling game additions to the Star Wars franchise in years.-</i> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-the-friends-we-/1900-6417364/">Read the full review</a></p>
