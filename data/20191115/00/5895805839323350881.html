      <p>You probably heard the business advice of “failing to plan is planning to fail.” That phrase is a misleading myth at best and actively dangerous at worst. Making plans is important, but our gut reaction is to plan for the best-case outcomes, ignoring the high likelihood that things will go wrong.</p>
      <p>A much better phrase is “failing to plan <i>for problems</i> is planning to fail.” To address the very high likelihood that problems will crop up, you need to plan for contingencies.</p>
      <p>When was the last time you saw a major planned project suffer from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_overrun">cost overrun</a>? It’s not as common as you might think for a project with a clear plan to come in at or under budget.</p>
      <p>For instance, a <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=094105095110065015005086085016108024001033030064027066098110064088068009091004005071020045051127023056111098109028070082117074107001090050083100099084103090096106120036022056002077017095112112099125000021097086123096030065116024012118077027107083126119&amp;EXT=pdf">2002 study </a>of major construction projects found that 86 percent went over budget. In turn, a <a href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf">2014 study</a> of large IT projects found that only 16.2 percent succeeded in meeting the original planned resource expenditure. Of the 83.8 percent of projects that did not, the average IT project suffered from a cost overrun of 189 percent.</p>
      <p>Such cost overruns can seriously damage your bottom line. Imagine if a serious IT project, such as implementing a new database at your organization, goes even 50 percent over budget, which is much less than the average cost overrun. You might be facing many thousands or even millions of dollars in unplanned expenses, causing you to draw on funds assigned for other purposes.</p>
      <p>Moreover, cost overruns often spiral out of control, resulting in even bigger disasters. Let’s say you draw the extra money from your cybersecurity budget. As a result, you’ve left yourself open to hackers, who successfully stole customer data, resulting in both bad PR and loss of customer trust.</p>
      <p>What explains cost overruns? They largely stem from the <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a047747.pdf">planning fallacy,</a> our intuitive <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/spirituality">belief</a> that everything will go according to plan, whether in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25676-9_8">IT projects</a> or in <a href="http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/Exploring-the-Planning-Fallacy_Why-People-Underestimate-Their-Task-Completion-Times.pdf">other areas</a> of business and life. The planning fallacy is one of many dangerous judgment errors, which are mental blind spots resulting from how our brain is wired that scholars in cognitive <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/neuroscience">neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/behavioral-economics">behavioral economics</a> call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a>. We make these mistakes not only at work but also in other life areas: for example, in our shopping choices, as revealed by a <a href="https://www.top10.com/blog/posts/survey-shows-most-customers-trust-their-gut-when-making-shopping-decisions">series</a> of <a href="https://www.top10.com/blog/posts/what-really-drives-you-to-buy-what-you-buy">studies</a> done by a <a href="https://www.top10.com/">shopping comparison website</a>.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, recent research in these fields shows how you can use <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/wise-decision-maker-movement-manifesto/">pragmatic strategies to address</a> these dangerous judgment errors, whether in your <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/nevergut/">professional life</a>, your <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/blindspots">relationships,</a> your <a href="https://www.top10.com/blog/posts/survey-shows-most-customers-trust-their-gut-when-making-shopping-decisions">shopping</a> <a href="https://www.top10.com/">choices</a>, or other <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/author-page/the-truth-seekers-handbook-a-science-based-guide/">life areas</a>.</p>
      <p>You <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/how-to-evaluate-unconscious-bias-caused-by-cognitive-biases-at-work/">need to evaluate</a> where cognitive biases are hurting you and others in your team and organization. Then, you can use structured <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/decision-making">decision-making</a> methods to <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/how-to-make-decisions-quickly/">make “good enough” daily decisions quickly</a>, more thorough ones for <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/8-step-leadership-decision-making-process-for-making-the-best-decisions/">moderately important choices</a>, and an in-depth one for <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/8-key-steps-for-effective-leadership-decision-making-to-avoid-decision-disasters/">truly major decisions</a>.</p>
      <p>Such techniques will also help you <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/8-key-steps-to-prevent-failure-in-implementing-decisions-or-in-managing-projects-and-processes/">implement your decisions well</a> and formulate truly <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/10-steps-for-strategic-planning-to-defend-your-future/">effective, long-term strategic plans</a>. In addition, you can <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/12-mental-skills-to-defeat-cognitive-biases/">develop the mental habits and skills</a> to notice cognitive biases and prevent yourself from slipping into them.</p>
      <p>For instance, we can address the planning fallacy by planning around it. Such planning involves anticipating what problems might come up and addressing them in advance by using the research-based technique of <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-to-avoid-business-disasters-with-behavioral-science/">prospective hindsight,</a> by envisioning yourself in the future looking back at potential challenges in the present. It also involves recognizing that you can’t anticipate all problems and building in a buffer of at least 40 percent of the project’s budget in additional funds. If things go better than anticipated, you can always use the money for a different purpose later.</p>
      <p>Besides this broad approach, <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/consulting">my consulting clients</a> have found three specific <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210310300177X">research-based techniques</a> effective for addressing the planning fallacy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>First, break down each project into component parts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>An IT firm struggled with a pattern of taking on projects that ended up losing money for the company. We evaluated the specific component parts of the projects that had cost overruns and found that the biggest unanticipated money drain came from permitting the client to make too many changes at the final stages of the project. As a result, the IT firm changed its process to minimize any changes at the tail end of the project.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Second, use your past experience with similar projects to inform your estimates for future projects.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A heavy equipment manufacturer had a systemic struggle with underestimating project costs. In one example, a project that was estimated to cost $2 million ended up costing $3 million. We suggested making it a requirement for project managers to use past project costs to inform future projections. Doing so resulted in much more accurate project cost estimates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Third, for projects with which you have little past experience, use an external perspective from a trusted and objective source.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A financial services firm whose CEO I coached wanted to move its headquarters after it outgrew its current building. I connected the CEO with a couple of other CEO clients who recently moved and expressed a willingness to share their experience. This experience helped the financial services CEO anticipate contingencies he didn’t previously consider, ranging from additional <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/consumer-behavior">marketing</a> expenses to print new collateral with the updated address to lost employee <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/productivity">productivity</a> due to changing schedules as a result of a different commute.</p>
      <p>If you take away one message from this article, remember that the key to addressing cost overruns is to remember that “failing to plan for problems is planning to fail.” Use this phrase as your guide to prevent cost overruns and avoid falling prey to the dangerous judgment error of planning fallacy.</p>
      <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Because we usually feel that everything is going to go according to plan, we don’t pay nearly enough <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a> to potential problems and fail to account for them in our plans. This problem is called a planning fallacy.</i>

      <p>Failure to anticipate the potential problems or the unexpected scenarios in the "plan" is planning to fail indeed. There's no concrete plan and no plan is perfect that you will not plan for disaster to come in.</p>

      <p>I agree that this phrase "failing to plan is planning to fail" is a misleading myth at best and actively dangerous at worst. Making plans is important for the effective and productive result. And to address the team or organization for planning fallacy have meetings to go over lessons learned, and make sure that you manage and record that organizational knowledge so that it isn't lost. Then use that knowledge to help with planning similar tasks in the future. Thank you for sharing this wonderful article!</p>
