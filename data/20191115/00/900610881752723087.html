      <h1>Prague airport announces $1bn expansion plan</h1>

      <p>Prague’s Václav Havel Airport has unveiled plans to almost double its capacity by 2035.</p>
      <p>It says it will invest 27 billion Czech Koruna (£900m/$1.1bn) on various projects it has divided into short, medium and long term, eventually allowing it to accommodate more than 30 million passengers a year.</p>
      <p>The international airport is currently nearing full capacity and handled 16.8 million passengers in 2018.</p>

      <p>“Short-term” developments include a new centralised security checkpoint with automated security lines, two large-capacity luggage carousels, new parking garages at Terminal 2 with electric car charging stations, a three-storey Skywalk connecting buildings and a new plaza in front of Terminal 2, with public spaces and greenery.</p>
      <p>A reconfigured aircraft stand in Terminal 1 will allow one wide-body aircraft or two narrow-bodies to be serviced, and will be equipped with a jet bridge with three departure gates.</p>

      <p>Work on a new runway should begin in 2025, three years later than previously planned, <a href="https://www.radio.cz/en/section/business/prague-airports-terminal-2-to-be-expanded-under-plans-for-huge-jump-in-passenger-numbers">according to Radio Prague International</a>. It should be in operation from 2028.</p>
      <p>The airport says it will be used “primarily for the landing of aircraft”.</p>
      <p>It will also add taxiways connecting the northern and southern parts of the airport and other infrastructure upgrades.</p>

      <p>Eventually Terminal 2 will be extended, with new piers, departure gates and bridges.</p>
      <p>Passengers will also be able to enter both terminals through one centralised security checkpoint where Terminal 2 currently is.</p>
      <p>It says its aim is to be the “first choice airport for travellers in the catchment area of the Czech Republic, southern Poland and the Czech-Saxon border region, and to be a preferred transfer hub as well.”</p>
      <p>It wants new regular connections, particularly increasing the number of long-haul destinations in Asia and North America and extending existing seasonal connections to New York, Philadelphia and Toronto to year-round service.</p>
      <p>It also plans to use land around the airport for facilities like a hotel, development centre, sports centre and medical centre for tourists, as well as a railway station.</p>
