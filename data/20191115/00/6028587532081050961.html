      <p><b>Topline:</b> Like the frenzied sports free-agency period, the past few months have seen live-streaming platforms like Microsoft’s Mixer, Google’s YouTube and Amazon’s leading Twitch sign exclusive deals with some of the most popular gaming personalities in order to eke out market share.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Tyler “Ninja” Blevins:</b> The most notable signing—and the one that set off the mad scramble for exclusive streaming deals—occurred in August when Mixer signed Twitch’s top streamer and former Halo pro, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/08/01/fortnite-star-ninja-leaves-twitch-for-mixer-with-new-microsoft-deal/#2ed3e951183a">Ninja</a>, who’s crossed over into the mainstream, appearing on Red Bull cans and shows like <i>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</i> and <i>The Masked Singer</i>.</li>
        <li><b>Nicholas “Nick Eh 30” Amyoony:</b> Later in August, Twitch seemingly responded by bringing popular YouTube <i>Fortnite </i>streamer, Nick Eh 30, and his 4.6 million followers over to its platform.</li>
        <li><b>Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek</b>: In October, Mixer nabbed another top streamer from Twitch: retired <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> pro, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2019/10/24/popular-twitch-streamer-shroud-moves-over-to-microsofts-mixer/#7361159d4b96">Shroud</a>, who had 7 million followers on Twitch and endorsements from Postmates and gaming hardware company HyperX.</li>
        <li><b>Cory “King Gothalion” Michael:</b> Mixer kept up its spending spree in October by signing King Gothalion, a streamer known primarily for Destiny and who boasted 1 million followers on Twitch.</li>
        <li><b>Offset:</b> That same month a new dark horse from former Apple designers Caffeine entered the fray by bringing Migos rapper Offset to its platform for shows that include live-streaming games.</li>
        <li><b>Jack “Courage” Dunlop</b>: YouTube, which shuttered its stand-alone Twitch competitor YouTube Gaming earlier in the year, reentered the ring in November by inking a deal with 100 Thieves’ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/05/youtube-steals-courage-from-twitch-as-the-celebrity-streamer-gold-rush-heats-up/#224a7e8794c2">Courage</a>, who had 2.1 million followers on Twitch before moving over.</li>
        <li><b>Soleil “Ewok” Wheeler</b>: Twitch lost another name in November, this time to Mixer: 14-year-old Faze Clan streamer Ewok and her quarter-million followers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key Background: </b>We're still in the early stages, and as such, these signings haven’t done much to hurt Twitch’s substantial lead as the top live-streaming platform. Researcher StreamElements said that Twitch made up 75.6% of hours watched in the third quarter of 2019. In the two months following Mixer’s signing of Ninja, it estimated Mixer's viewership moved up 0.2%, though it could be chalked up to the platform’s continuous, gradual growth rather than as a direct result of Ninja. YouTube may be the unsung winner from this competition, however. While it clearly wants to expand its live-streaming segment, as indicated by the signing of Courage, the company earns from every streamer regardless. A player like Ninja uploads 10-to-20-minute edited versions of his streams to YouTube, where he boasts 22.4 million subscribers.</p>
      <p><b>What To Watch For: </b>Ninja, Shroud and Courage are all represented by talent agency Loaded. Other streamers in their portfolio include big hitters like Tim “TimTheTatman” Betar, Jaryd “Summit1G” Lazar and Saqib “Lirik” Zahid. It’s not a stretch to assume they’re among the next few content creators to announce deals.</p>
      <p><b>Crucial Quote: </b>StreamElements CEO Doron Nir around the time Shroud signed with Mixer: “We’ve learned from Twitch that building a successful streaming platform is a long slow process, so whether or not these signings immediately move the needle in terms of hours watched should not be the litmus test for whether or not Mixer is making sound strategic moves. It could take years to see how everything plays out.”</p>
