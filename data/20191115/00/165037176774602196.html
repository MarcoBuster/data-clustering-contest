        <b>The Barcelona player Gerard Pique on 'El Partidazo de COPE', did not hesitate in replying to Sergio Ramos' complaint about having less rest before the Clasico than Barca.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>"They'll have more for the following game</b>. There are always complaints. <b>That's the way the fixture list is</b>." That was <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-pique-23560/">Pique's</a> response on radio programme "El Partidazo de COPE' to <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/sergio-ramos-23341/">Ramos</a>' comments prior to Spain's match with Malta. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> captain said in the press conference in Cadiz that <b>"the only team affected by the kick-off time is Real Madrid</b>" and that "there is still time to change it."</p>
      <p>Pique, who was clear in his comments, insisted on the issue: "<b>The match should have taken place on the scheduled date.</b> If it had been the other way around, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barca</a> would have complained.<b> Players are used to played every two or three days.</b> Everything is magnified when it comes to Barca and Real Madrid."</p>

      <p>"We did not propose the postponement of the fixture.<b> This started with Tebas who proposed playing it in Madrid </b>and that is how we have ended up at 18th December. We are not complaining," the Barca central defender added.</p>
      <p> The Barca number 3 <b>then decided to move on from the controversy</b> over having 29 hours more rest than Real prior to the Clasico at the Camp Nou.</p>
