      <h1>Realme 5s display size and resolution confirmed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=39" target="_blank">Sagar</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_5s_launch_date_november_20-news-40071.php">Realme 5s is arriving on November 20</a> and it will be sold through Flipkart. The e-commerce giant has already revealed a few specs of the Realme 5s like a 48MP quad camera and a <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_5s_specs_battery_size-news-40089.php">5,000 mAh battery</a>, Ð°nd now it has updated the landing page of the device on its site to tell us more about the display.</p>
      <p>The Realme 5s, which looks similar to the vanilla 5, will sport a 6.51" screen. It was expected to come with a 1080p resolution, but that won't be the case since it will retain the 720p resolution of the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_5-9802.php">Realme 5</a>.</p>

      <p>This will likely disappoint those who were expecting an upgrade to a Full HD display and at this point, we wonder what upgrades the Realme 5s will have over vanilla 5, other than the 48MP main camera.</p>
      <p>That said, the image included on the landing page confirms the Realme 5s will arrive in Purple color along with Blue and Red.</p>
      <p>There are five days until the announcement and hopefully we'll hear more about the device as time progresses.</p>
