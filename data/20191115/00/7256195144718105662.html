      <h3>TURDUCKEN</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I blow my body around like          the huge clump of brown hair</p>
      <p>that I once saw blowing up Cuba Street</p>
      <p>I follow its movements with interest</p>
      <p>I put a video of it on the internet</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>my favourite brag</p>
      <p>is that a groundskeeper once told me I was the whole package –</p>
      <p><i>good bants good body </i>he said</p>
      <p>he also said I was a piece of ass     and then apologised immediately –</p>
      <p>said he’d never called anyone that before     put his head in his hands</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I use up my body like bait     I keep my body in a bucket</p>
      <p>I keep a bucket by my bed</p>
      <p>once after boning a drug dealer     the drug dealer asked me</p>
      <p>to read him a bedtime story          I read him the whole of <i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i></p>
      <p>then he thanked me kindly and went to sleep</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I remember everything –</p>
      <p>it’s one of my bad habits</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I remember a nurse once tried to convert me</p>
      <p>to Christianity in a hospital bathroom</p>
      <p>just after I’d done a shit………………..job     of trying to kill myself</p>
      <p>at first I misheard her          I thought she said the thing that saved her life</p>
      <p>was <i>finding gold          </i>I laughed and laughed in her arms</p>
      <p>then I stopped and said     <i>wait</i></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I’m much better at suicide jokes than I am at dying</p>
      <p>and I’m not even that good at suicide jokes     so I may be immortal</p>
      <p>my jokes are very cheap     just like me</p>
      <p>but I can’t help it – I’m on the benefit – the sickness benefit</p>
      <p>my sense of humour is in itself     a sickness benefit          it is my right</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I suppose I’m a new bigot     in that I spread hate –</p>
      <p>but the hate that I spread is bespoke –</p>
      <p>it’s artisanal baby     bad poetry is my small business</p>
      <p>with the brand statement : <i>a little self-loathing goes a long way          </i>like</p>
      <p>don’t go for a jog            do not do     a face mask            don’t take a bath</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I put my body in a bath once</p>
      <p>I sat in the bath and ate a bag of Twisties</p>
      <p>the Twisties were orange     which is normal for Twisties</p>
      <p>the bathwater was also orange     which is not normal for bathwater</p>
      <p>but I had used an orange bath bomb     which was a way of pushing the boat out</p>
      <p>my body is a boat     no</p>
      <p>my body is a car in the sea with a drowned thing inside</p>
      <p>and they talk about bodies of water</p>
      <p>and they talk about the body of a car</p>
      <p>my body is a car in the sea with a drowned thing inside</p>
      <p>my body’s in a body and a body’s in me</p>
      <p>do I need to say it………………..turducken</p>
      <p>no     I did not need to say it</p>
      <p>my body is a car with a drowned thing inside</p>
      <p>pulled up and away from the sucking sea floor by a crane</p>
      <p>my body is unswallowed and dangling above the water</p>
      <p>dripping orange drips</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I remember everything</p>
      <p>but my body always tells it wrong</p>
      <p>which is a terrible betrayal :</p>
      <p>the nurse said I was lying when I said she had tried</p>
      <p>to sell god to me in the bathroom</p>
      <p>I wasn’t</p>
      <p>but my body was too tired to convince anyone</p>
      <p> </p>
