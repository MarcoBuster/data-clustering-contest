      <p>Three security officers are being investigated by the police for allegedly robbing small scale mining firms in the Ashanti Region.</p>
      <p>They were arrested on Wednesday, November 6, 2019 at Koniyaw, a community near the Bekwai Municipality —about an hour drive from the regional capital, Kumasi.</p>
      <p>They have been named as Staff Sargent Francis Kwame Boateng and L/Cpl Richard Anyimadu, both military personnel and L/Cpl Joseph Trezeguet, a prison officer at the Kumasi Central Prisons.</p>
      <p>The uniform men were arrested with six other civilians whilst trying to escape with their loot, police sources told DailyMailgh.com.</p>
      <p>Kwame Poku, a small scale miner at Koniyaw told our correspondent J. Ofori that the suspects stormed their mining site and demanded gold and money.</p>
      <p>“They took some gold, it was in a blanket, and then they continued to ask us for money,” Poku stated.</p>
      <p>After further searches, the suspected robbers left in an unregistered Ford transit driven by Agyemang Prempeh, a native of Bekwai.</p>
      <p>The victims of the robbery then alerted the police. A police patrol team was informed about the robbery incident and immediately moved to the scene and bumped into the suspects numbering about 12.</p>
      <p>Seven of the suspects managed to flee the scene whilst four of them including Sargent Francis Kwame Boateng and L/Cpl Joseph Trezeguet.</p>
      <p>While heading to the police station with the suspects, Sargent Francis Kwame Boateng managed to fall from the moving vehicle and escaped into the bush.</p>
      <p>He was later arrested together with six other suspects by some town folks at about 11pm after a search.</p>
      <p>Police retrieved 3BB Cartridges and a blanket containing the gold concentrates suspected to have been seized by the suspects.</p>
      <p>Two water pumping machines and the Ford vehicle have also been kept as exhibits by the police.</p>
      <p>Police sources at the Bekwai Divisional Police Command say the suspects had been transported to the Ashanti Regional Police Headquarters for further interrogation.</p>
      <p>The command is yet to comment on the matter as it intensifies efforts to arrest other suspects.</p>
