      <h1>LASU Adds N150,000 To Tuition For Newly Introduced Programme</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p>The Vice-Chancellor, Prof<b>. Olanrewaju Fagbohun</b> of the<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/lasu/"><u><b> Lagos State University</b></u></a>, has announced students would start paying a sum of N150,000 tuition fee for a second stream undergraduate programme.</p>
      <p>According to Fagbohun, the programme was introduced to help deepen the entrepreneurship skills of students of the institution.</p>
      <p>He said, “O<i>ur regular Stream 1 programme tuition fee is still N25,000, while medical students pay N37,000.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“But for Stream 2 entrepreneurship programme, the tuition fee is N150,000, aside from acceptance and medical fees,”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Fagbohun however, dismissed rumours that LASU had increased tuition fees for its undergraduate programmes.</p>
      <p>It is also not clear yet whether or not the second stream degree programme would be optional or mandatory for students of the university.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands that the entrepreneurship programme would run along with normal undergraduate degrees, would prepare students to be self-employed and employers of labour.</p>
      <p>The Vice-Chancellor said “<i>Research indicates that small-medium enterprises employ more than 80 per cent of the workforce in Nigeria.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“That is why we have a very close working relationship with SMEs, so they can impact on the university and impart right entrepreneurship skills to the students.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Before starting, the Stream 2 entrepreneurship programme will go through all the approval processes of the university.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Critical thing for LASU is quality assurance which means the two-stream programmes will be standard and run successfully together without any programme failing.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“We have a directorate of quality assurance that monitors every programme of the university in order to achieve best practices,”</i> the vice-chancellor said.</p>
      <p>He said that entrepreneurship courses would be taught only during the first year of the regular Stream 1 programme, while it would be taught throughout the duration of the Stream 2 programme.</p>
