      <p>A former Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Fatai Owoseni, has said that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has turned itself into a monster.</p>
      <p>The ex-Lagos CP also derided the manner the EFCC carries out its operation, saying the anti-graft agency had become a monster and the ruling government had no regard for the rule of law</p>
      <p>Owoseni, who spoke during at the 12th Annual Business Luncheon of a commercial law firm, SPA Ajibade &amp; Co. on Thursday, also said the EFCC had become a willing tool in the hands of whoever was in power.</p>
      <p>He said, “The rule of law and the application and the enforcement is interpreted based on which side of the divide you are.</p>
      <p>“If you are any of these governors today, the rule of law is something to you; if you become the Vice President today, the rule of law is another thing to you; and we are seeing it.</p>
      <p>“Depending on which side of the divide you belong, to some of us, the EFCC has become a monster.”</p>
