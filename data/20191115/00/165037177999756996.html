        <b>Pelé, a football legend, gave an interview in which, of course, he was asked by Neymar. The ex-footballer made it clear that the PSG player has not yet established himself as an important part of the Brazil squad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He did not refer to him in an offensive tone, but he did give a negative balance: "<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/neymar-64511/">Neymar </a>has not really managed to become a great figure in Brazil. People criticize him, I've even done it many times, but we forget that he's one of our products, from Santos. <b>We always want the best for him.</b> Technically, he's an excellent player.</p>
      <p>His statements were echoed by 'La Gazzetta dello Sport', where he also chose between Messi or Cristiano: "A talented player, who gives passes, centers, marks, dribbles well. If we were in the team together, our opponents would have to worry about two players. <b>Today, Messi is the most complete player."</b></p>

      <p>"In the past, it was possible to find two or three players in each country with a great football culture. We had Simon, Eusebio, Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Maradona, Garrincha or Dida. <b>How many were there? So many that it's hard to say.</b> Today we have two or three figures. <b>Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and perhaps Neymar</b>," he said.</p>
      <p>In another interview given to the agency 'EFE', he commented on Rodrygo's situation: "It's good for us because it's a good renewal. If he doesn't suffer any mishaps, as other players do, it's <b>wonderful for Brazil</b>. I talked to people who know him personally and say <b>he's a good boy</b>. I hope he's very lucky, that's good for Brazil, for Brazil's own future."</p>
