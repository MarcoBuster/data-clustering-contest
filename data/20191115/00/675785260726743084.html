      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/westlife">Westlife</a> star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nicky-byrne">Nicky Byrne</a> has admitted he didn't think Westlife could succeed again before their comeback.</p>
      <p>The Irish boyband have released new album Spectrum today - 20 years on from their self-titled debut.</p>
      <p>And after their comeback singles Hello My Love and Dynamite smashed it in the charts, Nicky has admitted he's shocked.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old exclusively told Mirror Online: "We are all proud of the new music. The reaction from the fans has been phenomenal.</p>
      <p>"If you'd have asked me when we split up if we'd have ever been in contention for the possibility of a hit album again I would have doubted it, but the success of our comeback singles such as Hello My Love has given us confidence.</p>

      <p>"This all means more to us this time around and we have all put a lot into making an album that feels fresh for today."</p>
      <p>Spectrum is the band's first album in nine years, and Nicky, Shane Filan, Mark Feehily and Kian Egan have been dying for fans to hear it.</p>
      <p>The album was co-written and produced by Westlife, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> and Steve Mac. The album follows a remarkable comeback year for the pop music treasures, which has seen the nation fall in love with them all over again.</p>
      <p>Recorded in Dublin, LA and London, Spectrum is released as Shane, Nicky, Mark and Kian make pop music history, with them officially confirmed as the biggest selling Irish band in the UK in the 21st century.</p>

      <p>The boys said: "We have all been driven by trying to create the best album of our careers. We wanted to make something current, something that feels fresh.</p>
      <p>"The huge success of our comeback single Hello My Love gave us the confidence that our fans and the public were completely up for a new album of original songs.</p>
      <p>"We’ve probably had more input into this album than any other in our careers.</p>
      <p>"Spectrum has everything we love in music and includes a mixture of great uptempo’s such as well as heartfelt ballads. We’re excited for everyone to hear it."</p>

      <p>Speaking about their collaboration with Sheeran and reunion with iconic music-maker Steve Mac, who has written some of Westlife’s biggest hits, they added: "The album has been a huge team effort and it has been fantastic to collaborate with our long term friend Steve Mac, James Bay and Ed Sheeran. There’s no doubt that they’ve helped us make this album the best it can be."</p>
      <p>Westlife announced their return to music in October 2018 when they signed a new deal with Virgin EMI.</p>
      <p>Their comeback included the success of this summer’s Twenty Tour, which sold a record 600,000 tickets across 27 cities and 13 countries.</p>
      <p>The band have also announced a stadium tour for 2020 which culminates at their first ever Wembley Stadium show on August 22.</p>
