      <h1>The favourites to succeed Robert Moreno</h1>

        <b>The Federation are happy with Roberto Moreno's work. However, according to 'Mundo Deportivo', they already have a list of possible replacements. Ernesto Valverde, Marcelino and Luis Enrique would be the RFEF's favourites.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Robert Moreno's future</b> in charge of Spain could come to an abrupt end. The coach was asked about his future in a press conference and he was blunt. <b>"They have not offered me a renewal and I won't be expecting it soon,"</b> he said.</p>
      <p>The Federation are <b>satisfied with his work</b>. Since Luis Enrique left the job, Robert Moreno took the reigns and the RFEF think that he has exceeded all expectations.</p>
      <p>But for the future, 'Mundo Deportivo' states that the Federation has other plans. <b>There are three people who are favourites to be the next Spanish team coach.</b></p>
      <p><b>Luis Enrique</b> would be one of the favourite options. He had to leave the role after the death of his daughter and the Federation has always trusted in his potential as a coach.</p>

      <p>Another of the options that would be considered, always according to the information of the media mentioned above, would be that of <b>Ernesto Valverde</b>. In this case, the Federation would only make a proposal to the him in case he leaves Barca at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Finally, they would also quite like<b> Marcelino García Toral.</b> The coach is currently without a team, after leaving Valencia.</p>
      <p>In whichever case, we must wait and see what will happen first with Robert Moreno. The national team coach is focused<b> on his work in getting Spain into the Euro 2020.</b> His future, he's made it clear, doesn't matter right now.</p>
