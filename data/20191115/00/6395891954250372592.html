      <p><b>PHILADELPHIAÂ (AP)</b> - Alshon Jeffery missed practice again Thursday because of an ankle injury, increasing the possibility Carson Wentz won't have his two top receivers when the Eagles host the New England Patriots on Sunday.</p>
      <p>DeSean Jackson had surgery for an abdominal injury last week and is out the rest of the regular season. He has played only one full game and a handful of series in two others.</p>
      <p>The Eagles (5-4) haven't had much production from their wide receivers this season. Jeffery has 34 catches for 353 yards and three touchdowns. He dropped three passes against Chicago on Nov. 3 and has looked slow.</p>
      <p>Nelson Agholor has 32 catches for 282 yards and three TDs. He also has dropped several passes, including a potential go-ahead TD in a loss at Atlanta in Week 2.</p>
      <p>Mack Hollins has 10 receptions for 125 yards despite playing 374 snaps. J.J. Arcega-Whiteside has two catches in 176 snaps.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia brought Jordan Matthews back for his third stint with the team. He could get plenty of action against the Patriots (8-1).</p>
      <p>Linebacker Nigel Bradham (ankle) and running back Darren Sproles (quadriceps) also missed practice Thursday.</p>
