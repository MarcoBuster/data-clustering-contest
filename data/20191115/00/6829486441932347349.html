      <h1>Rejoice: ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ Is Coming Back For An Eighth Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:59:19+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:59</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>

      <p>The Andy Samberg-led comedy might always have had a loyal and dedicated fanbase. But that wasn’t enough to save it when the network decided to pull the plug, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/brooklyn-nine-nine-canceled-rescued-31-hours-story.html">surreptitiously cancelling the show.</a> Of course, those fans got involved and saved the thing, but it wasn’t entirely clear that the critically-acclaimed sitcom was going to make it through to the conclusion that the creators genuinely intended.</p>
      <p>For that reason, we should get into the practice of celebrating <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine </i>literally every time we find out that it’s gotten renewed.</p>
      <p>Which is timely, cause today it’s been announced that the show will be back for an eighth season.</p>
      <p>The squad themselves reacted to the news by… Well, I mean, just watch:</p>
