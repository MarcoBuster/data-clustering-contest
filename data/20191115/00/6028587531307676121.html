      <p>At Thursday’s deadline, Jose Abreu chose to accept the White Sox $17.8 million qualifying offer, assuring fans in Chicago that he will remain for at least the 2020 season. And according to multiple reports, Abreu and his camp are still engaged in discussions with the White Sox for a multi-year extension:</p>
      <p>There is certainly room in the White Sox budget to keep Abreu around beyond the 2020 season. According to Roster Resource, their payroll next year will be just under $78 million before they make any further free agent additions. And in the future, the players set to make the largest impact on the budget will be Yoan Moncada, Lucas Giolito, and Michael Kopech as they enter arbitration in 2021 and 2022.</p>
      <p>Beyond the money, Abreu’s value to the White Sox has been sizable, both in the numbers and in the intangibles he has brought to the team.</p>
      <p>Abreu has been with the White Sox since 2014, and he has been steadily productive since joining Chicago, putting up a career .293/.349/.513 slash line with 179 home runs and over 20 WAR so far. His productivity has not particularly waned, either. In 2019, Abreu hit 33 home runs with a career-high 123 RBI. He strikes out more and walks less than he used to, but Abreu still hits doubles as steadily as anyone. His 38 doubles this season were the second-highest in his career.</p>
      <p>Abreu’s leadership on the White Sox has also been invaluable, particularly for young players like Moncada and Eloy Jimenez. And fellow Cuban Luis Robert played the last two months of the 2019 season with Triple-A Charlotte, so his arrival in the majors could arrive at some point next year, though he would have to be added to the White Sox 40-man roster first.</p>

      <p>Abreu also has a secure spot on defense at first base for a while. At some point in the future, 2019 first-rounder Andrew Vaughn will be ready to man first for Chicago, but he has just 205 professional at-bats under his belt and finished the 2019 season at High-A Winston-Salem, so it’s not imminent. If Abreu does sign something like a three-year deal, he could move to designated hitter when Vaughn – or someone else – is ready to take over at first base. Abreu started 34 games at DH in 2019.</p>
      <p>Out of the ten players who received qualifying offers on Thursday, Abreu and Twins pitcher Jake Odorizzi were the only players to accept. Former Giants reliever Will Smith rejected San Francisco’s offer and then signed with the Braves for three years, $39 million guaranteed, per The Athletic’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/1195094970840956928">Ken Rosenthal</a>. Otherwise, Madison Bumgarner, Gerrit Cole, Josh Donaldson, Marcell Ozuna, Anthony Rendon, Stephen Strasburgh, and Zack Wheeler all rejected their qualifying offers.</p>
      <p>Abreu will turn 33 in January before the 2020 season begins, so a multi-year extension could mean that he can play his entire MLB career in Chicago. Thus far, he has been consistently productive and healthy – Abreu has only two trips to the injured list since the White Sox signed him in October 2013 – so investing in him beyond 2020 makes sense for the White Sox.</p>
