      <p>The Beats By Dre team shared these special Black Friday deals with me last week. I have tested a number of these specific models personally (either via media loan last year or in various retail stores when shopping, so I have a decent sense for their quality and popularity). These holiday prices make them even more worthwhile. Scroll down for over-ear and in-ear headphone deals at Target and Best Buy. <b>Target Black Friday Deals 2019 on Beats Headphones and Earbuds</b></p>

      <p>If you want the “Pure Adaptive Noise Cancelling” (ANC) that actively blocks all that outside noise that might interrupt your listening enjoyment, you will want to upgrade to the Beats by Dr. Dre Studio3’s. These also have what some other Beats products have – “Fast Fuel” that gives you three hours of play time on a 10-minute charge. Personally, when I tested these, that was one of my favorite features. On Black Friday, the price will drop from $349.99 to $279.99 (save $70).</p>

      <p>This super popular Beats by Dre over-ear headphone deal saves you $150 at Best Buy on Black Friday</p>
      <p>Okay, so I know I have these same headphones in a Target deal listed above and it is, well, not as good as this one from Best Buy. <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=106821X1564016&amp;xcust=11142019TJMcCueHeadphonesBeatstjm&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbeats-by-dr-dre-beats-studio-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-gray%2F6316142.p%3FskuId%3D6316142"><b>Studio3 Wireless - $199.99 (save $150)</b></a>. More than double the savings is way better, clearly, but product sells out, so I list both in case this sells out. I would recommend you visit the Best Buy page and bookmark with their “Save for Later” button so you can grab this deal when it goes live on Black Friday.</p>

      <p>Powerbeats are built for a tough workout. These new in-ear with secure-fitting “earhooks” so that you can workout with the confidence that these bad boys are not going to go flying under a 50-pound kettlebell when you move fast. They hold a charge for 9-hours (yes, if you haul the charging case you can pop them back in without connecting to an electrical outlet).</p>

      <p>With almost 24,000 reviews (overall 4.5 rating) on the Best Buy site, consumers love these Powerbeats3 Wireless in-ear headphones. At $89.99, you will save $110 this coming Black Friday. If you are into intense workouts and do not want to mess with your headphones, this model is older than the Powerbeats Pro one above, but almost half the cost. Plus, it holds a battery charge longer – for 12 hours. Now that is an intense workout.</p>
      <p>I will be updating this page as deals change, sell out, or so check back in on this page if you want the latest Beats by Dr. Dre deals this 2019 shopping season.</p>
