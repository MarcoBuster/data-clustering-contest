      <h1>Galaxy S9 gets new November update with improved camera</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:31:13+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:31</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/devices/galaxy-s9/">Galaxy S9</a> and S9+ were updated with the November 2019 security patch <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-samsung-galaxy-s9-update-brings-november-2019-security-patch/">in the first week of this month</a>, and Samsung has now issued a second update with the latest security patch for the Galaxy S9/S9+. It’s unclear why the second update has been released. The November security patch was already available for the S9 and S9+, and while the changelog also mentions improved camera performance, there doesn’t seem to be any actual improvement or new features included in the camera app.</p>
      <p>Samsung does tend to repeat older changelogs for software updates, and it’s possible that is what the company has done this time around as well. However, the update should include some under the hood changes, as the build numbers — <b>G960FXXU7CSK1</b> and <b>G965FXXU7CSK1</b> for the S9 and S9+ respectively — tell us that this is not merely a security update (indicated by the letter ‘U’ after ‘XX’ in the build number; there would be an ‘S’ in place of ‘U’ if this had just been a security update). Just what those changes are is anyone’s guess.</p>
      <p>The new Galaxy S9 update is rolling out in the Netherlands at this time and should soon make its way to other countries as well. You can download it over the air on your phone – open the Settings app, select <i>Software update</i>, then tap <i>Download and install. </i>You can also find the latest firmware for the S9 and S9+ in our <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares">firmware archive</a> for manually updating your device using a Windows PC.</p>
