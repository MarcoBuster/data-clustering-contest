      <p>Startup founders often ask me, "What is the best way to get started launching our brand? Should we start advertising our products directly to who we believe our target audience is or should we first build brand awareness?"It's traditionally been a daunting question that has intimidated many passionate young business owners who are very skilled in design and innovation, yet relatively new to a digital market that appears, at least from the outside, to be too unpredictable, fragmented and complex in nature to understand.</p>
      <p>Often there appears to be no reliable winning solution. For instance, you may think, if we get started advertising our products on Facebook/Google ads and we don't strike gold at first, then we are left with nothing to show for our investment. At the same time, if we simply invest in building brand awareness through influencer marketing, public relations and Instagram content, chances are these indirect marketing efforts will not enable us to generate a profit.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for startup founders, there does exist a tangible, data-driven solution for finding the path of least resistance for investing in sustainable growth and early profits. It's called scientific roadmapping, and it's precisely calibrated to help a brand identify the audience that's going to be most predisposed to become early-adopter consumers (with the least investment capital required) and then harness the mechanics and process to leverage this early adopter community on behalf of the brand in order to elevate status, drive revenues and, ultimately, create a scalable equation a brand can rely on for sustainable growth.</p>
      <p>Here are the broad strokes of this scientific roadmapping process.</p>
      <p>1. A startup's first step is to identify the ripest consumer segment and initial focus market to capture, which they can do through intensive data research on sites such as Alexa and Dovetale.</p>
      <p>2. Once the startup has identified the consumer segments that will respond best to their products, the next step for them is to identify the most pivotal tastemakers on all sides (influencers, media channels, publications, literary critics, online trending feeds, blogs, forums, etc.) for shaping the buying behavior and public perception of this consumer segment in our initial market (which they can do through intensive data research via Alexa and Dovetale technologies).</p>
      <p>3. The startup's third step now is to harness an army or broad coalition of these pivotal tastemakers to unanimously endorse their brand, establishing an industry-wide consensus that their brand is the most trending and desirable brand in their vertical.</p>
      <p>4. Once such an industry-wide consensus governing their target audience is established and begins to seep in from all sides, it's only a matter of campaign reinforcement and time until the startup is able to capture and convert a critical mass of its target audience into customers, delivering them exponential revenue growth.</p>
      <p>5. At this point, deploying ads becomes effective in the law of averages. For once the startup has built a cultural movement and industry consensus in steps three and four, then direct-to-consumer ad campaigns like Facebook ads, LinkedIn lead generation and digital retargeting will start to convert new consumers at a much more dependable and lower cost per acquisition (CPA).</p>
      <p>6. Finally, the beauty of this model is that it turns your digital marketing strategy into a science. Once your sales funnel is established, you would then need to analyze the performance of every tastemaker element and every technical marketing element of the campaign to determine which channels are consistently driving the highest sales and brand-image elevation. Once identified, you would then double down on those premium-performance channels to drive the highest revenue returns every month. Once you have maximized the ROI of your marketing model, you can consider the model to be "nailed<i>,"</i> then you would need to simply scale this nailed model at the rate you desire to deliver your ideal monthly new customer acquisition/revenue targets and thus your ideal growth trajectory.</p>
      <p>Now, it's not always this simple, and the process does require faith and patience during the early stages when setting up market research and positioning (without the validation of early sales). But if you do this, you'll be following the footsteps of successful industry startups who have defied enormous odds in becoming new leaders in their industry after the paradigm shift to digital occurred.</p>
