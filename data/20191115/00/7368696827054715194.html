      <h1>Rare Announces Everwild, New Exclusive Game for Xbox One and Windows 10</h1>

      <p>Everwild, a new Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive game was announced last night during the X019 event. Created by the <a href="https://twitter.com/RareLtd?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">minds</a> behind Banjo-Kazooie, Everywild is a new action-adventure game that looks more like a Breath of the Wild experience than anything else.</p>

      <p>The short trailer for Everwild begins with a gorgeous landscape and shows off even more stunning vistas and wildlife. No gameplay is shown as most of the footage is just a bunch of people lurking around but we get the idea that this game is going to see you explore a vast world in search for something.</p>

      <p>Microsoft has not shared anything else about the game only saying;</p>
      <blockquote>“While <i>Everwild</i> is still early in development, we are very excited about the unique potential of the game we are creating. “The <i>Everwild</i> team is focused on building an experience that allows for new ways to play in a natural and magical world. <i>Everwild</i> will give you memorable, engaging and meaningful experiences for players everywhere to share. We cannot wait to share more with you in the future.”</blockquote>
      <p>Rare released Sea of Thieves last year to some rather dismal reception, however, they worked on the game and it now has its own unique following. Everwild seems to be doing something new but we don’t know if the characters in the trailer represent other players or if this will be its own single-player experience. We will, of course, lean more about Rare and this Everwild game in the coming months. There is no release date but we know it will be landing on Microsoft Xbox One and Windows 10.</p>
