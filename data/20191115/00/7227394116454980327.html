      <h1>Redmi Note 8 Pro gets MIUI 11 stable beta across China, Indonesia and India</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Michail</a></address>
      <p>Last month Xiaomi released its <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/miui_11_global_compatible_xiaomi_devices_rollout_date-news-39655.php">list</a> of devices which will receive MIUI 11. Back then, the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_8_pro-9812.php">Redmi Note 8 Pro</a> was scheduled to get the firmware update in December, and now users in India are reporting that the stable beta build of MIUI 11 is already being seeded to their devices. Prior to that Chinese and Indonesian users also received the update.</p>
      <p>The stable beta is a term used by Xiaomi to describe what other makers typically call Golden Master or Release candidate versions. It should have all the bugs fixed and unless new ones are found at the last minute, it will be more or less identical to the final release.</p>

      <p>The new update comes with build number 11.0.1.0 and also brings the October security patch. It weighs in at 587MB but unfortunately is still based on Android 9, rather than Android 10.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it brings all the new MIUI 11 features like improved gestures, documents preview and Mi Share alongside the new UI design elements and system sounds. The full stable MIUI 11 build is still expected to arrive in December.</p>
