        <b>'The Sun' analysed Ivan Toney's situation, he is Peterborough United's main goalscorer in League One.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The prices for transfers in England do not follow the same reasoning as the rest of Europe. League One side, <b>Peterborough United,</b> have been targetted with <b>many requests</b> to let their star striker,<b> Ivan Toney</b>, go.</p>
      <p><b>The 23-year-old footballer,</b> who had no luck at Newcastle after standing out at Northampton Town in 2014/15, arrived at Peterborough in 2018. After a pilgrimage by teams from the lower leagues, he has found his place at Peterborough United and has aroused great interest in England.</p>

      <p>There, he got <b>23 goals and five assisrs in the 2018/19 season</b> and has already scored <b>12 goals and got 2 assists this season.</b> He is a very versatile forward with a great physique, who can also play on the right wing.</p>
      <p>What's more, <b>Bournemouth and Burnley, </b>the teams who are most interested in signing him,<b> Middlesborough, Cardiff, Bristol City and Derby County</b> have also made it clear that they are interested in the player.</p>
      <p>The Peterborough United boss has already made it clear that they will not give their star away, who he curiously bought from Newcastle for half a million euros:<b> "Toney will break the transfer record for a League One player when he leaves.</b> And it will shatter the 'posh' record".</p>
