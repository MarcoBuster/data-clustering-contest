      <p>CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) - A St. Louis County police officer has agreed to mediation to reach a settlement and avoid court appeals, weeks after a jury awarded him $20 million to resolve his lawsuit alleging he suffered discrimination because he is gay.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis-post-dispatch/">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> reported Friday that both sides have incentives to settle. The county hopes to reduce its liability. Sgt. Keith Wildhaber could keep a larger percentage of the award if he settles.</p>
      <p>Wildhaber’s lawsuit alleged that he had been passed over for a promotion 23 times and was told to “tone down your gayness.”</p>
