      <p>CAIRO – 15 November 2019: Egypt national team delegation leaves the country for Comoros, where the Egyptian team will face Comoros at 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifiers. <br/><br/>The national team striker, Ahmed Gomaa, missed the team journey to Comoros as he suffered an injury on Friday training session. <br/><br/>The Pharaohs aim to bounce back after a poor start at the Qualifiers on Thursday night in Alexandria as Egypt ended the Qualifiers opener with a 1-1 draw with Kenya. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Comoros secured an away victory over Togo thanks to a goal from the nation’s biggest star, Faïz Selemani. <br/><br/>Comoros lead the group with three points, two points ahead of Egypt and Kenya share the second position while Togo stays at the bottom with zero points. <br/><br/>Comoros aim to achieve a victory at home to stay on top of the group and take a major step in their journey to achieve the nation’s dream of appearing at the biggest competition in the continent for the first time in the history.</p>
