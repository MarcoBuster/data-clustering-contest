        <b>ANTHONY Minzie stood out at the recent scholarship awards of the recent Area 4 Police Civic Committee Educational Trust Fund (ETF).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Minzie, who collected the award on behalf of his stepson, Joshua Anderson, a student at Munro College in St Elizabeth, was one of the few parents doing this for the more than 100 high school students from inner-city communities in Kingston and St Andrew.</p>
      <p>“Joshua couldn't make it today,” Minzie said. “The school is a good distance away, and I was in Kingston, therefore I came on his behalf because I love and respect him.”</p>
      <p>Funded by private sector companies, the renewable one-year scholarships were presented to students aged 12 to 18 years in need of financial assistance.</p>
      <p>The awards ceremony was held at Police Officers' Club in St Andrew.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate the scholarship and give my respects to the police officers who made this possible,” Menzie declared. “The financial support is a help to us.”</p>
      <p>Superintendent Tomielee Chambers said that the participation by Minzie demonstrated the commitment from parents that children need in order to be successful.</p>
      <p>“It is a pleasure to see Mr Minzie here, as a father who stands up for his son,” Superintendent Chambers stated. “I hope that this will be an example to other parents to give similar support, which their children definitely need.”</p>
      <p>“Joshua is one of our outstanding students and has been on the scholarship programme for more than three years,” Superintendent Chambers said. She added that the sixth form student at Munro College had maintained a good academic record to be able to remain in the programme.</p>
      <p>Onyka Barrett Scott, general manager, JN Foundation, urged parents in the audience to, “Be your child's biggest cheerleader. Sometimes you are the only one who believes in them. Even when everything looks stacked against them, they need to know that you are in their corner.”</p>
      <p>Wayne Wray, chairman of the Area 4 Police Civic Committee, pointing to the guiding influence of Joshua's mother, said that, “As deputy head boy at Munro, Joshua Anderson looks ahead and recognises that the challenges which he faces will not set him back. He is focused on his goals and is moving ahead.”</p>
      <p>Chris Hind, chief executive officer, JN General Insurance, added that, “Joshua's success is a testimony to the difference that a helping hand can make.”</p>
      <p>“It is not only about the cash given with the scholarships. It is also the support that is provided,” Hind stated. “We can see what is being achieved when so many students who are attaining their academic qualifications return each year to accept their scholarship awards.”</p>
