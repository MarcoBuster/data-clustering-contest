      <p>There has been a 72% rise in hospital admissions over the past five years for children with severe allergic reactions, figures show.</p>
      <p>The data – obtained by a foundation set up by the parents of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret a Manger baguette – shows a rise in cases of anaphylactic shock among those aged 18 and under.</p>
      <p>The NHS Digital figures, shared with the PA news agency, show there were 1,746 hospital admissions for anaphylactic shock in children in 2018/19, up from 1,015 in 2013/14 – a 72% rise.</p>
      <p>When adults are included, there has been a 34% jump from 4,107 cases to 5,497.</p>
      <blockquote><b>1,746<br/></b>Hospital admissions for anaphylactic shock in children in 2018/19<cite>NHS Digital</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Natasha died aged 15 in 2016 after suffering a severe allergic reaction to an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette.</p>
      <p>The product contained sesame seed, to which Natasha was allergic, but this was not listed on the label.</p>
      <p>Her parents have campaigned for a change in the law around food labelling and in June the Government announced “Natasha’s Law” will come into force in 2021.</p>
      <p>This will require foods that are pre-packed directly for sale to carry a full list of ingredients.</p>
      <p>The new NHS data shows a wide regional variation in hospital admissions for children with anaphylactic shock.</p>
      <blockquote>These terrifying figures show we are facing an allergy emergency<cite>Tanya Ednan-Laperouse</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The region with the highest increase was London, where the number of admissions rose 167%, from 180 in 2013/14 to 480 in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>Among children aged 10 and under, the increase was 200%, from 110 to 330.</p>
      <p>Natasha’s mother, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, from the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, said: “These terrifying figures show we are facing an allergy emergency.</p>
      <p>“The number of children with allergies and suffering severe allergic reactions is rising year-on-year at a deeply alarming rate.</p>
      <p>“Scientists don’t yet understand why the numbers of children with allergies are on the rise, which is why it is vital that we invest in large-scale research projects into both the causes and potential cures.</p>
      <p>“We lost our beautiful daughter Natasha to anaphylaxis after she ate an allergen hidden in food.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to see any other family facing the terrible grief that we will always endure.</p>
      <p>“That is why we have set up the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation with the ultimate aim of finding a cure for allergies.”</p>
      <p>Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to a trigger, with food such as nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fruits a common cause.</p>
      <p>Symptoms include feeling light-headed or faint, breathing difficulties or fast, shallow breathing, wheezing, a fast heartbeat, losing consciousness and a severe rash.</p>
      <blockquote>We should not forget that behind each of these numbers is a child or adult who has suffered the most severe consequences<cite>Hasan Arshad</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Many allergy specialists agree that children are more likely than ever to develop food allergies, possibly due to changes in the environment.</p>
      <p>A rise in hospital admissions is thought unlikely to be just due to increasing awareness of allergies and better diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Hasan Arshad, professor of allergy and clinical immunology at the University of Southampton, said: “These new figures confirm what we know is a worrying increase in severe food allergy.</p>
      <p>“We should not forget that behind each of these numbers is a child or adult who has suffered the most severe consequences of an anaphylactic shock.</p>
      <p>“For far too long, allergies have been considered a minor inconvenience. It is time for us all to focus on preventing and curing allergy.”</p>
      <p>The NHS Digital data showed that the East Midlands region recorded the second highest increase in hospital admissions for children – up by 145% across the six years.</p>
      <p>Third came the East of England where the rise was 84%, followed by the West Midlands (59%), North West (56%), Yorkshire and the Humber (50%), South West (24%) and South East (22%).</p>
      <p>In the North East, the number remained static.</p>
