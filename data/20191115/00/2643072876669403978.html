      <p>Odumeje threatened all those who criticize his style of worship and miracles with death while telling them not to play with his anointing as he operates on a higher realm of spirituality.</p>
      <p>This he stated during one of his recent services, here is what he said:</p>
      <p>“<i>If I knack somebody on a chair; you don’t ask me, the man of God this is not the way we are doing miracles. Who born you, where do you come from, what do you know about spiritual. You talk when a dead man talking.”</i></p>
