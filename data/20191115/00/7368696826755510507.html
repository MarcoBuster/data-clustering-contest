      <p>The game features some great and approachable modes including co-op and PvE. You will explore the world through the eyes of a bee as you travel across four giant maps performing bee tasks. The game has been designed in such a way that you will have to face real threats that bees face in the real world such as hive invasions from predators and even the human threat.</p>
      <p>Every bee has its role to play in the game as you collect pollen, explore the giant landscapes and make sure to do your part to help the world around you.</p>
      <p>The latest launch trailer for the game is here and it showcases some snippets of gameplay including what you will do as you discover the world around you.</p>
