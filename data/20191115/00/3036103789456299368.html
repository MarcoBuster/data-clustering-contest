      <h1>Facebook tests Popular Photos – An in-app Instagram</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Facebook is testing a feature called Popular Photos which allows users to scroll through pictures from their Facebook friends – much like users can already do on Instagram.</p>
      <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/facebook-popular-photos/"><b>TechCrunch</b></a> spotted this feature, which allows users who have opened a photo on Facebook to scroll down and view more photos that Facebook thinks they may be interested in.</p>
      <p>As is the case with Instagram, image descriptions are heavily shortened to about 65 characters, meaning that the image remains the primary focus.</p>
      <p>Facebook previously had a “Photos” feature on its desktop version which allowed users to browse through Photos, but this no longer exists.</p>
      <p>Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that it has been running a test of Popular Photos, but did not provide further details on why it is considering implementing this Instagram-like feature on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The tests, which ran in October, have since ceased, but Facebook has plans to do more tests moving forward.</p>
      <h3>Facebook competitor</h3>
      <p>As Facebook works on expanding its content offering, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales recently <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/internet/327753-wikipedia-founder-launches-social-network-to-rival-facebook.html"><b>launched</b></a> a platform which aims to compete with the social media giant.</p>
      <p>The new ad-free platform, called WT:Social, has no financial relationship with Wikipedia but uses a similar model – asking for donations rather than displaying adverts to users.</p>
      <p>“The business model of social media companies, of pure advertising, is problematic. It turns out the huge winner is low-quality content,” Wales said.</p>
