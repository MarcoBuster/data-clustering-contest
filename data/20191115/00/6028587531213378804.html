      <p>If the NFL is indeed all about protecting the shield and its players, the league now needs to step up to the plate after what we saw Thursday night in Cleveland. With eight seconds remaining in a game his Browns were winning, star defensive end Myles Garrett absolutely lost his mind. The Defensive Player of the Year candidate ripped the helmet off Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and proceeded to hit his opponent in the head with said helmet.</p>
      <p>The scene itself was about the ugliest thing we’ve seen in the NFL in decades. It led to Garrett, Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey and fellow Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi all being ejected from the game.</p>
      <p>This isn’t your normal fight. It’s not about punches being thrown or kicks at the bottom of a pile. It’s more than that. By the basic definition of the term, Garrett committed assault against Rudolph. We can focus on Pouncey kicking Garrett or other influences within the incident itself. A lot of that has been seen before. The NFL will address it.</p>
      <p>A player literally ripping an opponent’s helmet off and assaulting him with said helmet is next level stuff. <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2019/11/nfl-players-blast-myles-garrett-call-for-suspension/">A ton of actual football players agreed</a>.</p>

      <p>Earlier this season we saw the NFL suspend Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict for the remainder of the season <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2019/10/02/vontaze-burficts-suspension-places-the-nfl-players-union-in-a-tough-position/">after yet another incident</a>. To be clear, Mr. Burfict has gained a reputation that has not followed Garrett from his days at Texas A&amp;M. One could say it is comparing apples to oranges.</p>
      <p>Even then, we’re talking an extremely violent incident with an item that is used to protect players from serious injury. Said item was used as a weapon outside of the confines of football. It’s far and away what we’ve seen around the league in some time.</p>
      <p>Adding even more fuel to the fire was Garrett’s ho-hum initial reaction to his actions after the game.</p>
      <p>Outside of obvious questions about the Browns’ public relations strategy here, there’s something to be said about feeling remorse after the fact. Showing a bit of penitence. Garrett failed to display this at every turn outside of simply stating that it “was on him.”</p>
      <p>One bright side that came from this situation was the post-game reaction of teammate, quarterback Baker Mayfield.</p>
      <p>“It’s inexcusable. Rivalry or not, we can’t do that,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDarlington/status/1195203325597237248">Mayfield told Erin Andrews of Fox after the game</a>. “That’s endangering the other team. That’s inexcusable. The reality is, he’s going to get suspended. It’s inexcusable.”</p>

      <p>When a team leader, mere minutes after the incident, indicates that a suspension is in the cards, it tells us a whole heck of a lot. Mayfield stood up big time here. He understands the brotherhood that comes with playing sports. It’s not about one team or having a teammate’s back. It’s about a lot more than that.</p>
      <p>This is a lesson the NFL could learn from. Rather than protecting its bottom line like we’ve seen with the <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2014/09/nfl-concussion-lawsuit-findings-startling/">entire concussion issue</a>. Rather than acting as its own body of law in an attempt to protect worn-out dogmas. Rather than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2018/08/17/how-john-elway-directly-helped-colin-kaepernick-in-collusion-case-against-the-nfl/">exiling players from the league in an attempt to cater to a base</a>.</p>
      <p>Rather than all of that, it’s time for the NFL to step up and actually protect its players. Allowing Garrett on the field at any point in the foreseeable future would do damage to the idea that Commissioner Roger Goodell and Co. care about others on the field.</p>
      <p>As of the publishing of this article, hours after the end of the game (3:10 AM ET), the league’s office in New York City had not released a statement. Its official Twitter account last posted about the final score of the game. There’s nothing currently up on NFL.com acknowledging the incident in any official manner.</p>
      <p>That in and of itself is an issue. Even a company line statement acknowledging the incident would have sufficed over the short term.</p>
      <p>None of this is meant to criticize the NFL over the Garrett incident. The league didn’t force the former No. 1 overall pick to take an opponent’s helmet off and commit assault with said object. It’s more about how the league has operated in the past.</p>
      <p>We’re not alone in believing that the NFL should have stepped up and gotten in front of this. One of the players that had a first-hand view of the ugly incident agrees.</p>
      <p>All will be forgiven if the NFL does what it needs to do. Claiming ignorance or attempting to somehow sweep this under the rug until the <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2019/11/colin-kaepernick-to-hold-private-workout-for-nfl-teams/">Colin Kaepernick workout</a> on Saturday takes over headlines is not going to work.</p>
      <p>It’s part of a larger construct and narrative that has led many to believe that the NFL is in this for itself. How in the word does an entity this powerful simply ignore what a national audience witnessed on Thursday night?</p>
      <p>We’re talking about a league that has in the past gone to great lengths to protect its image. Suspending Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2017/08/ezekiel-elliott-nflpa-preparing-for-nuclear-option-against-nfl/">despite assault charges never being filed</a> against the star. Waiting until a video of Ray Rice’s assault incident became public record <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2014/11/10/nfl-needs-to-show-roger-goodell-the-door/#70890d51546a">before taking substantive action</a>. Suspending players four games, 10 games and entire seasons for the use of a substance in marijuana that’s legal in multiple states. <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2016/12/exclusive-eugene-monroe-opens-up-about-the-nfls-drug-policy/">Ignoring the Opioid crisis</a> because it would make the league look bad.</p>

      <p>It’s all about perception and how the public views this multi-billion dollar industry. Maybe it’s now time for the NFL to use that philosophy and combine it with the greater good of its players to send a clear message – one that says the health of said players should stand paramount over everything else.</p>
      <p>Maybe this will happen Friday. The NFL could look at the incident in question and hand out a huge suspension without thinking twice.</p>
      <p>The league could do so without even considering the collective bargaining ramifications that it might have with the NFLPA during ongoing negotiations about an extension. After all, certain members of said union have already called for Garrett to be suspended for the remainder of the season.</p>
      <p>The time for double standards have clearly come to an end here. It ended the minute millions of children around the United States witnessed a barbaric assault on national television.</p>
      <p>What will the NFL do about it to both protect its shield and the league’s players from this type of incident in the future? A precedent needs to be set. Garrett must be banned indefinitely. Anything less than this would paint Goodell and Co. in a horrible light.</p>
