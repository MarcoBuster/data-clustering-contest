      <p>Etihad Airways has relaunched its loyalty programme, with a number of new benefits and a “refreshed look and feel”.</p>
      <p>Gold tier members and above now benefit from a free one-way chauffeur drive service to or from Abu Dhabi airport when travelling in business or first class on a reward ticket.</p>
      <p>In addition Etihad Guest miles will no longer expire, so long as “one eligible transaction is made every 18 months”.</p>
      <p>Members will also soon be able to use their miles (or a combination of miles and cash) to pay for more travel ancillaries, including upgrading to Economy Space, purchasing extra baggage and insurance, paying for excess baggage charges and taxes, and paying for discounted wifi usage.</p>
      <p>The carrier said that discounts for wifi connectivity and seat selection would be offered exclusively to Etihad Guest members.</p>
      <p>Finally a dedicated premium guest service number has been added for the programme’s top tier Platinum members.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the news Robin Kamark, chief commercial officer, Etihad Aviation Group said:</p>
      <p>“We are very proud of the Etihad Guest programme and through its well-timed relaunch are striving to deliver new and more innovative ways of rewarding the loyalty of our millions of guests worldwide, by removing restrictions wherever possible, and by providing a wider range of superior benefits and products, delivered to them with the style and professionalism they have come to expect from Etihad Guest.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to engage with our members, whether existing or new, on an even greater personal level moving forward, so Etihad Guest can evolve based on the needs of our customers, and also to cater to developing global travel trends.”</p>
