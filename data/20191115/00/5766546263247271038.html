        <figcaption>REJECTING MISCHIEVOUSNESS: In furtherance, the leadership of the CDC informs the public that while it welcomes any loan assistance efforts intended to empower ordinary citizens, it however rejects mischievous and un-institutionalized corridors being aligned with the CDC while promoting strange objectives that run counter to the general interests of the CDC and its partisans.</figcaption>

      <p>Monrovia –  The National Executive Committee of the Congress for Democratic Change distances the party from the unauthorized activities of a group operating under the banner ‘Liberians in support for Democratic Change(LSDC), falsely claiming to be a ‘CDC Auxiliary’. Said group (without approval) has launched a ‘Micro loan program’ in the name of the CDC and is already collecting ‘Registration fees’ from struggling citizens  as requirement for membership. The CDC denounces this personal whim as contemptible, misguided  and insensitive to the realities of the challenges we strive to overcome.</p>
      <p>Rebecca, McGill, sister of Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Nathaniel McGill, is also said to be a member of the group, serving as Co-Chair.<br/><br/>In furtherance, the leadership of the CDC informs the public that while it welcomes any loan assistance efforts intended to empower ordinary citizens, it however rejects mischievous and un-institutionalized corridors being aligned with the CDC while promoting strange objectives that run counter to the general interests of the CDC and its partisans.<br/><br/>As a mass-based redemptive movement for its people, the CDC is never short of plans, programs or ideas to empower its own and hence; remains steady in working and advocating for the socioeconomic/educational  uplifting of its members, a necessity considered sine qua non for the strength and robustness of the party.</p>

      <p>This singular objective drives the CDC’s recently launched educational, economic and social development platform, a LOAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM meant to assist our people in market investment initiatives, sustainable livelihoods, health, education, food security, and nutrition. The CDC expected nothing less than the unrestrained commitment and support of its gainfully employed members to this program, a contrast to the un-institutional approach by this group (LSDC) acting outside the knowledge and authority of the CDC. It’s unfortunate that while there continues  to be a lack of commitment by employed officials to support party programs, these individuals (some being government officials) and their cohorts seek creative means to undermine the CDC and its membership by supporting anti-party agendas.<br/><br/>Subsequently, the CDC will launch a formal inquiry into this so-called LSDC micro loan program, alleged to be under the stewardship of the Ministry of Commerce’s Deputy Minister for Small Business, Hon. Jemima Wolokollie. Based on ongoing preliminary findings, the CDC has irrefutable evidence that Deputy Minister Wolokolie, aided by Madam Jackie Capehart, Mr. Joshua Sackie, Mr. Budu Wilson, Mr. George Kailondo, Mr. Rodney Wilson, etc all members or recent ‘Former-members’ of the Unity Party/ANC, has begun setting up CDC structures and appointing District Coordinators with instructions to identify individuals for micro finance loans, among other things. These individuals are encouraged to work through the party’s structures if their aims and objectives are to help empower our partisans.</p>

        <figcaption>The CDC as a robust, active, and most organized political superstructure in Liberia, is open to working with anyone to empower its people as long as our well-capable internal structures are fully utilized as would be authorized by the National Executive Committee.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Nevertheless, being aware that the named individuals are extortionists who fled the CDC for greener Pastures during its challenging moments, and have now returned more sophisticated as a gang of gravy-seekers, one with the same ‘Grab and go’ mentality; the party asks that they desist immediately or face disciplinary actions, ranging from suspension to expulsion within the context of the rule of law.<br/><br/>As the doors of the CDC remain open to all Liberians, it however refuses to yield its principles for compromise to anyone or group of people attempting to creep under the party’s guideposts for sinister purposes. The CDC as a robust, active, and most organized political superstructure in Liberia, is open to working with anyone to empower its people as long as our well-capable internal structures are fully utilized as would be authorized by the National Executive Committee.</p>

        <figcaption>The CDC considers it an extreme provocation and escalation of lawlessness for unauthorized persons to open a loan disbursement office in the name of the CDC a spit throw from its National Headquarters, collecting illegal fees from thousands of partisans without consulting the leadership of the party or seeking its authorization.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Needless to say, the CDC be it Congress or Members of the triune Coalition For Democratic Change, has a fully equipped and functioning Women League, Youth League, County Executive Committee, District Coordinators Council, Auxiliaries Network, or Zonal Executive Committee, that SHALL NEVER be allowed to be sidelined by anyone in the creation of opportunities meant for our people.<br/><br/>In addition, it must be emphasized sufficiently to all that the Coalition for Democratic Change and its collaborating political partners will not submit to the mercies of anyone for loan/opportunities, irrespective of status, wealth or power. This government being a CDC-led one, which continues to enjoy the unlimited support of the party, has to be seen as prioritizing the policy and program interests of those that deliver to it the democratic power it has, nothing less. This stated fact need not be overemphasized as we expect our people to be first in the empowering line of opportunities and support.<br/><br/>Therefore, the CDC considers it an extreme provocation and escalation of lawlessness for unauthorized persons to open a loan disbursement office in the name of the CDC a spit throw from its National Headquarters, collecting illegal fees from thousands of partisans without consulting the leadership of the party or seeking its authorization.<br/><br/>The public is warned that these individuals are acting outside the knowledge and authority of the CDC as we call on all CDCians to remain peaceful and law-abiding while we take steps to resolve this unfortunate incidence within the due process of law.</p>
