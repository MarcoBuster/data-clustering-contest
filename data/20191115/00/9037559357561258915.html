      <p>ISLAMABAD: Shehbaz Sharif on Friday appealed to the people of Pakistan to pray for former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who is embroiled in a legal tiff with the government over the removal of his name from the Exit Control List (ECL).</p>
      <p>Further, Shehbaz said that it is due to the prayers of the people that Nawaz is still alive.</p>
      <p>His (Nawaz’s) health is still deteriorating and it is only prayers that will get him out of this, the PML-N leader noted.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the medical board has suggested that the ailing Nawaz be sent abroad for treatment as delaying it will cause adverse effects on his health.</p>
