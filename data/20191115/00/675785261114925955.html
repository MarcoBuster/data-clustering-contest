      <p>A Remainer branded a Leaver 'childish and petulant' in a fiery Brexit clash on BBC Question Time.</p>
      <p>A woman in the audience called out the young Tory after he said the Conservative Party was 'representing the will of the people' over Brexit.</p>
      <p>She described his comments as 'frustrating' and proposed a second referendum as a compromise.</p>
      <p>The Tory audience member said: "17.4 million people voted to leave the European Union and there's one party representing the will of the people and that's the one party that has promised to leave the EU with a very good deal negotiated by our Prime Minister and that's the Conservative Party."</p>
      <p>However, the Remainer shot back: "I find that very frustrating because you say we voted to leave.</p>
      <p>"You're in Brighton and Hove, 68 per cent of us voted to remain.</p>

      <p>"I get so frustrated about this, we are a country divided. The Tories and Brexit Party want this no-deal terrible deal that will be terrible for our country.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> want to cancel Brexit which in my heart I'd love to do but we can't because that would be terrible for our country.</p>
      <p>"The only option as far as I can see is to go for a second referendum."</p>

      <p>Question Time host Fiona Bruce asked the original speaker whether he was convinced, however he denied he was.</p>
      <p>He added: "If you want a second referendum you either vote Liberal Democrats who scrap <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> full stop - or you vote for Labour who will go with a deal and campaign against their own deal. My goodness what sort of policy is that?</p>
      <p>"What makes you feel qualified to claim that if there was a second referendum people would vote differently?"</p>
      <p>The audience member said it is the Government's job to deliver on the result of the referendum, which he claimed the Conservative Party would do.</p>

      <p>The woman replied: "It's very childish and petulant actually because we are divided and we need to compromise.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Party are now saying that they will renegotiate a deal that will protect workers' rights and the environment, something the Conservatives don't care about at all.</p>
      <p>"They will put that back to the people and remain will be on the ballot. That to me seems like a really sensible compromise."</p>
      <p>Many <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> users suggested the Leaver was a 'Tory plant'.</p>
      <p>Others described the female audience member as 'the hero we need'.</p>
