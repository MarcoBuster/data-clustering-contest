      <p>Cosmic filaments are massive thread-like formations, comprising huge amounts of matter, including galaxies, gas and dark matter.</p>
      <p>They can be 500 million light-years long but just 20 million light-years wide.</p>
      <p>At their largest scale, they divide the Universe into a vast gravitationally linked lattice interspersed with enormous dark matter voids.</p>
      <p>“The spine of cosmic filaments is pretty much the highway of galactic migration, with many galaxies encountering and merging along the way,” said Dr. Charlotte Welker, a researcher at McMaster University, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D) and ICRAR.</p>
      <p>Using data gathered by the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field spectrograph (SAMI) at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, Dr. Welker and colleagues studied each of the target galaxies and measured its spin in relation to its nearest filament.</p>
      <p>They found that smaller ones tended to rotate in direct alignment to the filaments, while larger ones turned at right angles.</p>
      <p>The alignment changes from the first to the second as galaxies, drawn by gravity towards the spine of a filament, collide and merge with others, thus gaining mass.</p>
      <p>“The flip can be sudden. Merging with another galaxy can be all it takes,” Dr. Welker said.</p>
      <p>“The result offers insight into the deep structure of the Universe,” said Dr. Scott Croom, an ASTRO 3D principal investigator from the University of Sydney.</p>
      <p>“Virtually all galaxies rotate, and this rotation is fundamental to how galaxies form.”</p>
      <p>“For example, most galaxies are in flat rotating disks, like our Milky Way. Our result is helping us to understand how that galactic rotation builds up across cosmic time.”</p>
      <p>“The Milky Way, by the way, has a spin well aligned with its nearest cosmic filament, but belongs to a class of intermediate size galaxies that, over all, show no clear tendency towards parallel or perpendicular spins.”</p>
