      <p>Many users of Google products such as Gmail and Calendar will remember the Google Labs ideas incubator. It was here where new features could be toggled on for testing, with the user acknowledging that it was at their own risk. Google announced the closure of Google Labs on July 20, 2011. This did not mean the end of new feature experimentation, though, and developers have been able to test these by way of the nightly Chrome Canary builds. These come with a warning: "Canary can be unstable." Unsurprisingly, nobody using the Google Chrome browser in a "live" business setting, where stability isn't just a nice have but essential, would use such an unstable version of the browser. So when the reason that enterprises around the world were experiencing a "White Screen of Death" that locked up the browser and impacted productivity was confirmed on November 14, it came as something of a shock. Google, it seemed, had been testing an "experimental feature" which was then pushed out to the stable release.</p>
      <h3>What caused the Google Chrome 'White Screen of Death?' </h3>
      <p>Starting November 13, some users of Google Chrome reported that their browser tabs were going blank, the White Screen of Death, and effectively crashing the browser. These incidents were not just a glitch; they were locking employees out of the only browser they could use to access the internet at businesses around the world. <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/19713332?hl=en">Google support forums began to get postings</a> from people wanting to know what was going on. The answer was not well received: an experimental feature called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tPuJE0Vws7oskjjqrawNfMkwFtGxyHV33yQagiplVfY/">WebContent Occlusion</a> that had been in beta for five months had been rolled out to the stable Chrome release.</p>
      <p>Google Chrome engineer, David Bienvenu, <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1024837">said</a> that the feature was turned on "via an experiment that was pushed to released Chrome Tuesday morning." Previously, Bienvenu said, it had been on for around 1% of users, "for a month with no reports of issues."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the broader audience that this "feature" was pushed out to included business users running Chrome on Windows Server "terminal server" environments as well as those running Chrome on Citrix servers. These are commonplace in enterprises, precisely the kind of environment where updates are tested before being released into a “live” scenario to avoid precisely this kind of event.</p>
      <p>All of which made the situation more severe than just a browser glitch as not only are users (including system administrators) in these environments unable to just switch to another browser and carry on, but business-critical functionality can be impacted.</p>
      <p>The experimental feature was designed to reduce resource usage in Chrome by suspending tabs if a user moved other application windows to the foreground, so treating the Chrome tab as a background task. What happened in these environments was that the tab was unloaded instead of being suspended, hence the White Screen of Death.</p>
      <h3>Has Google fixed the Chrome white screen problem?</h3>
      <p>Once the reports started flooding into the support forums, Google started digging into the issue. On November 14, the WebContent Occlusion experiment was "rolled back," and a new Chrome configuration file pushed out to users. "I believe it's more of a pull than a push thing," Bienvenu said, "so once the update is live on the Google servers, the next time you launch Chrome, you should get the new config."</p>
      <h3>So everything is good now?</h3>
      <p>Well, not quite. The incident has left many business users questioning why Google could push out these kinds of changes to what are often very tightly controlled environments. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chrome-experiment-crashes-browser-tabs-impacts-companies-worldwide/">ZDNet reports</a> one sysadmin stating: "We spent the better part of yesterday trying to determine if an internal change had occurred in our environment without our knowledge. We did not realize this type of event could occur on Chrome unbeknownst to us. We are already discussing alternative options, none of them are great, but this is untenable."</p>
      <p>While we are all pretty used to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/10/18/windows-10-security-alert-as-microsoft-warns-do-not-install-this-update/">reading</a> about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/10/12/new-windows-10-warning-as-microsoft-confirms-windows-update-assistant-security-issue/">Windows updates</a> from Microsoft causing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/09/19/windows-10-security-warning-as-microsoft-confirms-update-breaks-windows-defender/">security</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/10/09/windows-10-warning-for-800-million-users-microsoft-says-install-this-update-first/">usability</a> issues, Google Chrome has mostly escaped such bad press, until now. Which is problematical as update pushes, or pulls if you prefer, are essential to maintain the integrity of the browser client from the security perspective. If issues such as the White Screen of Death leads to delays or workarounds when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/11/01/new-google-chrome-security-alert-update-your-browsers-as-high-severity-zero-day-exploit-confirmed/">high-severity zero-day exploits are confirmed for Chrome</a>, then the consequences could be dire.</p>
      <p>I spoke to Ian Thornton-Trump, a cyber threat intelligence expert and CompTIA global faculty member who has sympathy for Google, who obviously "did not want to break all the Terminal Services, Remote Desktop and Citrix servers in the land." However, there's no escaping that the size of the Chrome user base demands better responsibility when it comes to such updates. "The question is what is reasonable due diligence and software testing," Thornton-Trump says, "for what is essentially a free, yet vital component of the software ecosystem?" Which is part of the problem, of course: Chrome is an excellent web browser, but do you get what you (didn't) pay for?</p>
      <p>"There is a reasonable expectation that an upgrade is an improvement," Thornton-Trump says, "but in complex computing environments, you will always have edge cases where best intentions cause major problems." So we are left with the responsibility to take a risk-based approach to updating and test updates before rolling them into production, which it appears many business users were denied in this case. "Thank goodness for the early adopters who vocally identify issues like this," Thornton-Trump concludes, "so that in this case Google can work on a fix for the rest of the install base."</p>
      <p>I have approached Google for a statement regarding this White Screen of Death issue and will update the article in due course should one arrive with me.</p>
