      <p>The likes of Piers Morgan, Chris Moyles, Boy George and Una Healey were in attendance as the Irish community came together from all corners of the British Isles to celebrate.</p>
      <p>To kick off proceedings, guests were treated to a couple of hearty performances by the Irish dance troop Fusion Fighters and the musical stylings of Irish rock-band Aslan, before the awards themselves were handed out.</p>

      <p>"I've always been proud of my Irish roots," said the singer, who admitted to growing up with "amazing, strong Irish women" in his life.</p>
      <p>Next up was actress Anna Friel who received the award for <b>Outstanding Contribution to Film</b> <b>and Television.</b> She spoke of her family roots in Belfast as well as Donegal, before teasing fans with the news that filming of the crime-noir series <i>Marcella</i> - which took place in the Northern Irish capital - has just been completed. Exciting!</p>

      <p>Button-accordionist Sharon Shannon then filled an already jaunty room with more Irish cheeriness before handing back to the presentations.</p>
      <p>Donegal-born businessman Tim Kelly received the award for <b>Outstanding Contribution to Business</b> while Sister Rita Lee won the <b>Outstanding Contribution to the Community</b> award for her years of work helping the less-fortunate around Ireland and the UK.</p>

      <p>"I had my DNA test done last year," Morgan told the audience. "Zero English, almost exclusively Irish.</p>
      <p>"Whether you like it or not, I am one of you," he joked.</p>

      <p>After Eamonn Holmes asked the <i>Good Morning Britain</i> host whether he planned to parade his coveted award around when he returns to TV on Monday, Morgan replied: "I think the <i>Irish Post</i> are going to get one of the longest bits of television in Britain that they've ever seen." - *Thanks Piers!</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Una Healy, from the pop-group The Saturdays, sent shivers down the spine with a gorgeous acoustic set before handing back to Eamonn and Aoife.</p>
