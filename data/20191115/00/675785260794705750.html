      <h1>Paul Hollywood recalls fearing for his life during terrifying confrontation</h1>
      <h2>The silver fox said that his decisions have sparked death threats and related a confrontation with a 6 ft 6" man in Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:01:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ashleigh Rainbird, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ashleigh-rainbird/</a></address>
      <p>It’s a good job <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paul-hollywood">Paul Hollywood</a> is handy with a pair of nunchucks.</p>
      <p>The Great British Bake Off star reveals he receives death threats about his judging decisions, and once feared for his life during a confrontation with a 6 ft 6” man in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“I was looking at him and I thought, ‘I’m dead’” he gulps.</p>
      <p>However, Paul - who demonstrated the martial arts skills he picked up 30 years ago - managed to cool the situation by insisting: “All I do is judge fairy cakes.”</p>
      <p>Which obviously went some way to calm down the angry man, as he ended up inviting him for a pint.</p>

      <p>But Paul, who admitted he had experienced “similar” to the death threats Strictly’s Shirley Ballas has received this series, explains that being able to taste and smell the cakes goes some way to giving him an advantage over viewers watching from home. Which is quite a fair point.</p>
      <p>“I get a lot of people offering me a lot of advice on who should have stayed and who should have gone,” he tells the Jonathan Ross Show. “There are two senses... taste and smell, and they are critical when you’re baking.</p>
      <p>“On camera you look at the colours and the pretty pictures and you go ‘That must taste good’ when it tastes like rubber.”</p>
      <p>The full interview airs on Saturday at 10:10pm on ITV.</p>
