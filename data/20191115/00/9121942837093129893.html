      <p>JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Workers have begun striking at South Africa’s troubled state-owned airline over nearly 1,000 expected job cuts, with flights canceled for at least two days.</p>
      <p>South African Airways has warned that the strike that began Friday morning “endangers the future of the airline.”</p>
      <p>The airline canceled nearly all the international and domestic flights it operates on Friday and Saturday.</p>
      <p>The South African Cabin Crew Association and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa announced the strike shortly after the airline said it is launching a restructuring process that could affect nearly 950 employees.</p>
      <p>The airline says its challenges include insufficient revenue and an aging fleet. It also currently lacks a permanent CEO.</p>
      <p>SAA’s international destinations include New York, London, Hong Kong and Frankfurt.</p>
