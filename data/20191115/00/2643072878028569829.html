      <h1>CAN Reacts As Court Throws Out Busola Dakolo’s Case Against Biodun Fatoyinbo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gbenga Sijuade</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Christian Association of Nigeria</b>, CAN, has urged celebrity photographer,<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/14/just-in-court-rules-on-busola-dakolos-rape-case-against-fatoyinbo/"><u><b> Busola Dakolo</b></u></a> to put the past behind her and reconcile with Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, COZA, <b>Pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo.</b></p>
      <p>This is in reaction to Thursday’s court ruling where Justice Oathman Musa of the Federal High Court in Abuja held that the matter against Fatoyinbo was empty and purely sentimental and awarded costs of N1m against Busola Dakolo.</p>
      <p>Media Aide to CAN President, Rev Samson Ayokunle, Pastor Bayo Oladeji in a statement to Vanguard said that <i>“While we note that the image of the Nigerian Church and its leadership was dented before and during the court proceedings, CAN urges Pastor Fatoyinbo and Mrs Dakolo, to put away all that has transpired and reconcile.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The Church preaches forgiveness and reconciliation, and that is our position as the umbrella body of Christians in the country.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We begrudge neither Pastor Fatoyinbo nor Busola Dakolo, and urge them to extend a similar hand of love and fellowship to each other.”</i>
