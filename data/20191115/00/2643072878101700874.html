      <h1>PDP Mocks El-Rufai For Pleading With Kogi People</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/pdp/"><u><b>Peoples Democratic Party</b></u></a>, has mocked the Governor of Kaduna State, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/nasir-el-rufai/"><u><b>Nasir El-Rufai</b></u></a> and the Deputy Governor of Edo State, <b>Philip Shaibu</b>, for pleading with the people of Kogi State to forgive the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Yahaya Bello.</p>
      <p>The main Opposition party stated that the action of the Kaduna State governor is coming in the late hour.</p>
      <p>PDP on its Twitter account also stated that the pleas of the El-Rufai and Shaibu are <i>“also a direct confirmation that the failed Governor Bello cannot lay claim to any genuine vote at the November 16 governorship election.”</i></p>
      <p>PDP said it noted that <i>“The Edo State deputy governor, Philip Shuaibu, also knelt before the Kogi people to beg for Yahaya Bello which further shows that it is public knowledge that the governor misused the opportunity given to him to lead the state.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Unfortunately, the apology is coming too late in the day and cannot be accepted by the people of Kogi State, whose lives, Yahaya Bello had turned into a living hell in the last four year. Moreover, Yahaya Bello openly confirmed that he is irredeemable as he stood without any sign of remorse while El-Rufai and the Edo State deputy governor begged the unimpressed scanty crowd.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Recall that <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/"><u><b>Naija News</b></u></a> had reported that <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/14/el-rufai-kneels-down-begs-kogi-people-to-forgive-gov-yahaya-bello-video/"><u><b>Gov. El-Rufai pleaded with the people of Kogi State to forgive Gov. Yahaya Bello</b></u></a>, claiming that he’s young, hence will make mistakes.</p>
      <p>PDP stated that the Kaduna governor and APC should have counselled its candidate at the time he was busy suppressing, insulting, abusing and making life unbearable for the people of Kogi State as if there will not be a day of reckoning.</p>
      <p>The party stated that the day of reckoning has come and the people of Kogi State have moved beyond Bello and APC.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“PDP advises Governor El-Rufai to assist Governor Bello in preparing his handover notes as he will surely face a crushing defeat at the polls, come Saturday, November 16th.”</i>
