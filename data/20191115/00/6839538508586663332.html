      <p><i>Why is everyone so focused on “sugary drinks” as the only demon in the diet? According to this report (and the “heart surgeon ad” on TV) by giving up “sugary drinks” people won’t have an issue with obesity because that’s the only thing that contributes to it so they’ll give up the “sugary drinks” and keep on eating all the fatty foods, lollies, ice creams and cakes that they want because, well, they’ve given up sugary drinks like the doctor on telly and the museum told them to so they’ll be fine!</i> Sheila</p>

But they are own problem and we should be grown up enough to deal with them. They are still Australian, and that has to mean something.</i>

      <p>
        <i>Mr Weir deserves an award for his writing. Something more lasting than a rose or a cantaloupe. This piece is absorbing and I am unable to determine whether it is satire or parody. There is an element of ‘sending up the real’ but only if you accept reality television is real, which is difficult to do. Its intellectual depth takes it well beyond wit, so perhaps it is a piece of simple, classic, bitchiness. I adore it.</i>

      <p>
        <i>Jones wants Morrison to declare the drought a National Emergency so federal funds will flow to farmers but Morrison refuses to do this. Jones is quite rightly concerned that farmers are selling for their breeding stock because they can’t afford to feed them as he knows that this will take years to recover from. Morrison kept ignoring this fact, preferring to focus on funding the Govt has provided, which is good but isn’t what farmers need right here right now. The bottom line here is that a whole lot more needs to be done immediately if farmers are to have a viable business once it rains and Morrison needs to understand this and provide the type of support Jones is talking about. Good on Jones for prosecuting the farmer’s case directly to Morrison.</i>

I listen to my doctor for medical advice, my accountant for tax advice, a lawyer for legal advice, an architect for building advice, a mechanic for mechanical advice, etc etc. So knowing my limitations, being conservative and recognising I’m not an expert of the science of climate change, I defer to the experts and conclude we need a balanced and pragmatic response to climate change. Not the hysteria of the extinction revolution protesters and not the closed minded science denying of the sceptics. Surely the issue isn’t whether climate change is happening, but rather what should be Australia’s policy response.</i>

      <p><i>“Thought similar. She previously warned the reprobates in her party impeachment would harm them electorally. She probably knows this isn’t going to go anywhere, will let it run its course and shut up the more extreme fringes of the democrats. It will also be gone by the time of the election. It also gets rid of Biden as you noted, as she is openly supporting Elizabeth Warren.” </i>— <b>Len</b></p>

Class size or resources are certainly secondary factors to this.” - <b>Ben</b></p>

I’ve never seen a team ask to have the shape of the ball checked by the umpires as often as what the Poms are doing while Smithy’s batting. The guy is a genius.</i>

        <i>“Population growth means more housing in areas previously unoccupied. The climate may be slowly increasing but severe weather events that have resulted in greater destruction of property or injuries such as fire, floods and storms are more likely directly resulted to that population growth and urban sprawl. There is also a lot more news coverage now making people more aware of these events but the events have always occurred.</i>

        <i>There are natural occurances of thermals where updrafts of air with different temperatures directly affect weather above it. There have been studies proving that urban areas retain heat greater than green space so the temperature of thermals and temperature of air released upwards varies as cities and new housing estates are reflecting warmer temperatures than previous open fields or areas of trees which released cooler air into the thermals.</i>

        <i>Two of my granddaughter’s who have autism also attended a special school and last year both made their debut together. The night was just so beautiful and the young men and women in the deb group not only thoroughly enjoyed themselves but were just so kind and supportive to each other. It was also lovely to see some teachers stand in to be partners to some of the debutantes. All the best to everyone involved and congratulations to the teachers and the parents for making the effort to give these young adults a most memorable event in their lives.</i>
