      <p>On November 12, 2019, the French journalist Tiphaine Honnet published “Sexualité après 60 ans, la fin du tabou, le début du plaisir” (title translation: "<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex">Sexuality</a> after 60, the end of the taboo, the beginning of pleasure") in <a href="http://madame.lefigaro.fr/bien-etre/sexualite-apres-soixante-ans-fin-du-tabou-debut-du-plaisir-les-seniors-au-septieme-ciel-121119-167902?utm_source=CRM&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=[20191113_NL_MADAMEQUOT]&amp;mediego_euid=[6595047]&amp;een=1b7bbf394acf5d80ed89077525e756dd&amp;seen=6&amp;m_i=vHKuVZu3k_9Lr51T_jwel5G0eIFpPAFgCZ1t%2BwEhPPexGjtFXVKjXIIVgkd_fg5cwaEi3DoZADJwL3YKqhNeIi_tH2hBMPwfvj"><i>Madame Figaro</i></a>.</p>
      <p>In describing an increase in an open embrace of sexuality among older adults, Ms. Honnet cited evidence that ranged from a first erotic novel written by an 85-year-old woman, “75 ans, lorsque nait le desir…” (Translation: "75 years old, when desire is born..."), through the Netflix TV series <i>Grace and Frankie</i>, to a British study in <i>Archives of Sexual Behavior</i>, to interviews with a psychologist, a philosopher, a physician who specializes in sex and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/aging">gerontology</a>, a sociologist, a pornographic filmmaker, and active older people who were happy to share their experiences.</p>
      <p>Honnet’s conclusion is clear: Older (French) people are sexually active. They often enjoy sex more (and more often and for longer duration) than people in younger generations. The latter may be missing pleasures that become possible only when time constraints and the multiple demands of becoming an adult are no longer primary concerns.</p>
      <p>The media is beginning to reflect the cultural shift. In 2018, the award-winning Netflix program <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7255502/awards">The Kominsky Method</a></i> joined <i>Grace and Frankie</i>, a hit since it originally debuted in May of 2015. Both series star icons of cinema. Netflix is clearly tapping into both a huge demographic and a popular topic in the United States, one in which it can bypass censorship standards still held by commercial television and newspapers, all while featuring top talent to make the stories come to life.</p>
      <p>I described research on seven different types of value that sexual touching brings to consenting <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mid-life">mid-life</a> and older adults in my post “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-refracted/201707/benefits-sex-after-50">Benefits of Sex After 50</a>” and of the importance of touch in general to consenting adults in “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-refracted/201907/refresher-course-the-importance-touch">A Refresher Course on the Importance of Touch</a>,” both articles published on my blog “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-refracted">Life, Refracted</a>” in <i>Psychology Today</i>. Today I update these observations by describing three recent articles.</p>
      <p>In July of 2017, Susan Krauss Whitbourne reported that “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201707/intimacy-may-be-one-key-longer-life">Intimacy May Be One Key to a Longer Life</a>.” She described the fascinating research of Tomás Cabez de Baca and his then-UCSF colleagues as they tracked the relationship between sexual <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/relationships">intimacy</a> (responses to “Did you have sexual relations last night?”) and the length of telomeres, one of the best single measures of aging that we have. (The reference for the original article is below.)</p>
      <p>The study’s participants included women In both high and low-<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> situations, as well as other measures that could explain the relationship between sexual relations and longer telomeres, including relationship quality and several physical health indicators. They documented that women who were sexually active had longer telomeres, regardless of other likely ways of explaining the association, than those who were not.</p>
      <p>Here is at least one biological marker that can explain a possible mechanism for the positive relationship between sex and longevity (see, for example, research as early as the 1997 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9448525">report from the Caerphilly cohort</a>). There is a survival benefit to sexual activity (as well as the obvious reproductive one), again confirmed in the UCSF telomere study. Even better, the study confirms at least one biological explanation for this relationship.</p>

      <p>In the spring of 2018, Pepper Schwartz, the sociologist who is an expert on American sexuality, joined with Nicholas Velotta in writing “<a href="https://www.aginglifecarejournal.org/the-changing-nature-of-intimate-and-sexual-relationships-in-later-life/">The Changing Nature of Intimate and Sexual Relationships in Later Life</a>,” published in the <i>Journal of Aging Life Care.</i> Their paper updates what we know from the American research literature concerning the actual sexual behavior and attitudes reported by older Americans. Bonuses offered in this paper are commentary on how research is beginning to include the increasing population of older adults who identify themselves as LGBT; <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a> to challenges to desires for sexual behavior faced by residents in age-segregated facilities for older adults; and the potential impact of breast or prostate cancer, diabetes, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a>, maladies common in older adults that can radically affect sexual attitudes and behavior.</p>
      <p>A further strength of this paper is the recognition of the cultural shift in perspectives regarding sexuality that baby boomers bring with them as they are moving into their seventh decade. The paper by Dr. Schwartz and Nicholas Velotta thus underscores the increasing presence of sexual interest and activity reflected in older adults that is the focus of Tiphaine Honnet’s article in <i>Madame Figaro</i>.</p>

      <p>A third interesting recent study regarding sex and well-being focused on the “Frequency of sexual activity and long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction,” authored by Shlomit Brandis Kepler and her colleagues, that appeared in <i><a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(19)30554-6/fulltext">The American Journal of Medicine</a> </i>in 2019. The Israeli researchers were able to study records that included reports from 1,120 consenting patients on their sexual activity following their first MI, when they were 65 or younger, across the 22 years that followed.</p>
      <p>The data included periodic follow-ups of medical, psychological, and psycho-social well-being, as well as mortality confirmed through multiple sources. Sexual activity, regardless of frequency, was associated with longevity, even after considering age, sex, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/smoking">smoking</a>, weight, leisure physical activity, cardiovascular risk factors and severity, other illnesses, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/education">education</a>, and whether or not the respondent lived with a steady partner.</p>
      <p>These articles provide a window into a societal shift in perspectives regarding sex for people in midlife and beyond, whether or not they are in a long-term <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-refracted/201611/10-essentials-about-midlife-love-relationships">mid-life love relationship</a>. They suggest that consenting adults who consciously decide to explore their sexuality, as long as no health or legal impediments argue against it, are in increasingly expanded company.</p>
      <p>Is this an antidote to the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> of intimacy and consequent <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-refracted/201905/is-fear-intimacy-becoming-the-new-normal">loneliness fostered by increasing technology</a> or an outcome of easier access through technology? What will happen to the quality of relationships—will they become even more casual and fragmented, or will we discover means to deepen personal relationships through the profound communication that sex allows?</p>
      <p>Have your attitudes about sexuality changed as you have aged? Have they become more curious, expansive, liberal, or less so? Have you made adaptations over the years? Are they more satisfying or less so?</p>

      <p>I think the perspective of the article assumes an individual view, like your own health, your own sexual desire, what you want to do sexually, how have I aged, have I become more expansive and liberal, is it more satisfying to me, what are my attitudes etc.</p>
      <p>Unless you are talking about masturbation, the single biggest problem for many people in middle age, aside from these "me" issues, is that you need a partner who is on the same page. And the problem is that, even though you may have been well-matched sexually when you first met years ago, it's the changes that make things difficult, and not necessarily the changes in ourselves, but the changes in our partner that do NOT coincide with our own changes.</p>
      <p>It's mostly a myth that couples age sexually in some sort of golden synchronous harmony, where both learn to explore more alternative ways of having sex as they both harmoniously slow down at the same agreeable rate. Mostly, that's not what happens, unfortunately.</p>
      <p>So what actually happens in many cases is that the woman loses a lot of sexual interest with menopause, and intercourse becomes difficult and painful. There are remedies, HRT, etc., but it doesn't always really restore things and especially the wanting. And too often, it seems women like that just happen to be married to men who continue to want lots of sex and have little trouble with ED well into their 60's and 70's.</p>
      <p>And then you have women who are healthy and still interested in sex, but they are married to men with ED who smoke and are overweight, and don't want the embarrassment of going to the doctor to explain the problem, and for some of these men, Viagra doesn't really work.</p>
      <p>And a whole host of other medical issues which make sense difficult for one partner, but not the other.</p>
      <p>And so what you have a lot more of in middle and older age is gray divorce, etc. And you have mistresses who hook up with an older man who is married with kids and know that his wife is no longer interested in sex (heck, even an aunt in my own family admitted she had a man like that with a family when she was young and busy with a career and didn't want a full marriage and relationship -- she just wanted some good nights out with a considerate man).</p>
      <p>And the reason STIs are up among seniors is obviously NOT because a lot of monogamous couples are having more sex -- STIs don't transmit that way!! Again, it has to do with sexual incompatibility that has increased as people age in many cases.</p>
      <p>So, yes, older people are having sex, but it's not so much the monogamous golden synchronized loving hugging sex you think it is. Just talk to sex workers about the huge bump in business around the time social security checks come out, meaning a lot of men in their 60's and 70's.</p>
      <p>Now, that's not to say there aren't people who are perfectly willing to have sex with their partner, who yet goes out and cheats with someone else. But there are certainly a lot of people who want sex but their spouse is not interested or capable, and often not interested in becoming capable.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Kent Drake on November 16, 2019 - 5:49pm</p>
      <p>All of your points are valid, but don't really respond to the article. Sure, plenty of old folks aren't having sex for a number of reasons. The message I'm getting from the article is that the norms have changed. The label "dirty old man" was used to describe any old geezer that still had a sex drive, but not anymore. Now it's considered normal ... even a good thing.</p>
      <p>The article says:<br/>"These articles provide a window into a societal shift in perspectives regarding sex for people in midlife and beyond, whether or not they are in a long-term mid-life love relationship."</p>
      <p>It doesn't dwell on whether a senior citizen has a mate or not. You seem to pooh pooh the article because many married couples aren't on the same page. What you say is true. But, the issue isn't what percentage of seniors are enjoying an active sex life, it's that many are having sex and loving it. And, that it's a good thing. And, that seniors aren't embarrassed about it. They shouldn't be.</p>
      <p>I'm pushing retirement age. My takeaway from this article is very positive and upbeat. My wife and I have an active sex-life and I hope to keep it that way for a long time. We both agree with the saying: "Use it or lose it".</p>

      <p>You're right, it doesn't respond directly to the article, and it wasn't meant to respond that way. It was in addition to the article, in that the article didn't specify the kinds of partnerships that take place. Many might think it's the golden harmony, such as it seems to be fore you. But for a great many older people, it's not.</p>

      <p>Hey genius, so to avoid becoming a grandparent yourselfs, shoot for lots of drinking, smoking, a diet of beef, get fat enough to be morbidly obese, and die before 50. Or plan to never have kids that can make you a grandparent? Stay single, and hire prostitutes instead.</p>
