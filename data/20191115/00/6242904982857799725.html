        <b>Ghana will engage Ivory Coast in the semifinal of the ongoing U23 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Black Meteors defied all odds to book a place in the semifinal round after beating Mali 2-0 in the last group game on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Coach Ibrahim Tanko’s men needed to overcome their West African counterparts to qualify for the seminal round after failing to record victory in their first two games.</p>
      <p>Despite struggling to dominate their opponents, Ghana managed to grab the group’s second qualifying ticket following a late brace from substitute forward Kwabena Owusu to win the game 2-0.</p>
      <p>Before Thursday’s match, Ghana were sitting on 3rd spot with just a point behind Egypt and Cameroon who had 6 and 4 points respectively.</p>
      <p>However, a 2-1 defeat against Egypt changed the dynamics of the group standings.</p>
      <p>Cameroon were outclassed by the young Pharaohs — who went into the game already qualified after Monday’s 3-2 win against Ghana.</p>
      <p>Ghana after finishing 2nd in Group A will square off against neighbours Ivory Coast who topped Group B with six points with Egypt taking on South Africa.</p>
      <p>The Baby Elephants inflicted a 1-0 defeat on Zambia in the final group game on Friday while South Africa hold Nigeria to a goalless draw.</p>
      <p>The result means Ivory Coast and South Africa are the two countries from Group B to advance to the semifinals round.</p>
      <p>Ghana will play Ivory Coast on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
