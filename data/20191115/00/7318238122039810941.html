      <h1>Trump asks Supreme Court to keep his tax returns away from prosecutors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:44:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:44</time> by <a rel="author">Dareh Gregorian and Hallie Jackson and Kristen WelkerÂ </a></address>
      <p>Lawyers for President Donald Trump want the Supreme Court to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/manhattan-da-subpoenas-trump-s-tax-returns-probe-hush-money-n1055046">block New York prosecutors</a> from obtaining his tax returns.</p>
      <p>"We have filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to overturn the 2nd Circuit decision regarding a subpoena issued by the New York County District Attorney. The 2nd Circuit decision is wrong and should be reversed," Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told NBC News late Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Manhattan D.A. subpoenaed Trump's tax preparer, Mazars USA, for eight years of his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/manhattan-da-subpoenas-trump-s-tax-returns-probe-hush-money-n1055046">personal and business tax returns</a> earlier this year as part of an investigation into pre-election payoffs to two women who alleged they'd had affairs with Trump.</p>
      <p>Trump's lawyers filed suit to block the move, arguing that state authorities cannot investigate a sitting president. A Manhattan federal court judge <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-loses-new-york-court-fight-keep-tax-returns-hidden-n1063186">sided with the D.A.</a>, and Trump's lawyers appealed to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-loses-appeal-new-york-tax-case-must-hand-over-n1076061">ruled against the president</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>"There is no obvious reason why a state could not begin to investigate a president during his term and, with the information secured during that search, ultimately determine to prosecute him after he leaves office," the appeals court ruling said.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors from D.A. Cyrus Vance's office had agreed to give Trump's team <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/manhattan-d-trump-lawyers-strike-deal-speed-fight-over-trump-n1069751">time to appeal to the Supreme Court</a> before they try to enforce the subpoena. The delay will remain in effect until the high court either declines to hear the case or issues an opinion.</p>
      <p>"We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will grant review in this significant constitutional case and reverse the dangerous and damaging decision of the appeals court," Sekulow said.</p>
      <p>Because the tax documents were requested under a grand jury subpoena, it's unlikely they will become public if turned over. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-wages-coast-coast-legal-battle-keep-tax-returns-hidden-n1069981">Trump is engaged in</a> a series of legal battles across the country to keep his tax returns private. He is the first president to refuse to voluntarily make his tax returns public since <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/flashback-richard-nixon-released-tax-returns-while-under-audit-n573036">Richard Nixon</a>, who begrudgingly released them in 1973.</p>
