      <p>The Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN) says the election results of special voting which was conducted on Wednesday and currently being shared on social media, have not been verified by the electoral body.</p>
      <p> “In terms of the management of foreign votes, once the presiding officers have posted the results at their respective polling stations, they are required to seal the ballot boxes and place them in diplomatic bags for return to Namibia. The ballot boxes shall be opened at the ECN Head Quarters in Windhoek and counted under the supervision of the Chief Electoral and Referenda Officer after the polling stations have been closed on 27 November 2019 for collation,” Chief Electoral Officer, Theo Mujoro said.</p>
      <p>“The ECN will soon announce the official channels through which election results will be disseminated and hereby wishes to discourage the electorate and the general public from trusting results shared on social media platforms due to the menace of fake news and misinformation.”</p>
      <p>He said despite delays in Stockholm and Dar es Salaam, all the polling stations for special voting had opened on time.</p>
      <p>“The ECN established a total of 34 polling stations at Namibia's' foreign missions abroad. The actual polling process was conducted without any hiccups, in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Act and all stations closed on time at 21:00pm local time in the respective countries,” Mujoro said.</p>
      <p>Locally, he said 154 polling stations had been established across the 121 constituencies to enable those that qualified to vote under the special voting to cast their votes.</p>
      <p>“The ECN also wishes to inform the electorate and the nation at large that the process was conducted successfully despite the low turnout observed at some polling stations,” Chief Electoral Officer.</p>
      <p> He said some incidents were recorded during the voting process by the body.</p>
      <p>“The ECN also noted an incident at a polling station //Kharas region were the ballot unit had to be disconnected from the control unit to be re-attached after it fell while a voter was trying to get behind the voting booth. A number of other administrative errors relating to handling of election forms and technical issues related to the EVM's were noted by Presiding Officers at a few polling stations. The ECN is carefully analyzing all relevant issues noted by respective Presiding Officers in the Occurrence book with a view to improve business processes and systems as part of preparations for the all-important national elections slated for 27 November 2019,” Mujoro said.</p>
      <p>Special voting is aimed at allowing Namibians abroad, on board vessels, members of the Police Force, Defense Force and Correctional Services and those who are required to be on duty within or outside of Namibia to cast their votes in the 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections.</p>
