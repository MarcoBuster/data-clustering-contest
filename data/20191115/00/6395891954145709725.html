      <p><b>CLEVELANDÂ (AP)</b> - Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Joe Haden will play against the Browns, his former team, after missing practice with an undisclosed illness.</p>
      <p>Haden sat out Wednesday's workout and was listed as questionable for the Steelers (5-4), who have won four straight and five of six after a 1-4 start. Haden was drafted by Cleveland in the first round in 2010 and released after seven seasons.</p>
      <p>The Browns (3-6) will be missing starting defensive end Olivier Vernon, who will miss his second straight game with a knee injury. Vernon, who came to Cleveland in the March trade that also brought wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Browns, got hurt on Nov. 3 at Denver.</p>
      <p>Chad Thomas will make his second start in a row in Vernon's spot.</p>
      <p>Cleveland's biggest pregame move was releasing troubled wide receiver Antonio Callaway. The 22-year had been benched Sunday for arriving late for the game.</p>
