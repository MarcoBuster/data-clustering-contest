      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/jan-arreza/" target="_blank">Jan Arreza</a></address>
      <p>According to the ACCC’s latest quarterly <i><a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/regulated-infrastructure/communications/national-broadband-network-nbn/nbn-wholesale-market-indicators-report/september-quarter-2019-report"><u>Wholesale Market Indicators Report</u></a></i>, NBN is now providing over 6.1 million homes with broadband services, with more than half a million new services added between July and September.</p>
      <p>Telstra remains the dominant acquirer of wholesale NBN services, with 48.1% of all connections, and while market shares vary each quarter, Telstra’s market share has declined from a peak of 50.1% in June 2017 and TPG Group’s market share has fallen from about 23.4% to 22%.</p>
      <p>During this period, Optus increased its market share from 12.8% to 15.2%, while Vocus’ share fell slightly. The collective share of other access seekers increased from about 5.7% to 7.3%.</p>
      <p>The report also highlights that the number of higher speed plans taken up by Australian consumers continues to increase, with almost two-thirds of all NBN services now of higher speeds of 50Mbps and above.</p>
