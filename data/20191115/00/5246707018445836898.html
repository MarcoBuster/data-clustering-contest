      <p>After being <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/minecraft_dungeons_confirmed_for_nintendo_switch">delayed</a> earlier this year, Mojang has now confirmed its new title <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft_dungeons">Minecraft Dungeons</a></b> will arrive on the Switch and multiple other platforms in April next year.</p>
      <blockquote>Coming to PC, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, Xbox One and Xbox Game Pass in April 2020.</blockquote>
      <p>The game itself is described as an "all-new action-adventure" inspired by classic dungeon crawlers of yesteryear.</p>
      <p>You'll battle nasty mobs alongside three other players with your very own unique character in online or local play – while powering up your weapons and items, and collecting as much treasure as possible.</p>
      <blockquote>Classes? Never heard of them! Minecraft Dungeons is all about how you build your character with the gear you aquire. Want to be a hard-hitting wizard-knight-rogue with a top hat? Nothing is stopping you!</blockquote>
      <p>The main quest is to defeat the evil Arch-Illager.</p>
