      <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The Philadelphia Eagles have signed running back Jay Ajayi, bringing back a key offensive player from their Super Bowl championship team two years ago.</p>
      <p>Ajayi replaces Darren Sproles. The veteran was placed on injured reserve Friday because of a torn right hip flexor muscle.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia’s leading rusher, Jordan Howard, has a shoulder injury and is questionable when the Eagles (5-4) host New England (8-1) on Sunday. Coach Doug Pederson said Ajayi could play despite not practicing with the team.</p>
