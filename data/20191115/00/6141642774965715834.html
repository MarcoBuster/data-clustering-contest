      <p>Women are featuring in just a fifth of national press coverage of the General Election campaign, according to research.</p>
      <p>Academics at Loughborough University noted “gender inequality across all coverage” from November 7 to November 13.</p>
      <p>The research found that when considering all participants in election news coverage – including citizens, business people, experts and public professionals – women’s voices accounted for just a third of all quotation in TV news and a fifth of quotation in the national press.</p>
      <p>On television, women’s voices made up 32.9% of the share, while men had 67.1%.</p>

      <p>Overall, women featured in 21.4% of the coverage, while men were much more prominent on 78.6%, according to Loughborough University’s Centre for Research in Communication &amp; Culture.</p>
      <p>The researchers said: “The data show that female actors are marginalised in cumulative terms in comparison with their male counterparts during the election campaign so far.”</p>
      <p>This gap is despite women leading a number of political parties.</p>

      <p>The data comes from the first in a series of weekly reports from the university on UK wide television and print media reporting of the 2019 UK General Election.</p>
