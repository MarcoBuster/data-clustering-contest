      <p><b>Zillow Group (NASDAQ: ZG)</b>, an American online real estate database company, which operates the largest portfolio of real estate and home-related brands on mobile and the web, focusing on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling and financing, has seen its stock price rise by close to 26% over the last month, driven by stronger Q3 2019 results that beat estimates on both revenues and earnings. The stock has reacted strongly, since the company actually saw a major sell-off post its Q2 results when it warned of an underwhelming outlook. However, revenue growth over Q3 was stronger-than-expected at about 117%, taking Q3 revenues to $745.2 million, much higher than analysts’ expectation of $718 million. Though Zillow started as an advertising platform, it added another segment with the launch of Zillow Offer last year, which gives home sellers the option to sell directly to Zillow, which then finds a buyer and resells the home itself. The new segment brought in $384.6 million in revenue in Q3 2019, compared to just $11 million in Q3 2018 when the business was just kicking off. Core business also saw healthy growth of 7% during the same period. Company posted adjusted loss of $0.12 per share in Q3, much better than market expectation of loss of $0.22/share. Moreover, the company is projecting robust revenue growth rates of between 116% to 126% for Q4 2019.We ‘step back’ from these recent swings to review Zillow Group’s performance over the last few years, as a context for what might come next.
