      <h3>Okowa Defeats Ogboru At Appeal Court</h3>
      <p>The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Friday affirmed the victory of <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/ifeanyi-okowa/"><u>Ifeanyi Okowa</u></a></b> as the duly elected governor of Delta State.</p>
      <p>The appellate court in its ruling, dismissed the suit filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/great-ogboru/"><u>Great Ogboru</u></a></b> against Okowa’s victory.</p>
      <p><b>Justice Uzo Ndukwe-Anyanwu</b> who headed the five-member panel of the appeal court disclosed the panel in a unanimous decision, dismissed the appeal by Ogboru and the APC for lack of merit.</p>
      <p>The panel ruled that the appellants failed to prove their case.</p>
      <p>With Friday’s ruling, the Appeal Court has now upheld the judgment of the tribunal which had in September, affirmed Okowa’s victory at the polls.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> recalls the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Asaba, the Delta state capital had <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/09/21/tribunal-affirms-okowas-re-election/"><u>upheld the election</u></a></b> of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as the authentic winner of the March, 9, 2019 governorship election.</p>
      <p>Ogboru, APC candidate had in his petition marked EPT/DT/GOV/01/2019, alleged that the election was marred with irregularities, over-voting and substantial non-compliance with the electoral act and guidelines.</p>
      <p>Not satisfied by the tribunal judgement, Ogboru had approached the Appeal Court which has now also rejected his appeal on Friday.</p>
