      <h2>Lexus GX 460 gets mean new look for 2020 model year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:49:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>Like the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado but want something a bit more extravagant? Then the plusher Lexus GX 460 is just the leather lined 4x4 for you. Just in time too as Lexus Manila Inc. (LMI) has quietly brought the refreshed version for the 2020 model year.</p>
      <p>First unveiled back in <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/what-a-big-grill-you-have-2020-lexus-gx-460.html">June 2019</a>, the updated GX 460 gets a bolder-looking front fascia courtesy of a new spindle grill and headlight design. Borrowing styling cues from the ES and LS, the new grill design gets a bit more flair thanks to a new 'chevron' pattern. The chrome surround on the grill itself is now bigger as well which further lends to the GX's more discerning look.</p>

      <p>Apart from its new face, the exterior of the GX 460 largely remains the same. From the 18-inch alloy wheels, side skirts, flared wheel arches, and combination taillights, Lexus went for the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' approach for the rest of the body.</p>
      <p>Inside, however, Lexus was quite busy changing several portions of the GX 460's cabin, albeit discrete. For starters, it now has a new three-spoke steering wheel instead of a four-spoke design. The instrument cluster appears to have been redesigned for a fresher, more contemporary look. It even has a newer multi-information display which is a lot bigger than before. Rear passengers that need to recharge their gadgets will be glad to know the SUV now has additional charging.</p>

      <p>Heaps of leather, wood trim, as well as other high quality materials continue to surround the cabin of the 2020 GX 460. A moon roof is also available on the refreshed SUV which makes for a more fun driving experience. Other standard amenities inside the GX include three-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats and steering wheel, touchscreen infotainment with navigation, and a 17-speaker sound system.</p>
      <p>As before, the GX 460 gets its power from a 4.6-liter, naturally aspirated V8 with Dual VVT-i. It pushes out 292 PS at 5500 rpm along with 438 Nm of torque at 3500 rpm. Power is then shifted to a full-time 4WD system and six-speed automatic transmission.</p>

      <p>As far as safety is concerned, the GX has that covered. You get anti-lock brakes with electronic brakeforce distribution and brake assist, stability and traction controls, front and rear parking sensors, a host of airbags for the front and rear passengers, cruise control, crawl control (for off-roading), and a tire pressure monitoring system.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Lexus GX 460 retails at Php 5,898,000.</p>
