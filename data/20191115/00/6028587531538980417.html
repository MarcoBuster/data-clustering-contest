      <p>Do you know the old adage "don't sweat the small stuff"? You should not only sweat the small stuff but carefully contemplate, study and perfect every (seemingly) minor detail that comprises a greater whole, movement or even paradigm shift in the marketplace.<b>Review Every Detail, Even If You Think It Can Be Delegated</b></p>
      <p>Thoughtfully considering every detail of my business has been my approach since the day I decided to leave my job in banking to start a real estate development company and, later, other ventures in wellness, hospitality, tech and fashion. I learned quickly that, regardless of your role in the marketplace or the product you sell or service you provide, we are all architects of our respective trades. The examples are limitless, but I want to start with a more literal example that involves actual buildings: the hotel industry. While traveling, I found myself engrossed in the story of how the boutique hotel was born. Not a hotelier myself, I found solace that I am compelled to share.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Design</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hoteliers Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell's work in the early 1980s created a profound shift in the role of design, not just in hotels but also in many aspects of American culture; I am unsure, though, that monumental achievement was truly part of their original plan. They did this through a series of small decisions that in the aggregate transformed the hotel industry with the creation of a new genre and alternative to the status quo at the time: old-fashioned luxury or bland modern boxes, heavily standardized and uninspired.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Talent Details</b>
      </p>
      <p>Creating the best company requires hiring the very best talent. It's natural to want to hire very experienced people, but sometimes the most creative seemingly small ideas will come from people who have deep experience in parallel areas.</p>
      <p>Schrager and Rubell hired modern visual artists like Julian Schnabel and designers who had never worked on a hotel project, purchasing furniture at Parisian flea markets to create an exciting unpredictability in the final product. A series of small decisions like using mismatched furniture, bold graphic throws, stainless steel sinks and edgy black-and-white photography made these spaces resemble a fashionable living room rather than a commercial space. Some industry folks thought they were crazy; others predicted their failure. However, that small stuff became the ingredients that major corporate hotel flags used to imitate and freshen up their own brands, creating new models within their brands to respond to the now changing, more competitive hotel market. Had Schrager and Rubell only hired designers with deep hotel experience, this design never would have come to light.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Customer Experience</b>
      </p>
      <p>This resembles how Whole Foods transformed the way we consider the grocery shopping experience: from their kelly green logo (forcing an association with freshness) to their development of a true dining experience within the store (ready-to-go food, food prepared on-site for consumption, beer and wine service) to directly linking mind-body health to the food we eat (in-store massage chair service and staging the store with an entire health products section). Each detail on its own does not hold the power that all of those elements together create.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Know What Your Customers Care The Most About</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another example, in constant flux, is the sports apparel industry. Whether it is footwear, specialized sports attire or the equipment itself, every detail matters. Think about the last piece of "athleisurewear" you purchased. What influenced you? Likely some small feature that caught your eye or stood out as uniquely your style. It's generally something as simple as a logo that's been minimized (creating an elegance) or maximized (covering the entire product like a flag). Or the texture of a new high-performance fabric in a color that is in vogue. Those small details are carefully assembled to direct your experience of the product.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Know What Will Differentiate Your Products And Services</b>
      </p>
      <p>The minds behind each business venture knew they could potentially accomplish something innovative and even revolutionary with a keen attention to detail, constructing a brand or experience that would endure. It is about approaching work from an entirely different perspective, allowing yourself to be influenced by your surroundings and those different than you. If you are striving to be innovative and fresh, being open to those with different perspectives, experience and experience levels is key. I believe that is ever more true with the existence of electronic media, the rapid speed at which people can access information and the rate at which information is shared. As a result, it has come increasingly difficult to stay ahead of the curve and be considered truly innovative.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appreciate The Little Things, But Don't Let That Slow Down Your Innovation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Business minds who sweat the small stuff force long-standing brands to rethink what people need and want. One of the morals of the story: No one should rest on their laurels for too long. The business world, due to how fast information travels now, changes at a speed no one anticipated. This speed also makes competition all the more fierce and consumers even more fickle than ever and difficult to identify. The question that likely keeps all of us up at night is, how do we stay competitive, fresh and in-demand?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Focus On Yourself, Too</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, in business, sweating the small stuff helps you grow, evolve and stay competitive. In your personal lives, you may want to subscribe to the more popular sentiment and don't sweat the small stuff. As a type-A speaking to fellow type-A's, establishing the proper balance in our personal lives is as important as understanding our respective industries and how to succeed. While you are working 24/7, do not forget to tend to yourself. In our day to day, the small stuff is just that; do not lose sight of the huge accomplishments you have made in your industries and the potential for yourself to do even more.</p>
