      <p>Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft has departed from the asteroid Ryugu, where it landed twice on the surface to collect samples, and is now journeying back to Earth to arrive in late 2020.On Wednesday, November 13, the Japanese space agency (JAXA) confirmed that Hayabusa2 had fired its chemical propulsion thrusters to leave its orbit around the asteroid. “The thruster operation of Hayabusa2 occurred nominally,” JAXA said in a short statement. “The velocity leaving from Ryugu is approximately 9.2 centimeters per second.”</p>
      <p>The spacecraft is now busy taking its final images of Ryugu, which it will continue sending back for the next few days as the asteroid gets smaller and smaller. Eventually it will cease taking images and focus its attention on Earth instead, most likely giving us our last-ever glimpse close-up of Ryugu.</p>
      <p>Hayabusa2 was launched from Earth in December 2014, arriving at the asteroid Ryugu in June 2018 about 300 million kilometers from Earth. The spacecraft then began an ambitious mission to not only study the asteroid, but collect samples from its surface.</p>
      <p>In September 2018, it deployed two small one-kilogram rovers called Rover 1A and 1B onto the surface of Ryugu, which returned the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45598156">first-ever images taken by rovers on an asteroid</a>. Then in February 2019 it performed an even more impressive feat, when the entire 500-kilogram spacecraft itself landed on the asteroid.</p>
      <p>Touching the asteroid with a long arm and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2019/03/05/japan-releases-incredible-asteroid-landing-footage-from-its-hayabusa-2-spacecraft/">firing a projectile into the surface</a>, it is hoped that the spacecraft scooped up some samples from the asteroid into a capsule on the spacecraft. We will not know for sure until the spacecraft drops the capsule off at Earth in December 2020, where it will be recovered from the Australian desert after passing through Earth’s atmosphere and descending via parachute.</p>
      <p>A second sample of Ryugu was also taken by Hayabusa2 in July 2019. This time, however, the spacecraft collected a sample from near a small crater it had <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2019/07/09/a-japanese-spacecraft-is-about-to-try-and-land-in-a-hole-it-blasted-in-an-asteroid/">blasted into the surface</a>. Having been shielded from the Sun, it is thought this sample could contain <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2019/07/11/japan-makes-history-with-second-asteroid-landing-to-scoop-material-from-the-dawn-of-the-solar-system/">pristine material</a> from the dawn of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, when the asteroid formed.</p>

      <p>The spacecraft’s shorter one-year journey home, compared to the nearly four years it took to reach the asteroid, is due to Ryugu now being closer to Earth. The spacecraft will use its ion engines to gradually make its way back, with the possibility that it could even be sent to another target in the Solar System after dropping off its invaluable cargo.</p>
      <p>Hayabusa2 was the successor to the Hayabusa1 mission, which visited the asteroid Itokawa in 2005 and returned samples to Earth in 2010. Its sampling system malfunctioned, however, meaning only a tiny sample of one millionth of a gram was brought home. Hayabusa2, conversely, is hoped to have <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/japans-asteroid-mission-faces-breathtaking-touchdown">several grams</a> of material on board.</p>
      <p>Mission planners will now be eagerly awaiting the spacecraft’s return, to see what it has found. Its discoveries could help us not only look back into the Solar System’s history, but perhaps probe the origins of water or even <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-search-of-lifes-origins-japans-hayabusa-2-spacecraft-lands-on-an-asteroid/">life on Earth</a>. “This is an emotional moment!” the team <a href="https://twitter.com/haya2e_jaxa/status/1194425273355296768">tweeted</a> on Tuesday, November 13. And the best is yet to come.</p>
