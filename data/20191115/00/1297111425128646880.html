      <p>Head coach Craig Dickenson is “confident” the Saskatchewan Roughriders will have franchise quarterback Cody Fajardo on the field for Sunday’s West Division final against the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p>
      <p>Dickenson offered positive news on <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-being-cautious-with-quarterback-cody-fajardo">Fajardo’s recovery from an injured oblique muscle that has sidelined the Green and White’s quarterback since Oct. 30.</a></p>
      <p>“We had him do limited stuff, but he was able to throw with the team and move around well,” Dickenson said after Thursday’s closed practice at Mosaic Stadium. “We’ll have to look at the film to get a better idea, but all signs point that he will be good to go.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-making-progress-in-recovery-from-oblique-injury">Fajardo worked with the first-team offence during Wednesday’s practice, which was open to the media, and attempted some shorter passes.</a> He also played catch with receiver Shaq Evans, throwing approximately 15 passes in the range of 10 to 15 yards.</p>
      <p>“It felt good this morning,” Dickenson said. “Today was going to be a test day for him and so far he has passed the test.”</p>
      <p>Dickenson was pleased with his 27-year-old quarterback’s mobility on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We had some team situations and some situational football where we put the ones against the ones and he was moving around well,” Dickenson added “We’ll see how he feels (Thursday night) and Friday. Hopefully he feels good and he’s ready to go.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo, however, wasn’t available for comment after Thursday’s outdoor practice.</p>
      <p>Rookie quarterback Isaac Harker, who started in the Riders’ 23-13 win over the Edmonton Eskimos on Nov. 2 that clinched first place in the West Division for the Green and White, said that Fajardo is excited about the prospect of playing on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I know that he has been working hard to get back,” Harker said. “I’m sure that he’s anxious to see how it feels tomorrow because he threw today.”</p>
      <p>Evans’ status remains uncertain. The West Division all-star and the Riders’ leading receiver in yards (1,334) injured a toe in the win over the Eskimos.</p>
      <p>“We wanted him to practise and he did,” Dickenson said of Evans. “It looks like he’s moving around well. Now we just have to see how he feels.”</p>

        <b>FOOTBALL FORECAST</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Riders’ final full practice of the week is scheduled for Friday.</p>
      <p>Dickenson said it was likely they would practise outdoors as long as the weather is nice. Friday’s forecast calls for a high of minus-5 C, with wind gusts of 40 km-h. The practice is closed to the public but open to the media.</p>
      <p>Sunday’s forecast is for a high of plus-6 C with sunny breaks and winds from the south at 20 to 30 km-h, along with a 30-per-cent chance of precipitation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>EVANS UPDATE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Evans is expected to be a game-time decision on Sunday due to a toe injury he sustained in the regular-season finale.</p>
      <p>A West Division all-star, Evans caught 72 passes for 1,334 yards and five TDs during the regular season.</p>
      <p>Evans dressed for Wednesday’s practice, but his participation was limited. Some progress was noted on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We wanted him to practise and he did,” Dickenson said. “It looks like he’s moving around well. Now we just have to see how he feels.”</p>
      <p>Kenny Stafford would likely get the start if Evans is unavailable.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LAVOIE RETURN?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fullback Patrick Lavoie, a veteran of seven CFL campaigns, could be on the active roster for Sunday’s game.</p>
      <p>Lavoie hasn’t appeared in a game this season due an undisclosed injury that he suffered early in the pre-season.</p>
      <p>“He’s eligible to play,” Dickenson said. “If he feels like he can contribute and add something to the team, we’ll play him. It will be a game-time decision.”</p>
      <p>If Lavoie is activated, he would likely bump Albert Awachie or Kienan LaFrance from the roster.</p>
