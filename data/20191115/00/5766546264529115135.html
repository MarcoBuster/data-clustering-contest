      <p>In an Interview with the VOA’s Daybreak Africa Friday, Senator Dillon expressed fear that from the look of things there are possibilities that the constitution will be violated because according to him preparations for the 2020 senatorial elections are yet to begin.<br/><br/>Dillon who is in the United States holding Town-Hall meetings with Liberians living in the US said: “Our work with our people will determine whether you will win elections I want to work for my people and leave the decision with them.”<br/><br/>Recently, Finance and Development Planning Minister Samuel Tweah, expressed doubt about sourcing money to fund the 2020 Special Senatorial Elections, promising that money generated as civil servants’ salary will not be used to fund the electoral process.<br/><br/>Appearing on state radio (ELBC) on Monday, November 4, Minister Samuel Tweah said the Government will not affect its already struggling payroll to fund elections as much as the election is important.<br/><br/>“We will have elections but that means we will have to find the money to do that. We are working on a lot of ways for money to come in. If some of those monies come in, it will be used to fund elections. Elections funding is a major process. We could rephrase some of the budget line items so the money that should be going to agriculture in the budget will be affected.”<br/><br/>Fifteen senators are expected to go for re-election in 2020 in keeping with Constitution. Minister Tweah was careful not to state the amount of money needed for the elections but confirmed it will cost a lot of money.<br/>Senator Dillon says it is becoming increasing likely that the government may not be ready to conduct elections. “From the look of things, we may be violating our constitution again in 2020 by not conducting elections on time. I want to state on the records if we reach October of 202 and the government attempts to violate the constitution by not hold election in the name of “No money”. If that happens, I will resign as senator because I don’t want to sit one day outside of the constitution and if the Government sees it fit to hold elections subsequently I will be on the ballot but I will sit one–day outside the constitution.”<br/><br/>Senator Dillon said a government with vision would begin to prepare for next year elections. “When you have by-elections from the cause of death those are unexpected but when the constitution sets the time frame for elections like 202 we must prepare for those elections beginning now. We need to start mobilizing the Elections Commission beginning now rather than wait until now.”<br/><br/>For Senator Dillon, the argument that there is no emergency that warrant the President requesting the legislature to return holds no water. According to him printing additional money is not an emergency and he does not support doing so because there has not been proper accountability for the previous monies printed and used to mop up the economy.<br/><br/>He also criticized the country Judiciary System by describing it as “weak Judicial System” and blame it for the slowdown in investors’ interest to come to Liberia and invest in the country’s economy.</p>
