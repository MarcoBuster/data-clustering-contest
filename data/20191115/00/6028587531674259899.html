      <p>A vast majority of large U.S. corporations, including nearly all of the 500 largest, <a href="https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdfs/BigBusinessBias.pdf">have made payouts</a> in at least one employment discrimination or harassment lawsuit since 2000. The settlements at those 500 alone carried a cost of nearly $2 billion—that we know of, because a majority have terms protected by confidentiality clauses. Some companies, like Bank of America, have paid <a href="https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdfs/BigBusinessBias.pdf">north of $200 million</a> to settle these suits. But according to a new report, the high cost of this litigation has an unexpected upside: it can improve gender and racial equality at the companies in question.In the study, Elizabeth Hirsh of University of British Columbia and Youngjoo Cha of Indiana University analyzed 171 high-profile lawsuits filed against publicly traded companies from 1997 to 2008 and examined whether the verdicts and settlements led to measurable gains in gender and racial diversity in managerial representation. Hirsh and Cha compared the percentage of women and minorities before lawsuit and three years later. (They only looked at the percentages for white women and black men and women because they found that there were not enough Hispanic and Asian people in management positions to get “accurate results.”) </p>
      <p>They found that discrimination lawsuits involving sex, race, color or national origin produced “measurable gains” in representation across all of the groups they studied. White women saw the most gains pre- and post-lawsuit, with the representation increasing from an average of 18.7% to 21.8%. Because of the already low rate of representation of black men and women in management, the change increased 10% for women and 13% for men. However, even with those increases, black men only held 3.4% of management positions and black women held 2.3%. The changes were statistically significant and could only be attributed to the lawsuit, not the economy, chance, or other company factors, according to the study.</p>
      <p>In a Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/do-lawsuits-improve-gender-and-racial-equality-at-work">article</a>, Hirsh shared how shareholder and media response, monetary payouts and policy change mandates impacted the results. When lawsuits caused negative stock returns, companies increased their management-level diversity more than cases in which the lawsuits didn’t decrease the share price. The gains were more significant when the lawsuits that affected the stock and also attracted national media coverage. “The reason is simple: Shareholder value and corporate image matter,” Hirsh wrote, “When stock prices drop and the media take notice, corporations respond with diversity-enhancing measures. On the other hand, if lawsuits escape the notice of shareholders and the media, corporate leaders feel less pressure to take action on managerial diversity.” </p>
      <p>When the lawsuits required companies to develop specific diversity goals for hiring and promoting women and minorities and made executives or department managers accountable for the goals, gains were larger than lawsuits that didn’t mandate policy changes or only asked for what the researchers called “symbolic” policies. They found that policies like diversity training or making people aware of Equal Employment Opportunity practices didn’t have an impact and, in some cases, decreased diversity.</p>
      <p>You might think that cases with the highest settlements would be more likely to increase the representation of women and minorities in leadership positions in the years to follow, but the researchers found the opposite. Cases that settled for half a million dollars or more actually had fewer diverse people in management than companies that paid a lower settlement, or none at all. Why? Hirsh thinks it is because “costly payouts can put corporate leaders on the defensive, leading them to retaliate against the very groups that brought the suit and to avoid hiring other members of the group as a litigation-prevention strategy. And because financial settlements typically don’t involve admissions of wrongdoing, plaintiffs walk away without any acknowledgement that their experiences were discriminatory.”  </p>
      <p>Executives should increase management diversity because it is the right thing to do, but it is notable that the ramifications of discrimination lawsuits do lead to change.</p>
