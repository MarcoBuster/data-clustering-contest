      <p>Nigeria’s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/05/fg-orders-telecommunications-companies-to-reduce-data-cost-immediately/"><u><b>, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantam</b></u></a><b>i</b> has asked all telecommunication companies to quit the automatic activation of the voicemail service on their platforms.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands that Pantami said telcos were exploiting the consumers financially by putting them automatically on voicemail service instead of making it optional.</p>
      <p>A statement by the Minister’s spokesperson, Mrs. Uwa Suleiman, which quoted Pantami, described the trend as “financial exploitation by Mobile Network Operators”.</p>
      <p>According to the Minister, the practice has gained momentum in recent times, hence the order to stop with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>“<i>The Voicemail service should be accessed at the discretion of the subscriber and not by default.”</i></p>
