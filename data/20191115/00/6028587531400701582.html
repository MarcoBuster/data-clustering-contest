      <p>From now until the start of 2020, there will be dozens of party invitations thrown your way. Just like your holiday party outfits will likely be colorful and festive, have fun with your makeup looks this holiday season and add some sparkle! Here are three ways to step up your beauty game for all your holiday occasions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>STEP ONE: Get Glowing</b>
      </p>
      <p>A shimmering highlighter is a wonderful way to make your skin shine.</p>

      <p>A gorgeous highlighter is a great way to make a beauty look stand out. Charlotte Tilbury has quite a few great highlighter options, but this duo kit makes it easy to get that natural glisten. First use the Wonderglow primer for that lit-from-within glow, while the Beauty Light Wand highlighter is an easy way to accentuate your cheek and brow bones.</p>

      <p>Who says your face is the only thing that needs attention? Give your whole body a glow up with a shimmer oil like this one from SOL Body. The formula is smooth and the perfect amount of sparkle. You’ll look like you just came back from a tropical vacation no matter the time of year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>STEP TWO: Let Your Eyes Sparkle</b>
      </p>
      <p>All that glitters <i>is</i> golden when it comes to eye makeup during the holiday season!</p>

      <p>These glittery eyeshadows would make the Sugarplum Fairy proud! Blushing pinks and champagne hues are great for holiday events, and you can use the pink tones as blush as well. The lightest pink works as a highlighter, too! Essentially you will be using all these pigments for your makeup this winter.</p>

      <p>A swipe of glitter eyeliner is so fun for when you want to add some metallics but don’t want to go too overboard, and everyone needs a great mascara that builds volume and definition without clumping up. Not only will this set be your go-to for all your holiday parties, but it is also a great set to gift to friends during the holiday season.</p>

      <p>A liquid eyeshadow formula is a great option for when you want to keep it simple, but don’t call this eyeshadow boring. It is perfectly shimmery and works well for both day and night. Also, you cannot beat that beautiful packaging.</p>

      <p>For a major <i>Euphoria</i>-inspired makeup moment, look no further than Lemonhead’s ultra-pigmented glitter jellies. Before the paste dries, you can move the glitter perfectly into place and create some really cool designs, or just dab a finger over your eyelids and cheeks for an ethereal sparkle. Once it dries, the glitter will last throughout the night!</p>
      <p>
        <b>STEP THREE: Add A Pop Of Color</b>
      </p>
      <p>A colorful lip or touch of bright color on the eyes is just the thing to take your makeup look to the next level.</p>

      <p>For a creamy, luscious formula with pigmented color, you’ll adore Chanel’s Rouge Allure collection. I’m partial to the rich berry color of “Rouge Majestueux”, but you can also rock the formula in a saturated orange, peach pink, and bright red.</p>

      <p>Get your disco diva on with this lipstick from NARS. Not only is the sparkly purple packaging incredibly pleasing, but the actual lipstick itself is a perfect bright red for Christmastime. Swipe this shade on your lips and let that be the center of attention, or up the ante with a disco-inspired smokey eye for maximal glamour.</p>
