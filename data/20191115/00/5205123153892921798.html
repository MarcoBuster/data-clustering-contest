      <p>Brian Hamilton was found slumped over his backpack and unresponsive in the A&amp;E department of Tallaght Hospital in April last year, and was only checked on when a couple, who were waiting to be seen, raised the alarm, according to the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/man-lay-dead-ae-tallaght-20882881"><i><b>Irish Mirror</b></i></a>.</p>
      <p>Staff conducted CPR on the 40-year-old but he pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Nurse Jonathan Joaquin said: "They asked me to check the man sitting there and I did. I tried to rouse him, he didn’t answer me, there was no response and I went inside to get help.</p>
      <p>"He was seated on the bench, he was stooped forward, his face was on his backpack. I didn’t see any signs of life."</p>
      <p>CCTV footage showed Hamilton enter the hospital around 4am and approach the reception desk, however no one was there to speak with him.</p>
      <p>After waiting for around 30 seconds, he reportedly walked off in the direction of A&amp;E and sat down in the waiting area.</p>
      <p>Upon seeing his body, Brian's brother Michael spoke of how surprised he was that no one noticed his sibling for a number of hours.</p>
      <p>"When I saw Brian I was shocked.</p>
      <p>"It was clear he had been dead for four to five hours as rigor mortis had set in.</p>
      <p>"I was sure of this as I am a butcher by trade."</p>
      <p>It's been reported that Brian also had a sleeping bag with him, and nurses admitted that occasionally, rough sleepers will enter the hospital looking for shelter.</p>
