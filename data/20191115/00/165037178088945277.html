        <b>Striker, Luis Suarez was questioned by FC Barcelona's official media. The Uruguayan remembered his arrival at Barcelona, his best goal, his friendship with Messi and reviewed how the start of the season has gone.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-suarez-29685/">Luis Suarez</a> continues to be a fixed striker for Ernesto Valverde, and one of the predators of the club, as he is always looking for goals. The Uruguayan has already scored<b> eight goals in 13 games </b>and has had around 1,000 minutes of game time.</p>
      <p>"The football player is under constant pressure, but that's what we're here for. <b>When you arrive at </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona/">Barcelona,</a><b> you hope to win titles</b>, but there are also difficult moments that help you to grow and improve. You have to be prepared, not only on a physical level, but also on a mental one," he expressed.</p>
      <p>Regarding the more near future, Luis Suarez hopes for "a great month", then the year will finish with the postponed 'El Clasico'Â  and two Champions League duels.</p>
      <p><b>"We haven't had a simple start, we gave away points that other years we would not have lost</b>, but we know that the rest of the teams also compete. We hope to overcome it with the support of the fans, who have been there for a long time," he continued.</p>

      <p>Leo Messi and Luis Suarez are good friends, and this is why he was questioned on the striker:<b> "Everybody knows that he is the best in the world</b> and he has helped me a lot in my personal growth. We had a friendship from the start. He has shown me his companionship thousands of times and he helped me when I was fighting for the Ballon d'Or, even though he was as well."</p>
      <p>If he had to choose a favourite goal, Suarez picked two<b>: "I especially remember last season at Camp Nou against Atletico </b>because it was a sigh of relief for me, although the goal the other day against Sevilla was also good."</p>
