      <p>There’s no question that the legal cannabis industry took a hit recently. The <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/470514-better-regulations-not-bans-are-needed-to-curb-the-thc-vaping-crisis">vaping illness crisis</a> that transpired this summer and which studies showed were linked to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/potential-culprits-in-mystery-lung-illnesses-black-market-vaping-products/2019/09/24/cb5b708e-d98d-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html">black market vaping products</a>, dealt a damaging blow to consumer trust, resulting in sluggish sales, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-aurora-cannabis-stock-is-sinking-today-2019-11-14">sinking stocks</a> and layoffs.</p>

      <p>Despite these setbacks, the sector is continuing to boom as job growth is surging. According to cannabis recruiting company <a href="https://vangst.com/">Vangst</a>, which just released its 2019 annual salary guide, there was a 79% increase from 2018 to 2019 in total available job opportunities. In the three years spanning 2017 to 2020, the industry is projected to hit a job creation rate of 110%. By 2021, the U.S. cannabis industry is estimated to create 414,000 jobs. This is nearly twice the estimated 211,000 full-time employees who make up the legal cannabis industry this year.</p>
      <p>Other takeaways from the report include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On-demand talent, also known as seasonal employees or freelancers, are projected to make up about 40% of the average company’s workforce by 2020, both in and outside of the cannabis industry;</li>
        <li>Total economic impact of the cannabis industry will range from $39.2 billion to $48 billion in 2019, an approximate 35% increase over 2018;</li>
        <li>Hottest jobs in the industry include cultivation technicians, trimmers, budtenders, brand ambassadors, directors of cultivation and delivery drivers; and</li>
        <li>Companies offering dental and vision benefits increased by almost 15% from 2018, while the number of companies who offered no benefits decreased by 7.5%.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The report analyzes the industry by focusing on the four main verticals in the seed-to-sale process: cultivation, lab/extraction, manufacturing and retail. Each vertical is analyzed in even more depth, including the top jobs for each vertical, job descriptions, adjusted salary averages (based on experience and location/state) and a benefits overview.</p>
      <p>Another intriguing finding: cannabis jobs, salaries and benefits are on the rise for 2020. As with most jobs in the U.S., salaries for cannabis jobs fluctuate, according to the size and competitiveness of their respective markets. For instance, the report shows that average salaries for a director of cultivation runs the gamut from $59,800 to double that amount at $118,600. That type of salary discrepancy based on location can also be seen for a grow manager, which ranges from $43,400 to more than twice that figure at $93,400.</p>
      <p>Karson Humiston, CEO and founder of Vangst, said that industry staples like budtenders, trimmers and directors of cultivation are in continual demand. She also noted an increased interest for sales reps, delivery drivers and administrative/corporate roles.</p>
      <p>There was one area, though, that surprised her when it came to salaries. “Manufacturing positions are starting to offer some of the most lucrative opportunities in the industry,” said Humiston. “As companies continue to scale, the need for experienced manufacturing personnel becomes paramount. Before, companies placed a strong focus on cultivation and retail, but we’re excited to see the other sectors grow in response to the increased demand and interest in the industry.”</p>
