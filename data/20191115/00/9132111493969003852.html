      <p>Former Central Regional Chairman of the National Democratic Congress Bernard Allotey Jacobs has indicated that the stance taken by his party with respect to the upcoming referendum is not surprising.</p>
      <p>"There are two devils at both sides walking in the shadows. If the result of the referendum is 'Yes'; it is an endorsement of Akufo-Addo's government, so don’t be surprised if the NDC wants a 'No' vote because a 'No' vote goes to the benefit of the NDC," he said.</p>
      <p>The National Democratic Congress (NDC) is urging Ghanaians to vote a 'NO' during the December 17, 2019, national referendum.</p>
      <p>According to the party, a 'YES' vote will further polarise the nation, particularly local communities along the lines of NPP-NDC, and will likely lead to the creation of “NDC Communal Labour day” and “NPP Communal Labour day”, as well as “NDC market” and “NPP market”.</p>
      <p>"At the meeting held last Thursday, the NEC of the NDC affirmed our long-held position that MMDCEs should be elected. We, however, took the view that the local government system should remain non-partisan and that individuals contest the District Assembly and Unit Committee elections on their own merit."</p>
      <p>"We, therefore, decided to campaign for a 'NO' vote at the referendum and to urge all Ghanaians to vote 'NO' at the referendum," the NDC indicated.</p>
      <p>Allotey Jacobs who was speaking on Peace FM's morning show 'Kokrokoo' however predicted that it is "unlikely for No" to emerge with majority votes.</p>
