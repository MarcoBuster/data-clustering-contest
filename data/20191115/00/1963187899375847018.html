      <p>MADRID - 15 November 2019: La Liga's hopes of staging Villarreal's game with Atletico Madrid on Dec. 6 in Miami have ended after a local court declined a request to grant an injunction against the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF), who oppose playing the match abroad. <br/><br/>The league's organizing body filed a complaint against the RFEF last year over the latter's refusal to authorize playing regular season matches abroad, claiming the RFEF did not have the authority to block the move. <br/><br/>That complaint will be heard next February. <br/><br/>"Madrid's Mercantile Court No. 12 today decided not to grant interim measures to stage an official La Liga match in Miami in a case about the pending authorization from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF)," said a statement from La Liga. <br/><br/>"La Liga respects this decision, which does not prejudge the substance of the matter, which will be permanently settled in February 2020. Staging an official match abroad is part of a long-term La Liga strategy for international growth. <br/><br/>"We hope that from February La Liga will be able to organize an official match beyond Spanish borders." <br/><br/>This is the second time the league has been unsuccessful in its bid to play regular season matches abroad, after Barcelona withdrew from plans to play a league game last January against Girona in Miami, citing a lack of support.</p>
