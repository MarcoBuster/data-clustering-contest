        <b>Dutch-led investigators of the downing of the 2014 flight MH17 over Ukraine have published a series of phone intercepts, among them one between former senior Kremlin official and pro-Kremlin separatists rebels blamed for the crash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>British-Canadian news agency Reuters reports that calls between officials in Moscow and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine mostly took place via secure telephones provided by the Russian security service, and intensified ahead of the disaster in the first half of July 2014, the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has stated.</p>
      <h3>«The indications for close ties between leaders of the DPR (Donetsk People’s Republic) and Russian government officials raise questions about their possible involvement in the deployment of the (missile), which brought down flight MH17 on 17 July 2014,»</h3>
      <p>the JIT said on Thursday, November 14, about the tragedy of 298 civilians killed.</p>
      <p>The Dutch-led team said the intercepts showed two leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), who were charged with murder in June, had been in contact with Vladislav Surkov, a former deputy Prime Minister of Russia, and Sergey Aksyonov, a Russian-appointed leader in Russian-annexed Crimea.</p>
      <p>The Kremlin, which has denied involvement in the plane’s destruction, commented on Thursday it could not verify the authenticity of the intercepts.</p>
      <h3>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a news briefing in Moscow that the intercepts followed a wave of «fake news» on the subject and should be regarded with scepticism.</h3>
