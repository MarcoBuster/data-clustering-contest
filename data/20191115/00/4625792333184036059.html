      <h1>'They chose life': GOP congressman tells story of how his staffer was almost aborted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:14:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:14</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Pearce</a></address>
      <p>Rep. Chip Roy relayed a story about one of his staffers as evidence that abortion can kill a life that otherwise would have been "excellent."</p>
      <p>The Texas Republican used part of his time during a House <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/medical-expert-patient-and-advocates-to-testify-on-state-efforts-to-undermine">hearing</a> on state abortion laws on Thursday to tell the story of one of his staffers, Jonah. Jonah’s parents dismissed their doctor’s recommendation that they abort him and his twin during pregnancy.</p>
      <p>"In the winter of 1996, a couple went in for a checkup. They were excited. They were recently informed they had twins," the 47-year-old lawmaker said.</p>
      <p>The routine checkup turned worrisome after the doctor conducted more and more tests, he said. The doctor diagnosed the unborn twins with cystic fibrosis, a potentially fatal disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. The doctor said the babies would likely die just hours after birth.</p>
      <p>"'I would recommend termination,' said the doctor. The couple said the first thing that came into their mind, 'No,' and walked out. They chose life," Roy said.</p>
      <p>"Those twins would grow up to become excellent men. I know this because Jonah works for me. Right here. He is one of my staffers," Roy said.</p>
