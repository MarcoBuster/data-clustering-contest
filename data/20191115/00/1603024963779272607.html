      <h1>WeWork bond drops, spread hits a record on report of delayed share tender</h1>
      <h2>Japan's SoftBank Corp has yet to commence the tender offer that was part of a $9.5 billion rescue package for the money-losing shared-office operator</h2>

      <p>WeWork's junk bond price dropped and its risk premium shot to a record high on November 14 following a report that its main backer still hasn't delivered on a plan to buy $3 billion of stock from existing shareholders.</p>
      <p>The Real Deal, citing anonymous sources, said Japan's SoftBank Corp has yet to commence the tender offer that was part of a $9.5 billion rescue package for the money-losing shared-office operator.</p>
      <p>An investor who requested anonymity confirmed to Reuters that there have been delays, but he had no more details.</p>

      <p>"(The delays) will likely be resolved," the investor said in a text, asking not to be named because the discussions between investors and SoftBank were confidential. "Lots of anxiety."</p>
      <p>The We Company, the owner of WeWork, told bondholders on November 13 that net losses in the third quarter more than doubled to $1.25 billion as it added a record number of desks to its global network but was unable to control rising costs.</p>
      <p>SoftBank agreed in October to the rescue package that would result in it owning almost 78 percent of WeWork if the tender were fully subscribed, according to a presentation to bondholders reviewed by Reuters.</p>
      <p>The tender was supposed to have begun five business days after an initial payment of $1.5 billion to WeWork was in place, The Real Deal said, citing a letter from SoftBank to WeWork investors.</p>
      <p>The payment was made on October 30, but sources told the publication that no tender offer has been extended.</p>
      <p>WeWork's 7.875 percent note due in May 2025 fell 2.25 cents on the dollar to a bid of 74 cents, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>The bond now yields a record 15.02 percent and its spread, a measure of the premium investors demand for the added risk of holding WeWork's bond rather than safer securities like US Treasury debt, widened to a record 13.40 percentage points.</p>
      <p>Losses have widened at WeWork as costs have outpaced the company's breakneck expansion, which new management aims to curb after a disastrous effort to go public was shelved in September.</p>
      <p>A pipeline of existing leasing commitments suggests WeWork's rapid growth will likely continue into 2020.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
