      <p>Earlier this week, <i>Norwegian Encore </i>made its debut in New York City before heading to its Miami homeport. The 17th ship in the Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) fleet, she is the last of four in the Breakaway Class, which includes her sister ships: <i>Norwegian Escape, Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Joy.</i><i>Norwegian Encore</i> is a mega-ship in every respect: Big, bold, and beautiful—-exceptional in terms of contemporary design and decor. The light palette, complemented by museum-quality contemporary artwork throughout the ship, is positively breathtaking.</p>
      <p>More than 1094 feet long (about the length of three football fields), <i>Encore</i> can accommodate almost 4000 passengers with 1735 crew. When it is docked, it has the feel of a sprawling resort with dozens of specialty restaurants, bars, lounges, entertainment venues and activity options for travelers of every age. </p>

      <p>But remarkably, it also offers a perfect berth for those who covet a small-ship, boutique cruising experience.</p>
      <h3>The Haven: A boutique ship within a ship  </h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Tucked at the bow of <i>Encore’s </i>upper decks (Deck 17 &amp; 18) is The Haven: a small, private enclave, almost like a members-only gated community (Haven guests are given platinum keycards to access the complex). </p>
      <p>In addition to occupying its own geographical niche at the front of the ship, The Haven is an all-suite “ship within a ship” whose scale, intimacy and refined ambiance rivals that of the most luxurious ships at sea. An air of exclusivity and privilege pervades every aspect of this cruise experience.</p>
      <p>The major perks of The Haven are upscale accommodations, exclusive access to private areas, and bespoke service:</p>
      <h3>Upscale accommodations</h3>
      <p>The Haven encompasses 80 all-suite staterooms in eight different categories, ranging in size from romantic, two-person Spa Suites (about 339-343 square feet) to opulent, six-person, 1,458-square-foot Owner’s Suites. </p>
      <p>Fifty of these staterooms are located within the complex and 30 are located outside but all afford full privileges to The Haven amenities. Those cabins located at the bow and aft of the ship afford sweeping, unobstructed views of the ocean.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>All of the staterooms are beautifully appointed with soothing colors, eye-catching artwork and attention to small details. Think: Hans Grohe bathroom fittings; fine linens, pillow-top mattresses, plush bathrobes, oversized towels, L’Occitane toiletries, in-room coffee bars with Nespresso machines and evening snacks delivered to your cabin.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Akin to the atmosphere of a private members-only club, Haven guests have exclusive access to a private courtyard area with its own pool, sundeck, hot tub and fitness area, all with attendants. Although this sanctuary is limited to those ages 16 and above, young people generally prefer and tend to gravitate to other areas of the ship.</p>
      <p>The inviting all-weather pool area has a retractable roof where guests can read, nap or work (if they must) on comfortable chairs and recliners, or even relax on curvaceous lounges placed in the water.</p>

      <p>The two-story Horizon lounge offers expansive ocean views in a low-density setting. Drinks and light snacks are available throughout the day. The lounge also has a small library.</p>

      <p>In a class of its own in terms of its quality, creative dishes and beautiful presentation, the restaurant menu changes daily; it’s open for breakfast, lunch and dinner with an open-air balcony available for alfresco dining. Of course, The Haven guests can also have meals delivered to their staterooms.</p>

      <h3>Bespoke service</h3>
      <p>Haven guests are afforded priority, skip-the-line status from the moment they embark on the ship whether it’s snagging reservations or boarding tenders to shore.<b> </b>Although service is personalized and solicitous, it is also non-obtrusive.</p>
      <p>Someone who knows your name is always around ready to help. A dedicated concierge desk has crew ready to assist guests in booking dining reservations, VIP seats for shows and shore excursions. Trained butlers are assigned to each Haven suite and are available to guests 24/7.</p>
      <h3>A yacht-like experience with the advantages of a large cruise ship</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Even people who love the bucolic countryside relish visits to the big city to take advantage of the plethora of available dining and lively entertainment options. Similarly, The Haven guests literally have all the excitement of everything else that people love about big, bustling ships<i> </i>at their doorsteps (on Decks 6, 7 and 8). </p>
      <p>In fact, The Haven is a perfect solution for multigenerational or skip-gen family getaways because grandparents or parents can cocoon in The Haven while younger generations can make their home in other staterooms outside the complex, allowing quality time apart and quality time together. It’s also a great alternative for couples without children and solo travelers who want to splurge on themselves.</p>

      <p>In addition to the casino, spa services, multitude of specialty restaurants, entertainment venues and gathering places, some of the new innovations to the Breakaway Class ships found on <i>Encore</i> include:</p>
      <p><b>Dining at Onda at Scarpetta:</b> This new specialty restaurant is the first, at-sea outpost of this critically-acclaimed NYC Italian ristorante (with other locations in the Hamptons, Miami, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Newport and London, is operated in partnership with <a href="http://www.ldvhospitality.com/">LDV Hospitality</a>. Designed by <a href="https://www.studiodado.com/">Studio DADO</a>, it embraces the concept of a high-energy “public version of a dinner party.” The arches in the room evoke the aqueducts of ancient Rome, framing the natural decor that includes rich calacatta marble and walnut woods.       </p>

      <p><b>Adrenalin-raising go-kart riding</b>: Thrill rides aren’t for kids only: They are just as much fun for kids at heart. If you are brave enough to put your foot to the pedal and navigate hairpin turns at 20 MPH, the ship’s bi-level Speedway is the longest go-kart racing track at sea (1,100 feet), part of it suspended 13 feet over the ship’s hull.</p>

      <p><b>Feel good about the ship’s sustainability: </b>As part of a fleet-wide commitment to sustainability, Encore is the first ship on which NCL has introduced <a href="https://justwater.com/">JUST Water</a>, plant-based, 100% spring water cartons to replace all plastic bottles.</p>
