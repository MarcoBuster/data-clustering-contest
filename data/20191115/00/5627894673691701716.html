      <p>WASHINGTON - While the impeachment hearings into President Trumps conduct with Ukraine played out live, the presidents long-time ally Roger Stone was found guilty on all seven counts against him of witness tampering and lying to Congress. <br/><br/>He is the sixth Trump aide or adviser to be convicted of charges brought as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. <br/><br/>Stone has denied wrongdoing and consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated. He did not take the stand during the trial and his lawyers did not call any witnesses in his defense. <br/><br/>Stone, 67, showed no visible reaction as the verdict was read aloud, count by count. He's scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 6. He could face up to 20 years. Another former Trump campaign aide, Michael Caputo, was removed by the courtroom by security officers after he turned his back on the jury after the verdict was read. <br/><br/>Stone smirked at reporters as he left the courtroom, holding hands with his wife. As he walked out of the courthouse, Stone was asked if he had any comment on the verdict and replied: "none whatsoever" before he hopped into a waiting SUV with his wife. <br/><br/>Trump tweeted minutes after the verdict, calling the conviction "a double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country," because his frequent nemeses, including Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey and "including even Mueller himself," have not been convicted. "Didn't they lie?"</p>
