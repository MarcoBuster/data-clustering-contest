      <p>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A man who authorities say is a member of a southern New Jersey/Philadelphia crime family has been sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison for possessing drugs and staging a robbery at a pawnshop.</p>
      <p>Salvatore “Sam” Piccolo must also pay $174,025 in restitution as part of the 150-month sentence he received Thursday. The 68-year-old Atlantic City man had pleaded guilty to drug distribution and wire fraud charges.</p>
