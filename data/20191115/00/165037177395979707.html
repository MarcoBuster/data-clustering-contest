      <p><b>"It is a priviledge to be in the 'top 5'</b> goalscorers at the best club in the world, a club that has so much history. When I arrived at Bar√ßa, I was fulfilling a dream. I wanted to enjoy it with my team-mates. I didn't think it would come to this," he confessed.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he higlighted his special connection with Camp Nou. "People know that I never give up and value my work, the insistence I put in each game," he said.</p>
