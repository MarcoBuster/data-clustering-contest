      <p>Given a few months to live released a creative gush in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-henry/">Joe Henry</a> and the result is “The Gospel According to Water,” one of the best albums of his fruitful career.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-henry/">Henry</a>’s cancer is in remission while he continues to get treatment and his 15th solo studio album is being released a year to the day of his diagnosis.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-henry/">Henry</a>’s production work has won him three Grammys but, as the proverb says, sometimes it’s the shoemaker who wears the worst shoes. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-henry/">Henry</a> proves it wrong by making a wise choice regarding his own work and leaving the 13 songs, which he initially viewed as demos, as stark and direct as they were recorded.</p>
      <p>Accompanying himself on guitar, the sparse but supportive backing comes from the likes of son Levon on sax and clarinet, guitarist John Smith and Patrick Warren on keyboards.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-henry/">Henry</a> sings with his usual expressiveness but without exaggerating and doesn’t consider the songs “dark in nature” despite their time of origin, but rather a reflection of “gratitude, compassion to self” and being in love with life.</p>
      <p>This is evident on tunes like the title track, “In Time for Tomorrow,” “Book of Common Prayer” and “Bloom” - songs that sound, at times, as if they could have been on Bob Dylan’s “Blood on the Tracks” had it been his reconciliation album instead of divorce.</p>
      <p>Though there are concentrated mentions of death and prayers, one of the words heard most often is “light.”</p>

        <p>Those who believe in miracles and trust in music’s healing power may consider the outstanding “The Gospel According to Water” as a pilgrimage, but even the skeptics and agnostics will be stirred by the depth and beauty of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-henry/">Joe Henry</a>’s songs.</p>
