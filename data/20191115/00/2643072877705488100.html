      <p><b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/daddy-freeze/"><u>Daddy Freeze</u></a></b> has reacted to the court’s dismissal of the rape allegations levied against Pastor <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/biodun-fatoyinbo/"><u>Biodun Fatoyinbo</u></a></b> of COZA by <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/busola-dakolo/"><u>Busola Dakolo</u></a></b>, the wife of singer, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/timi-dakolo/"><u><b>Timi Dakolo</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>The court had also ruled that Dakolo pay the sum of N1m as damages.</p>
      <p>Reacting, in a live video, Daddy Freeze told women not to go public with their rape allegations if they don’t have a good story.</p>
      <p>He said that he has 3 sons and don’t want them in jail because a woman has a story.</p>
      <p>Daddy Freeze said that he will never undermine the pain of a woman but won’t encourage putting a man in pain either, while adding that if one doesn’t have what it takes to nail an offender properly, they should <i>“shut up</i>” as it all amounts to <i>“audio doings”.</i></p>
