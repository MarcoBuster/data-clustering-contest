      <p>In the American version of the television mockumentary, <i>The Office</i>, regional manager Michael Scott (played by Steve Carell) gives this answer to an off-camera question.<i>“Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it’s not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.”</i></p>
      <p>For the first twenty years of my career, I was Michael Scott. And this turns out to be my single greatest weakness as a leader. Notice I use present tense. I’m a recovering people-pleaser. It’s something I’ll always need to manage, to be wary of.</p>
      <p>I used to be the boss who couldn’t just tell you that your performance was falling short. I once let a simple tweak to the organizational chart spiral into six months of “got-a-minute” requests from every employee who feared who their new boss might be, and every boss who wanted to build their empire. I’ve actually quit jobs powerful well-paying jobs that, looking back, I could salvaged with a tough, honest emotional conversations with my manager.</p>
      <h3>We All Want To Be Liked</h3>
      <p>Everyone except people with severe psychological disorders has an inner need to be liked and accepted. Have you ever met anyone who would rather be disliked by everyone? In Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, just after our physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, we have the need for interpersonal belonging (affiliation, acceptance, affection). It’s probably an evolutionary instinct. After all, if our fellow cavemen don’t like us we could be voted out of the cave and become dinner for saber tooth tigers.</p>
      <p>And even in these modern times we are raised with high value on friendship and friendliness. As children we are told to share our toys, stop arguing, and don’t pull Jenny’s pigtail. As teens our emotional radar pings madly in the high school cafeteria…tray in our hands, eyes darting. <i>Which table should I sit at? Where are my friends? Will I be rejected if I sit with that group? Oh no, I’m sitting alone—I’m such a loser!</i></p>
      <h3>So Why Is Being Liked A Problem?</h3>
      <p>The distinction is subtle but critical. <i>Being </i>liked isn’t a problem. It’s your <i>need</i> to be liked that is a problem.</p>
      <p>In a friendship, your relationship isn’t tied to anything other than the pleasure of the social interaction itself. But when you’re the boss, your relationship with a subordinate is about achieving specific goals. It’s also about managing their performance, including giving constructive criticism, deciding on their performance review and raise, and supporting them (or not) for career advancement. In my own experience, a desire to be everyone’s friend—a <i>need</i> to be liked—leads to two big problems.</p>
      <h3>Problem #1: Poor Decision Making</h3>
      <p>Only in Silicon Valley can you start a company, grow it into something huge, be worth over $2 billion dollars and still be seen as a failure. But that’s exactly what numerous venture capitalists and tech industry insiders think of Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang who is faulted for being way “too nice.” (You know, the opposite of acknowledged jerks like Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer and Jeff Bezos.)</p>
      <p>The thesis is that Yang should have laid off employees to save money, but he didn’t because he was too nice. They say Yahoo was strategically confused; it should have been either a media company or a tech company, but Yang tried to be both because he couldn’t make the hard decision which would have affected half the company. When Microsoft and Google came courting with huge buyout offers, he refused them, because he was too nice to do that to his employees.</p>
      <p>As venture capitalist Mark Suster wrote in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/great-leaders-are-respected-not-loved-2010-5">his analysis</a> of Yang and Yahoo’s demise,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Tough decisions don’t always make you friends. By default if it’s a ‘tough’ decision some people will think you made the wrong one. And when it means a change in somebody’s power, money or stature – or canceling a project that somebody has poured 18 months of their lives into – you’re not going to be popular. Bad leaders want to be loved too much and their companies (or countries) suffer.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The potential problem for those who have a need to be liked—again I’m looking in the mirror as I say that—is that these types of decisions can be skewed by your personal feelings towards your “friends,” or they take forever to make as you try to get everyone to consensus. </p>
      <h3>Problem #2: Avoiding Tough Conversations</h3>
      <p>Similar to making tough decisions, managers who have a compulsive need to be liked are notorious for putting off tough conversations. Whether it’s giving someone constructive criticism or having to mediate a dispute between two employees, conflict avoidance only makes matters worse. Tension rises and things are left to fester. Usually, exceptional talent will actually leave a company with this type of dysfunctional culture.</p>
      <p>If you are unsure about whether your conflict-avoidant or not, consider these questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How frequently do you give constructive feedback to your team members?</li>
        <li>Do you often give people the benefit of the doubt for sub-standard work?</li>
        <li>When it comes to annual performance ratings, if you had to round a score up or down, which would you lean toward?</li>
        <li>How would you feel if you confronted one of your team members and in reaction she started crying or yelling?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Be Likable, Not Liked</h3>
      <p>The solution to the very common need to be liked, isn’t to act like a jerk. There is no reason to be stern, to act aloof, or to be unemotional. Instead, just act likable, and be <i>unattached</i> to whether you are actually liked or not. It’s hard but these days I can usually resist the need to be liked by replacing it with my need to <i>lead right</i>.  I remember that my need to be liked is coming from a place of ego, and that a truly selfless act is to focus on the pursuit of my company’s mission and goals, within the confines of my values.</p>
