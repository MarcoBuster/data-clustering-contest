      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - A Kentucky radio host returned to the airwaves after a hiatus to announce he won’t enter the race to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-jones/">Matt Jones</a> left his popular sports talk show last week when the Kentucky Republican Party complained he was using it to promote his potential candidacy.</p>
      <p>On Friday he was back to say he is “not going to be a candidate for office.” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-jones/">Jones</a> says he has spent two years contemplating a foray into politics. He has been a critic of McConnell and is writing a book about the powerful six-term senator.</p>
