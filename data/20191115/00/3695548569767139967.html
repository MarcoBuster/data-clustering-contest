        <b>Red Bull Formula 1 boss Christian Horner says Alex Albon should not be blamed for crashing on a damp track in opening practice for the Brazilian Grand Prix.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Albon topped FP1 at Interlagos after setting the quickest time on intermediates but shunted at the penultimate corner as he prepared for a flying lap on slick tyres while conditions were still tricky.</p>
      <p>Though Horner joked it was "quite an expensive session" for Red Bull, he pointed out that Albon was not alone in making an error - as his Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen had only just avoided crashing with his own off at the Senna Esses at the start of the lap.</p>
      <p>"It started good, Alex, first time in Brazil, first time on the track, went fastest on the intermediates," said Horner.</p>
      <p>"And then the circuit looked like it was starting to get dry. I think there were 10 cars that went out on slicks.</p>
      <p>"Max went off at Turn 2. Alex, unfortunately, with cold brakes, he locked up in the last turn and put a bit of damage.<br/><br/>"So it's dented the mechanics lunch break, to get the car ready for the next session."</p>

      <p>Albon has been re-signed for Red Bull for 2020, when he will have a full season with the senior team after being promoted to replace Pierre Gasly midway through the current campaign.</p>
      <p>He has had several practice crashes this year at Toro Rosso and Red Bull, but when asked by Autosport if this was part of an unfortunate habit or just a result of the conditions, Horner said: "I think today you can't put on Alex's account.</p>
      <p>"Maybe we were a little bit too optimistic getting out there trying to get him laps in on a track that was still pretty damp in the middle sector.</p>
      <p>"And Max he had a moment at Turn 1 and Turn 2, there were other cars as well running wide.</p>
      <p>"I don't think today's [accident], we can blame that on on Alex.</p>
      <p>"He's had a few little incidents this year, thankfully they've all been on Fridays and Saturday mornings, and when it's come to it in qualifying and the race he's absolutely delivered."</p>
