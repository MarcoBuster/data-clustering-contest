      <h1>Foxtel Score Major NBC/Universal Content Deal As Questions Raised About Stan Showtime</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/dwr/" target="_blank">David Richards</a></address>
      <p>Foxtel has scored a new content deal with NBCUniversal, the owners of popular shows such as Law &amp; Order and movies such as The Fast and the Furious, Jurassic, Bourne and Jaws franchises, in addition to DreamWorks Animation titles.</p>
      <p>NBCU confirmed that they have completed a new, multi-year agreement covering movies, drama, comedy, entertainment, reality and news for the Foxtel Group’s broadcast, on demand and streaming platforms.</p>
      <p>The news comes as Stan is tipped to lose their Showtime partnership next year.</p>
      <p>The agreement includes premiere Australian subscription rights for movies from Universal Pictures and a significantly expanded range of titles from the studio’s rich library of blockbusters and evergreen classics.</p>
      <p>Foxtel will continue to reimagine its channel offering with NBCU’s highly popular channels – Universal TV, E! and business news channel CNBC.  Universal TV will join Foxtel’s new FOX Crime channel in providing an extraordinary line up of crime and procedural drama including multiple series in the Law &amp; Order and Chicago franchises.  Together with E! and Foxtel’s ARENA, Foxtel’s position will be cemented as the number one destination for reality and Hollywood news with hugely popular franchises such as E!’s Keeping Up with the Kardashians and The Real Housewives from Bravo.</p>

      <p>The new agreement will also see NBCU continue as a major provider of scripted content for Foxtel’s expanded line-up of FOX-branded channels and on demand platforms.  This includes complete seasons of some of the most popular sitcoms for FOX Funny and FOX Hits including The Office, 30 Rock and Parks and Recreation. The deal also brings Foxtel first run rights to US blockbuster series Chicago P.D. which will premiere on FOX One on November 15.</p>
      <p>NBCU will also provide thousands of additional hours of on demand content including movies and both Bravo’s popular reality series and scripted box sets, initially available through the New Foxtel Experience on iQ3s and iQ4s and through Foxtel NOW. These will be joined by season five of locally commissioned hit reality series The Real Housewives of Melbourne, currently in pre-production with NBCU International Studios’ Matchbox Pictures and due on Foxtel screens exclusively in Australia next year.</p>
