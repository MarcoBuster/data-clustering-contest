      <p>WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Hundreds of people have been screened for tuberculosis after possible exposure to a patient recently diagnosed with the contagious disease.</p>
      <p>Lexington Medical Center spokeswoman Jennifer Wilson says more than 300 free screenings have been completed on people who possibly came into contact with the Lexington Oncology Infusion Center patient between August and September. Citing a statement by Wilson, news outlets report none of the screenings conducted by the center and the state have come back positive so far.</p>
      <p>The infusion center is a physician practice on the medical center system’s West Columbia campus and is not inside the main campus building.</p>
