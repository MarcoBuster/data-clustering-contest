        <b>ICICI Direct's research report on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/media-entertainment/entertainmentnetworkindia/ENI">Entertainment Network India</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>ENIL’s revenues came in at Rs 115.6 crore, down 5.7% YoY, impacted by core radio revenues that de-grew ~17% YoY while solutions business grew ~34% YoY. Reported EBITDA came in at Rs 28 crore while margins came in at 24.2%. Adjusted for Ind-AS, EBITDA was at Rs 17.9 crore, down 34.5% YoY while adjusted margins came in at 15.5%, down 680 bps YoY on account of negative operating leverage. Reported PAT came in lower at Rs 0.2 crore, impacted by a weak operating performance, lower other income and Ind-AS impact. Without Ind-AS 116, PAT would have been Rs 2.9 crore.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hence, we maintain our HOLD rating with a revised DCF based target price of Rs 270, (implying ~6x FY21E EV/EBITDA). The target price cut is on account of weakness in revenues and earnings.</p>
