      <h1>Geingob wanted to fire Esau, Shanghala – Hengari</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">NYASHA FRANCIS NYAUNGWA</a></address>
      <p>Press Secretary in the Office of the President Dr Alfredo Hengari has revealed that President Hage Geingob had already written letters to dismiss disgraced ex-Justice Minister Sakeus Shanghala and former Fisheries and Marine Resources Minister Bernard Esau.</p>
      <p>Hengari told the Windhoek Observer on Thursday that Geingob wanted to fire the two former ministers as demonstration of his zero-tolerance for corruption.</p>
      <p>“The decision of the president was already taken that the continued tenure of the ministers in the executive would not be on the table. They offered to resign, which the president accepted. But the decision of the president was already taken and letters of relieve from their duties had been prepared to be served had they not taken by their accord, the decision to resign,” Hengari said.</p>
      <p>He said the president loathes corruption as it diverts scarce state resources.</p>
      <p>“The fight against corrupt has been in practice manifested by the decision of the president to cancel the inflated airport tender; the asset declaration of the president and that of the first lady.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday (Wednesday), the president demonstrated once again that there are consequences for any member of the executive who is implicated in forms of malpractice. You will recall that the president requested in 2018 four ministers to explain allegations of corruption made against them, and submitted the dossier to the ACC.”</p>
      <p>Hengari’s comments come as some comrades in the ruling SWAPO Party had expressed their unhappiness with how Geingob had handled graft allegations against Shanghala and Esau.</p>
      <p>Party sources said Wednesday that Geingob knew of the allegations against the two ex-cabinet ministers, but did not want to act until after the elections.</p>
      <p>Shanghala and Esau were forced to resign on Wednesday after media reports shed light on their alleged corrupt activities.</p>
      <p>Asked his views on whether the resignation of Shanghala and Esau would help boost the SWAPO Party and President Hage Geingob’s election campaign, a senior party official told the Windhoek Observer that he doesn’t see how the party can positively spin the graft scandal.</p>
      <p>“It would have been nice if we were proactive about it,” the senior official said. “There we rumours that the president wanted to fire the two after the elections, but now his hand has been forced. This is demoralising. We are out here in the field using our own resources to campaign for the party yet you have comrades with slush funds.”</p>
      <p>There were unsubstantiated rumours on Wednesday that some of the proceeds from the N$150 million in kickbacks from the fishing scandal might have been used to finance SWAPO’s election campaign.</p>
      <p>SWAPO Party Executive Director Austin Samupawo denied the existence of a slush fund, adding the party has adequate resources to finance its election campaign.</p>
      <p> “We don’t have such funds. Remember we have different sources of funding other than Treasury. We get funding from our own members and from our own companies,” Samupawo said.</p>
      <p>The Windhoek Observer reported earlier this month that Shanghala was a liability to President Hage Geingob who is facing stern opposition from Independent Presidential candidate Dr Panduleni Itula, in his bid for a second term in office.</p>
      <p>Political analyst Henning Melber said he doesn’t understand why Shanghala remained in office despite the long list of failures and shady deals that he has allegedly been involved in.</p>
      <p>Melber said President Hage Geingob should, as part of his election campaign, prove to the electorate that any minister involved in shady deals or who is accused of corruption is a liability for good governance and should not remain in any high office representing the state and government.</p>
      <p>“I would imagine that such an announcement with consequences taken now would be a smart and long overdue contribution to add more legitimacy to the constant claims that he is serious about fighting corruption and/or mishandling of public office,” Melber said of the president.</p>
      <p>“Shanghala would be a long-overdue example to document the seriousness of intentions. It makes one wonder what information he might have, which seems to make him almost untouchable.”</p>
      <p>University of Namibia Lecturer Ndumba Kamwanyah also opined that Shanghala was a liability, distraction, and posed a risk to the president's election campaign and administration.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps in politics, it works differently but if it was in the corporate world, any firm/company would have long dropped him. This is not to suggest that he is guilty of anything but merely stating that his name cropping up in every questionable deal this country has experienced cannot be an asset to anyone, let alone the president of the country,” he said. </p>
      <p>The political analyst said under normal circumstances, any person with a sense of self-worth and dignity would not wait to be dropped but would rather excuse her/himself to avoid being a distraction to the president's cause.</p>
      <p>“Certainly, if the president is serious about stamping out corruption, Sacky's questionable dealings are not something that can make him sleep.” – This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</p>
