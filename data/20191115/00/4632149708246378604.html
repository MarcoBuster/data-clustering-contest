Ashrith, a certified Ableton trainer, and Ashwin, a DJ since 2004, have produced a catalogue of music that meanders between deep house and techno. With two million plays on Spotify, and a plethora of original music to their credit, you’d never walk into a bar in <br/>the country that doesn’t play Audio Units on loop for hours. Given their illustrious career, they have shared the stage with Recondite, Richie Hawtin, Rampue, Petar Dundov, Drumcell, Paula Temple, Luca Bacchetti, Karmon, Above &amp; Beyond, Secret Cinema, Gab Rhome, Betoko, and other big names. <br/><br/><b>ANSWER After Hours </b><br/>You would have surely heard of ANSWER, a collaborative, EDM project by Arjun Nair and Nishanth Naidu.

All this and more make them Bengaluru’s top export to the world of music. <br/><br/><b>Tejas Belkond </b><br/>Growing up on the sounds of DJs and producers such as Mind Against, Karmon, Sonic Future, John Digweed, Hot Since 82, Julian Jeweil, Arjun Vagale, Kohra, and Vinayaka, Belkond was destined to be in the business of music. And so, at the age of 17 he took to deejaying and producing. He was a resident DJ at Marbela Beach Resort between 2014 and 2017, after which, he decided to be on his own and joined ReFresh Morjim as its DJ/programmer. Today, he plays for most of the parties in North Goa, while also being an important figure for the underground music scene of India. <br/><br/><b>Dramatiq </b><br/>A musician, DJ, and deep house enthusiast, Bhavesh Parihar aka Dramatiq is a man of multiple talents.
