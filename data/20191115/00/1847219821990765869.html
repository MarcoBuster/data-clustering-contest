      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/15/swedens-central-bank-dumps-australian-bonds-over-high-emissions">British news portal The Guardian reports</a> Riksbank deputy governor, Martin Floden, said earlier this wek the bank would no longer invest in assets from issuers with a large climate footprint, even if the yields were high.</p>
      <h3>«Australia and Canada are countries that are not known for good climate work. Greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world,»</h3>
      <p>he said in a speech at Orebro University in Sweden.</p>
      <p>Alberta’s government on Wednesday insisted that the province «has the highest environmental standards in the world,» and said the energy industry is continually improving its environmental footprint.</p>
      <p>Floden, who did not give details, stated Sweden had invested around 8% of its foreign exchange reserves in various kinds of Australian and Canadian bonds, The Guardian reports.</p>
