      <h1>15 disqualified MLAs join BJP; Baig left in the lurch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bangalore Mirror Bureau</a></address>
      <p>Battlelines are drawn for the December 5 byelections after the BJP announced tickets to all but two disqualified MLAs. <br/><br/>While former minister R Shankar, who joined the party along with 15 disqualified MLAs, has been denied a ticket, R Roshan Baig, also an ex-minister, was ignored by the party brass due to his alleged role in the IMA scam. <br/><br/>Minister KS Eshwrappa’s son KE Kanthesh is likely to be given a ticket from Ranebennur instead of Shankar. <br/><br/>Former minister MTB Nagaraj, who is facing the heat of a rebellion by Sharath Gowda, son of BJP Lok Sabha member BN Bachche Gowda, skipped joining the party as he filed a fresh set of papers from Hoskote. <br/><br/>Sharath too filed his papers after taking out a rally with thousands of his supporters. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and JD(S) State president HK Kumaraswamy who released a list of candidates said that they will back Sharath.</p>
      <p>I had trusted some of these disqualified MLAs. But they backstabbed me. The people who are singing paeans will backstab Yediyurappa in the coming days ­</p>
      <p>–Siddaramaiah<br/><br/>On a day of series of developments, the disqualified MLAs joined the BJP along with their supporters at the party’s head office in Malleshwaram, in the presence of state president Nalinkumar Kateel, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and BJP in-charge Muralidhar Rao. <br/><br/>Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who is upset at not being given a ticket from Athani, was conspicuous by his absence at the event. <br/><br/>Welcoming the disqualified MLAs, Yediyurappa said that he is committed to protecting their interests. He even sent out a warning his party cadre and asked them to work for the victory of all the disqualified MLAs as they too are part of the BJP. <br/><br/><b>Rebel trouble</b> <br/><br/>The BJP is already feeling the heat of rebellion as some of their MLA candidates who were defeated are keen to contest the polls. In Hoskote, Sharath has turned against the party and filed his nomination papers on Thursday. <br/><br/>In Shivajinagar, BJP defeated candidate and former minister Katta Subramanya Naidu is seeking a ticket for his son, Katta Jagadish Naidu. <br/><br/>Though the party has not admitted Baig into it’s fold, it has not yet announced a candidate for Shivajinagar. There are reports that the BJP may support Baig, who is planning to contest as an independent candidate. <br/><br/>In Rajarajeshwari Nagar, where the elections are not being held due to a pending poll petition, BJP defeated candidate Muniraju Gowda is keen to contest. There is also pressure on him to withdraw the fake voter identity case against disqualified MLA Munirathna. <br/><br/><b>JD(S) targets Siddu<br/></b><br/>Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy after releasing the first list of JD(S) candidates lashed out at Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah. <br/>“He is the reason for the BJP coming to power,” he said. He accused Siddaramaiah of spreading stories of theJD(S) being the B team of the BJP. <br/>Commenting on his father former prime minister HD Deve Gowda’s remark that Yediyurappa will remain chief minister for the remaining term, Kumaraswamy said that it does not mean that they have an understanding with the BJP. <br/><br/><b>Stigma attached: Siddaramaiah<br/></b><br/><br/>On disqualified MLAs joining the BJP, Siddaramaiah said that both the BJP and the disqualified MLAs stand exposed. <br/><br/>“I had trusted some of these disqualified MLAs. But they backstabbed. The people who are singing paeans will backstab Yediyurappa in the coming days,’’ he added. <br/><br/><br/>On the JD(S) supporting Bacheche Gowda’s son Sharath Gowda in Hosakote, the former Chief Minister expressed skepticism and said, “Both Deve Gowda and Bacheche Gowda are like snake and mangoose. I don’t know what is the deal behind JD(S) backing an independent candidate.’’</p>
