      <p>SCHOOL pupils have been learning about different religions as part of a week-long campaign to promote understanding.</p>
      <p>Youngsters at the Deanery, a Church of England school, were given an insight into Sikh teachings and the Hindu festival of Diwali during the nationwide Inter Faith Week.</p>
      <p>Dawinderpal Singh, an educator for Everything 13, was invited to speak to the children about Sikhism.</p>
      <p>He said: “It happens to be the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak who is the founder of Sikhism and it just seems to be a happy coincidence that it’s the same day as I’ve been invited here.</p>
      <p>“I taught them about the concept of selfless service and not expecting anything in return. I love doing interfaith work. All the children have been brilliant, they’ve been very open minded and have had a lot of questions. Seeing them get involved and sitting on the floor to eat was a really nice surprise.”</p>
      <p>Year 7 pupil Imogen, 11, found the exercise valuable. She said: “The speaker explained to us what Sikhism is all about and why it’s important to him.</p>
      <p>“For them to also help the homeless as part of their beliefs is very selfless, they’re giving up their time to give people food. I’ve enjoyed learning about other religions, it’s all very interesting.”</p>
      <p>Classmate Madison, 11, said: “Even though you may not believe in what others do you have to respect that and be kind to people. It’s not just Christians who believe in God, Sikhs believe in God too so in some ways they are quite similar.<br/><a href="https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/18034925.pupils-learn-sikhism-inter-faith-week/?fbclid=IwAR0Bibv4dr7bXKvUabm6cdHy-lGiDorUeD-T_IL78XxEJzfBGegUSCvHb5w">...Click here to read the whole article</a></p>
