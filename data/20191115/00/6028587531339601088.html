      <p>Night Bass record label has been releasing bass heavy house tracks for the past five years. Today marks the imprint’s 100th release, and label boss <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakocay/2019/01/28/12-holy-ship-artists-share-their-favorite-memories-from-the-music-festival-cruise/#351b28ef3aad">AC Slater</a> has brought together legendary purveyors of Night Bass music to celebrate the commemorative release with the <i>One Hundred</i> EP. The <i>One Hundred</i> EP boasts nine tracks from label artists including Chris Lorenzo, Flava D, Taiki Nulight and, of course, AC Slater, and the release represents the core sound that Night Bass is known for. AC Slater says the artists on the EP have been releasing on the label since its beginning. “It's an awesome way to honor the work they've put in for Night Bass, and also give the fans more of the music they love,” he says. </p>
      <p>To accompany the EP, AC Slater says the Night Bass team is releasing the EP on vinyl and they are also working on exclusive merchandise that won’t be like other merchandise they have released before. The producer adds that he originally started Night Bass five years ago as a place to showcase the artists and music that he was interested in. He adds that he felt there wasn’t a place at the time for the niche house sound that Night Bass has since become known for. “Over the years it has also evolved into an outlet for me to introduce new and up-and-coming producers to our audience,” he says. </p>

      <p>The label has expanded since its inception as it hosted its inaugural festival, Night Bass City, in Chicago earlier this year. The festival sold out with 4,000 attendees and featured exclusive merchandise, carnival-style games, a stage for rare back-to-back sets and views of the Windy City skyline. “It seemed like the next natural step for us,” the label head says. “We've been throwing events for five years, and our fanbase has gotten bigger and bigger. We wanted to put our vibe into a bigger space and bring Night Baes from all over the country and the world to meet each other and celebrate the music together.”</p>
      <p>Between the <i>One Hundred</i> EP and Night Bass City, AC Slater has had a busy past few months. He also released an album dubbed <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/34FdHQePHZ12S0ieFogpgO?si=5mnIa43fQb-1glS2kP9SCw"><i>Hi8</i></a> on September 27. The producer says his inspiration for the album came from him watching old Hi8 tapes that he has had since he was 15-years-old. “It made me think about personal evolution and how important it is to look back at what led you to where you are now,” he adds. “For the album, I dug deep into my musical inspirations and looked back at the artists that paved the way for us. I thought about how we have to take what they created and put our spin on it to pass down to the next wave of artists after us. So <i>Hi8</i> was a combination of honoring the music that inspired me the most [and] the music that I want to keep making on Night Bass and for the fans.” </p>
      <p>Going forward, AC Slater says he plans to celebrate Night Bass’ 6-year anniversary in a special way. But until then, he says he already has music slotted for 2020 and he hopes to host more large events like Night Bass City.  </p>
