        <b>Germany has had since 1991 a solidarity tax requiring people in western Germany to support the east of the country to support its economic development. The government has decided to largely lift it from 2021.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eastern-german-solidarity-tax-to-be-abolished-for-almost-all-taxpayers/a-51235971">German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports</a> that the federal government agreed on Thursday, November 14, to almost-entirely abolish the so-called solidarity tax.</p>
      <p>Introduced in 1991 after German reunification, the tax on people in former West Germany raised money to invest in projects and infrastructure in the former communist East, where living standards and average income were lower.</p>
      <h3>The tax will be abolished for 90% of taxpayers from 2021.</h3>
      <p>6.5% per cent of taxpayers will pay a reduced rate while 3.5% of the wealthiest Germans will continue to pay it at its full rate.</p>
      <p>German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz commented that the abolition was possible because of how far Germany had come in the years since reunification, DW reports.</p>
