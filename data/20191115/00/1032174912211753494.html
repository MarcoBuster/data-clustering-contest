      <p>Enormously popular Caxton Street bar Lefty’s Old Time Music Hall has closed. The venue served its final drinks late last week before for-lease signs were affixed to the front of the venue on Saturday morning, <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/business/popular-caxton-st-venue-closes-amid-allegations-of-tens-of-thousands-owed/news-story/66fe264bc725e08101b686f74a6faa35">the <i>Courier-Mail</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The paper writes that the closure took place against a backdrop of significant debts allegedly owed by Lefty’s licensee Arklow Pty Ltd to various entities. Remax real estate agent Geoff Esdale told the <i>Courier</i> that the building is now available for lease, but also for sale for $3.5 million. “I’ve had a deluge of calls since the sign went up Saturday morning,” he told the paper.</p>
      <p>It’s a disappointing end for Lefty’s, which under the stewardship of original owner Jamie Webb developed a reputation as one of Brisbane’s very best nightspots, much loved for its freewheeling atmosphere and first-class live music performances (Webb sold Lefty’s in October last year).</p>
      <p>Lefty’s also became a frontline in the debate over ID-scanning laws, with Webb a vocal critic of the scanning machines. “It’s terrible. It’s terrible. And it’s taken 20 per cent off our revenue,” <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/brisbane/food-and-drink/article/new-report-queensland-id-scanners-are-catching-barely-any-banned-drinkers">he told <i>Broadsheet</i> in October 2018</a>. “It’s killed Caxton Street, it’s killed our late-night economy. Two years ago, it was thriving on Friday and Saturday nights. Now The Caxton, [strip club] Honey B’s and us are the only places open, so it’s a bit lonely.”</p>
      <p>The closure of Lefty's leaves a sizeable hole in Caxton Street's nightlife. The relatively small safe night precinct has struggled to absorb the impact of ID-scanning laws since their introduction in mid-2017.</p>
