      <h1>This Week In XR: Apple AR Glasses Target 2022, Magic Leap Making News, Specs 3.0, Reanimating Dead Celebrities</h1>

      <p>An internal Apple document revealed the company plans to launch an XR headworn display (HMD) in 2020. Apple plans to evolve the smartglasses from a media consumption device into something more mobile with pass-through (seeing the world through your camera) technology, enhanced by speedy 5G, and contextually aware AI. This is a very big deal for many reasons, including (1) the use of pass through vs. the see-through approach of Magic Leap and the Microsoft HoloLens and (2) competitors with designs on the consumer market like Facebook, Snap and Magic Leap now have three years to establish their products. This is going to be fun.</p>

      <p>Speaking of Magic Leap. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/magic-leap-series-e-funding-1203401035/"><b>News of their upcoming Series E financing broke as Variety revealed JP Morgan Chase had taken control of its patents as collateral for a massive line of credit. </b></a>The company asserted this was normal in an announcement. Rumors have been building over the past several months as the company’s diverse and ambitious plans for an AI centric “Magicverse” have led to questions about its core spatial computing glasses. The company has not yet followed up the releases of its $2,000 developer XR glasses, The Magic Leap One, with a consumer device. They are slowly adding content, but it’s nothing like the torrid pace of new software hitting the Oculus Quest, which now has over fifty titles. And there was no follow up to Magic Leap’s first annual developer conference in LA last fall. We continue to follow its releases of apps like spatial Spotify (more about this below), while we wait for AAA titles promised in the fall of 2018.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.spectacles.com/"><b>New Snap Spectacles</b></a><b> arrive, now with 2 cameras.</b> The new version of Snap’s sunglasses-with-a-camera now has an additional camera for creating depth in the images it takes. The depth information also allows for more augmented reality effects to be overlayed atop the videos recorded using the Spectacles 3.</p>
      <p>Tom Emrich, VP of 8th Wall (producers of a popular webXR development platform), made the Specs video above. Here’s how he did it with his new Specs 3:</p>
      <p>-You wear the Spectacles</p>
      <p>-Tap on the button on the top of the glasses </p>
      <p>-It records a 10 second video using the 2 HD cameras </p>
      <p>-There are no Effects live as there is no display to view this on the glasses </p>
      <p>-You open Snapchat app</p>
      <p>-You see new snaps can be imported</p>
      <p>-You connect the glasses to your smartphone via a WiFi network</p>
      <p>-You import the snap </p>
      <p>-You tap edit and it generates the 3D version using the depth map from the two cameras</p>
      <p>-You can then swipe to choose a 3D effect </p>
      <p>The Spectacles can be ordered for $380 on the <a href="https://www.spectacles.com/">product’s website</a>. This is big deal because, for the first time, Snap Specs are more than a camera on sunglasses, they can actually combine, even realistically anchor, digital content on the real world.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.bynorth.com/focals"><b>Our normally level headed friends at North</b></a> emailed us with an with announcement it has added 36 apps since its introduction of its Focals smartglasses last fall, using the odd image above to promote it. During a beautiful sunset moment like this do we really want to be interrupted by a text, or the weather? This why AR Wearables need to be contextually aware.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.magicleap.com/news/partner-stories/put-music-in-your-world-with-spotify-on-magic-leap-one"><b>Spotify releases AR app on Magic Leap. </b></a>The new music app for Magic Leap shows a spatially aware interface for your music, i.e. an album cover positioned on your wall like a picture. The app is also capable of switching songs when you move from room to room. You can download the app on your Magic Leap One headset today, and you’ll need Spotify Premium to run it. </p>
      <p><b>Flow’s 3D data visualization tools come to Magic Leap.</b> Here’s why we love Flow: you can instantly upload any spreadsheet into its online platform, and like magic a spatial depiction of the data comes out. You can view it on a PC, Tablet and now, the Magic Leap One. The Flow Editor is available <a href="https://a.flow.gl/#/">here</a></p>

The research is separate from Facebook, but he will still aide the company on the development side of Oculus. </p>
      <p><b>Location based VR company </b><a href="https://arenaspace.io/"><b>ARena Space</b></a><b> analyzed 9 months of visitor data. </b>The company’s 11 locations in Eastern Europe received more than 150,000 visitors from December 2018 - August 2019. The analysis found that the majority of park visitors are millennial men and the most popular day is Sunday. As well as larger parks coincide with longer time spent at the venue and more return visits. And 93% of visitors are first time VR users. </p>
