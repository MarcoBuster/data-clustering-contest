      <p>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - Gov. Mike Dunleavy says the odds of a special legislative session yet this year to address the check paid to residents from the state’s oil-wealth fund appear increasingly less likely.</p>
      <p>In August, Dunleavy accepted the dividend passed by lawmakers, which amounted to $1,606, but said he viewed it as partial payment and anticipated a fall special session to address the issue.</p>
      <p>Under state law, for a non-emergency special session during the interim, at least 30 days’ notice is required. That would push any special session now up against the holidays.</p>
