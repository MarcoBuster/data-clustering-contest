        <b>In the international friendly between Brazil and Argentina in Saudi Arabia, it was the latter who came away smiling after Leo Messi's early goal secured his team the win.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In <b>a fiery game</b> that saw these two <b>South American giants</b> battle it out, <a href="https://es.besoccer.com/jugador/l-messi-23569">Lionel's Messi</a>'s penalty secured the victory against their rivals in Qatar. This means he has <b>extended his country's unbeaten run to six games.</b></p>
      <p>There was<b> plenty of drama inside the first quarter of an hour.</b> The first real action was a penalty, after <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/gabriel-jesus-266974/">Gabriel Jesus</a> was bundled over by Pezzella in the box. Jesus stepped up to take the penalty and tried to trick the keeper with a slow penalty to the right, although the keeper dived the wrong way,<b> Jesus could not hit the target and his shot went wide</b>. A terrible penalty which could have put Brazil in the lead and changed the game entirely.</p>
      <p>Less than five minutes later there was <b>another penalty</b>, this time at the other end, as Leo Messi went down in the box due to <b>a foul from Alex Sandro,</b> who clumsily caught him from behind. <b>Messi took the penalty and Alisson managed to save it</b>, but Messi was too quick and <b>slotted the rebound into the back of the net</b> before anybody could stop him. It was 0-1 in the 11th minute!</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/seleccion-brasil/">Brazil</a> tried and tried to hunt for the equaliser, but they<b> were sloppy on the ball </b>and did not really make any of their chances count and the<b> first half finished 0-1.</b></p>

      <p>Brazil <b>showed their quality a little more in the second half</b>, but also summed up their inability to finish, as they had a lot of the ball, but <b>could not take advantage of this</b>, which cost them greatly in the end.</p>
      <p>Towards the end,<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/seleccion-argentina/"> Argentina</a> were sensing another goal after they <b>put a lot of pressure on in their attacking third</b>, but <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/alisson-becker-136376/">Alisson</a> did well and <b>made a lot of good saves</b> to ensure that Brazil did not fall behind even deeper. </p>
      <p>After a game that saw a lot of yellow cards and <b>a lack of quality from Brazil</b>. Argentina came away with the win, which they will be very pleased about.<b> This was a game of very few shots and very few chances</b> of real quality. Brazil did not perform up to standard and although the had a lot of the ball, they could not do anything with it. Very poor from Brazil and<b> very good on and off the ball for Argentina.</b> Final score Brazil 0-1 Argentina! </p>
      <p>Argentina's unbeaten run extends to six games and they <b>will be hoping to end their year on a high with another win against Uruguay</b> on Monday. Brazil's winless run continues as <b>Tite's side are now without a win in five </b>games. He will be hoping to turn things around in their next game though when they face <b>South Korea.</b></p>
