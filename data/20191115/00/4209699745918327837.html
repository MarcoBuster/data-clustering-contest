      <p>Governors of the All Progressives Congress says the failure of Adams Oshiomhole to hold a NEC meeting was unfair to President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>The governors under the aegis of the Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF) noted with displeasure that the last NEC meeting was held in August 2018.</p>
      <p>Salihu Lukman, the director general of the forum while speaking to journalists in Abuja on Thursday, said a National Executive Council meeting of the party had become necessary to address some of the crisis in the party.</p>
      <p>According to him, President Muhammadu Buhari had appealed to the party’s leadership to institutionalize the party’s by following the rules of the party.</p>
      <p>He said it was also a breach of the party’s constitution that the NEC had not been held in over one year when the party’s constitution provides that such a meeting should be held every quarter.</p>
      <p>The director general pointed out that Oshiomhole had on May 10, 2018, made a declaration speech that he would ensure that all organs of the party regularly meet to promote internal democracy as stipulated by the party’s constitution.</p>
      <p>“For instance, article 25 of the APC constitution provides that national convention shall be held once in two years, NEC meeting holds every quarter and National Working Committee (NWC) meeting once every month,” Lukman said.</p>
