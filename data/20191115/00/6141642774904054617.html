      <p>Home favourite Mark Allen is out of the Northern Ireland Open after Alexander Ursenbacher edged a 4-3 victory in Belfast.</p>
      <p>Having whitewashed Scott Donaldson 4-0 earlier on Thursday, world number seven Allen was in fine form as he looked to reach the quarter-finals at the Waterfront Hall.</p>
      <p>However, Ursenbacher raced into a 2-0 lead with breaks of 62 and 64. Allen responded emphatically with a knock of 101 before levelling the match.</p>
      <p>Ursenbacher (72) and Allen (103) shared another frame apiece before the 23-year-old Swiss held his nerve to take the deciding frame with a break of 69.</p>

      <p>However, Murphy hit back, taking a tight second frame before moving to within a frame of victory with a break of 62. Hawkins won the next frame with a 129 to give himself a fighting chance, but Murphy clinched the win in the sixth.</p>
      <p>He will face five-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan in the last eight after his convincing 4-1 win over Yuan Sijun.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan edged a close opening frame and then doubled his lead with an emphatic break of 127. Yuan pulled a frame back and threatened to level the match, only for the Rocket to storm to victory with breaks of 78 and 57.</p>

      <p>Trump took another step towards defending the Alex Higgins trophy and has not dropped a frame since the third frame of his second-round clash win over Zhang Ada.</p>
      <p>He will play Anthony Hamilton in the quarter-finals after he overcame Kyren Wilson 4-3 in a deciding frame.</p>
      <p>Joe Perry is also in the last eight after the Englishman raced to a 4-1 victory over Robbie Williams, producing runs of 76, 77 and breaks of 62 and 70 in the same frame.</p>
      <p>Mark Selby was also a 4-1 winner against Ken Doherty while John Higgins overcame fellow Scot Stephen Maguire 4-3 late on Thursday night to complete the quarter-final line up.</p>
