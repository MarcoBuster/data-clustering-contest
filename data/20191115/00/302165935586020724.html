      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 15 — e-Cigarettes have become hugely popular in the past decade but a rash of vaping-linked deaths and illnesses is feeding caution about a product, already banned in some places.</p>
      <p>Yesterday an 18-year-old man died in Belgium in a vaping-linked death, the first such case in the country.</p>
      <p>Here are five things to know about electronic cigarettes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Around for two decades</b>
      </p>
      <p>Early designs for an electronic cigarette were drawn up in the United States in the 1960s but Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik is acknowledged as the inventor of a viable commercial version in the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>Hon, who was trying to quit his own pack-a-day habit, took out patents between 2003 and 2005. But his devices would soon be overtaken as the international market exploded.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do they work?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A battery powers a coil that heats a liquid containing various amounts of nicotine as well as propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, which mimic tobacco smoke when heated.</p>
      <p>This “e-juice” can also contain flavourings and other substances, such as THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.</p>
      <p>e-Cigarettes are mostly draw-activated, with the puffing releasing vapour.</p>
      <p>They do not produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of tobacco's most noxious elements and associated with cancer and cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Harmful to health?</b>
      </p>
      <p>e-Cigarettes were initially touted as less damaging than tobacco, which causes around eight million deaths a year.</p>
      <p>In 2015 public health authorities in England said best estimates showed they were 95 percent less harmful than tobacco.</p>
      <p>However concern has been growing and in July 2019 the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that electronic smoking devices were “undoubtedly harmful and should therefore be subject to regulation.”</p>
      <p>Another worry is that the vaping flavours are particularly attractive to teenagers and an enticement to pick up the habit.</p>
      <p>In 2019 the vaping industry is facing major scrutiny amid an epidemic of lung conditions linked to e-cigarette use that has killed 39 and sickened more than 2,000 mostly young people in the US.</p>
      <p>In November 2019 US health officials said they had identified vitamin E acetate, an oil sometimes used as a thickening agent for vaping products, as the likely culprit behind the epidemic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Exponential growth</b>
      </p>
      <p>The number of vapers worldwide has leapt from seven million in 2011 to 41 million in 2018, according to leading market researcher Euromonitor International.</p>
      <p>By comparison, there were 1.1 billion tobacco smokers on the planet in 2016, according to latest WHO figures on its website.</p>
      <p>The largest markets for e-cigarettes are the United States followed by Britain, France, Germany and China.</p>
      <p>The increase in vaping has been particularly dramatic among teenagers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Moving towards regulation</b>
      </p>
      <p>In September 2019 India became the latest country to ban the import, sale, production and advertising of e-cigarettes, citing in particular concerns about its youth.</p>
      <p>The devices are already banned in several places, such as Brazil, Singapore, Thailand and the US state of Massachusetts, but elsewhere legislations is inconsistent.</p>
      <p>In June 2019 San Francisco became the first major US city to effectively ban the sale and manufacture of electronic cigarettes.</p>
      <p>In September New York followed Michigan in banning flavoured e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>On November 11, US President Donald Trump said he planned to meet with vaping industry representatives as he considers whether to ban flavoured e-cigarette products.</p>
      <p>Trump has said he supports raising the minimum age for the purchase of e-cigarettes from 18 to 21, but he has also indicated he is concerned about over-regulation of business. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
