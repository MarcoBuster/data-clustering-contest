      <p>The annual charity fundraising event Desert Bus for Hope has, as of the close of its latest marathon, raised over $6 million for charity in the 12 years since its very first run.</p>
      <p>All in all, <a href="https://desertbus.org/?id=21838">2019’s days-long saga raised $864,415</a> for the charity Child’s Play. The core of the annual event is a live-streamed session Desert Bus minigame from the unreleased 1995 Sega CD game <i>Penn &amp; Teller’s Smoke and Mirrors</i>.</p>
      <p>That segment simulates a real-time bus trip between Tuscon, Arizona and Las Vegas, Nevada, requiring players to take control of the bus for eight actual, real world hours to complete the journey.</p>
      <p>The Desert Bus for Hope adopted the strange mini-game into a live-streamed charity event where the journey lasts as long as donations over a gradually increasing threshold continue to roll in, all the while hosting guests and charity events as the bus rolls along.</p>
      <p>This year’s event saw the trip lasting 162 total hours, and tipping the event’s lifetime earnings over that $6 million mark. Last year’s event, for comparison, raised $730,099 and kept the bus moving for 160 to surpass $5 million lifetime raised.</p>
