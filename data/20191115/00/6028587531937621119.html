      <p>Kiss has <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kiss-final-concert-end-of-the-road-tour-dates-907495/">announced</a> that it is the end of the road for the band’s <i>End of the Road</i> tour, but it remains a long and winding one with approximately 90 more shows on the schedule. Said Paul Stanley from the stage on the Kiss Kruise in a <a href="https://youtu.be/H7s3T7Ybkqw">video</a> posted one week ago on the band’s YouTube channel, “So we’re here to tell you that the <i>End of The Road</i> comes to an end on July 17, 2021 in New York City. Now we’ve already done 90 shows like to over 2 million people. We’re about to put up 90 more shows. We’ve got a lot of great stuff planned…everything you all deserve.”<i>Watch the video announcement below.</i></p>
      <p>The Kiss homepage now highlights the milestone with a flaming countdown calendar/clock. According to the band’s website, Kiss will end 2019 in Nagoya, Japan and begin 2020 touring in Manchester, New Hampshire. To date, New York City is the only destination currently revealed on the 2021 schedule. But there is an entire year to tackle before that.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kiss-final-concert-end-of-the-road-tour-dates-907495/">Rolling Stone</a>, tickets for the 2020 second North American leg will go on sale November 22nd with earlier pre-sale dates for meet and greets, Kiss Army fan club members and Citi cardholders.</p>
      <p>Today’s Kiss video <a href="https://twitter.com/kiss/status/1194993626813591552?s=20">tweet</a> promises that “history will be made” which is pretty much signature Kiss—constantly upping their game when it comes to performing and perfecting over-the-top audience engagement tactics.</p>
      <p>“We’ve always been about giving the fans more,” explained Simmons in a 2016 <a href="https://drnancyberk.com/gene-simmons-talks-kiss-and-showbiz-episode-336/">podcast interview</a> with me. “More is a good word because when somebody plunks down a dollar, for what it is you do, they deserve bang for the buck. And that’s what we do. What we do since we first started 42 years ago [now 46] is a self-imposed mandate to stand guilty as charged by our harshest critics of making a complete spectacle out of ourselves. You’re damn right we do." </p>
      <p>Will this really mark the end of all Kiss touring? In an entertainment world where many farewell tours mean “see you later,” I wouldn’t bet on it. After all, there was that 2000 Kiss Farewell tour. That being said, no one can deny that the band has certainly more than earned the right to rest or retire from the road.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyOw2FDjfQOFQH7paKxNVvA">band’s YouTube channel</a> describes the <i>End Of The Road World</i> tour as “Our final tour ever.” That sure sounds like tour retirement unless you look at past history as a predictor. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Grammy-nominated band members with over four decades of success, 44 albums (with over 100 million albums sold) and two Top 10 hits and 24 songs on the <i>Billboard</i> charts, have always seemed game to add accomplishments to their arsenal.</p>
      <p>Validated by the Recording Industry Association as America’s #1 Gold Record Award-winning group of all time in all group categories, Kiss also rocks licensing and merchandising, besting the sales of Beatles and Elvis merchandise. Band members may be the rock stars selling out stadiums and cruise ships, but Simmons says the fans are the real bosses.</p>
      <p>It is hard to think about Simmons or Stanley trading in stage time for a little R &amp; R, but both have acknowledged the intensity and extremes of Kiss touring. From weighty costumes (Simmons estimated his dragon boots, armor and guitar weigh in at around 50 pounds) and extreme temperatures to makeup routines (hours of application before the show can even begin), the schedule and expectations would be grueling for a teen, let alone adults over the age of sixty (Simmons is 70 years old, Stanley, 67.). </p>
      <p>Why does Kiss devote so much attention to touring? Said Stanley in a separate 2016 <a href="https://drnancyberk.com/paul-stanley-talks-kiss-and-showbiz-episode-337/">podcast interview</a>, “We want to spend time with the people who made us who we are.” As the countdown begins and the <i>End of The Road</i> tour nears its end, Kiss will be doing a lot of that. But if their fan base is really the boss that drives the machine, what happens when that boss demands another tour? Stay tuned.</p>
