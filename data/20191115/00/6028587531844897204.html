      <p><b>Topline: </b>As Amazon gears up to legally challenge the Pentagon’s decision to award Microsoft with the $10 billion JEDI contract—alleging <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50428744">political pressure</a> from the president—it recalls the history of discord between CEO Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The feud between Trump and the world’s richest man (Bezos is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/#3b3bb35f1b23">worth</a> $109.1 billion, according to <i>Forbes</i> estimates) started in December 2015, when the then-Republican candidate criticized Bezos, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/673881733415178240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E673881733415178240&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Fworld%2Ftrump-vs-bezos-a-history-of-their-twitter-clashes-14859977">alleging</a> that he owns the <i>Washington Post </i>in order to keep taxes down at his “no profit company,” Amazon. </li>
        <li>That prompted a sarcastic response from Bezos, who offered to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2015/12/07/bezos-responds-to-trump-tweets-by-offering-to-send-him-to-space/#6c7e94f639d5">send Trump to space</a> on one of his Blue Origin rockets. </li>
        <li>Following a lull, Trump again ramped up his criticism of Amazon in mid-2017, and for several years now the president has frequently slammed Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, who owns the <i>Washington Post</i>, another consistent target of Trump’s. </li>
        <li>The president is <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-regulation-amazon-facebook-646c642c-a2d7-454b-a9a9-cdc6e4eaef2c.html">reportedly “obsessed”</a> with taking down Amazon: He has criticized the company for <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/979326715272065024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E979326715272065024&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Fworld%2Ftrump-vs-bezos-a-history-of-their-twitter-clashes-14859977">not paying enough</a> in taxes and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/981168344924536832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E981168344924536832&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Fworld%2Ftrump-vs-bezos-a-history-of-their-twitter-clashes-14859977">taking advantage</a> of the U.S. Postal Service, claiming Amazon uses the USPS as its own “<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/981168344924536832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E981168344924536832&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Fworld%2Ftrump-vs-bezos-a-history-of-their-twitter-clashes-14859977">delivery boy</a>” which <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/980063581592047617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E980063581592047617&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Fworld%2Ftrump-vs-bezos-a-history-of-their-twitter-clashes-14859977">costs taxpayers</a> billions of dollars.</li>
        <li>Trump has also repeatedly complained about the <i>Washington Post</i> because of its negative coverage of him, calling the publication a “<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1015586529484443648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1015586529484443648&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Fworld%2Ftrump-vs-bezos-a-history-of-their-twitter-clashes-14859977">propaganda machine</a>,”</li>
        <li>Among other tweets, Trump has lashed out at Bezos personally, in January calling him “Jeff <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1084627451983073280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1084627451983073280&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Fworld%2Ftrump-vs-bezos-a-history-of-their-twitter-clashes-14859977">Bozo</a>” and tweeting about the National Enquirer story detailing Bezos’ relationship with Laura Sanchez.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote: </b>Bezos <a href="https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f">responded</a> to that controversy in February, claiming that the National Enquirer’s parent company, AMI, and its leader, close Trump ally David Pecker, attempted to blackmail him. In the post, Bezos also addressed Trump’s repeated criticism. “It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience <i>Washington Post</i> news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,” Bezos <a href="https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f">wrote</a>. “President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets.”</p>
      <p><b>News Peg: </b>Amazon confirmed on Thursday that it had filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, indicating that it will <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-protest-pentagon-contract-award-to-microsoft-11573769321">protest</a> the Pentagon’s decision to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/10/25/microsoft-beats-amazon-for-10b-pentagon-jedi-contract/#1a20a4f42e95">award Microsoft</a> a massive cloud-computing contract in October. Amazon had long been considered the favorite to win the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract, which is worth $10 billion over a decade, but that changed after President Trump <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-vows-close-look-at-computing-contract-amazon-seeks-11563478486?mod=article_inline&amp;mod=article_inline">began to question</a> the evaluation process  and ramped up his criticism of Amazon. In a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-protest-pentagon-contract-award-to-microsoft-11573769321">recent statement</a>, a spokesperson from Amazon Web Services (AWS, the company’s cloud business) cited “clear deficiencies,” “unmistakable bias” and “political influence” within the Pentagon’s decision.</p>
