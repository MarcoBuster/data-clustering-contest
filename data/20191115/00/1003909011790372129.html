      <h1>Provincial education cuts lead to $308 transportation fee for Rocky View Schools: trustees</h1>

      <p>The UCP government’s budget axe means parents of Rocky View Schools students will be shouldering a $308 busing fee, say the district’s trustees.</p>
      <p>Those trustees say the province’s elimination of $1.4 million in transportation funding is forcing it to implement the fee for students living 2.4 kilometres or farther from their designated school.</p>
      <p>“Families impacted by the additional student transportation fee will receive further information on this by the end of the month,” states a letter from trustees sent to parents Thursday.</p>
      <p>Overall, the district said the provincial budget handed down last month means a $10-million funding shortfall for this school year which will be covered partly by drawing on $5.325 million in reserves and the rest by spending reductions.</p>
      <p>The changes will translate into a $40-per-student spending reduction, which will make up $1 million of that funding gap for the school system that borders Calgary on its north, east and west sides, said the letter.</p>
      <p>Trustees, who oversee a system encompassing more than 25,000 students, couldn’t be reached for comment Thursday.</p>
      <p>One person who said they were a Rocky View Schools parent voiced frustration on Twitter with what they said was a steep additional cost.</p>
      <p>“My kids’ bus fees are going to be $308 a kid for a total of $616 for me,” tweeted Erin. “Merry Christmas. Are we winning yet, Alberta?”</p>
      <p>The school district’s plight reflects the reckless spending cuts the UCP government still hasn’t admitted to, said NDP education critic Sarah Hoffman.</p>
      <p>The province says its per-student funding has been maintained but critics insist cuts to other spending areas have taken a toll, one of them transportation subsidies.</p>
      <p>“We have watched the Premier and the Minister of Education repeatedly stand in the Legislature and claim they have followed through on a campaign promise to maintain education funding,” Hoffman said in a statement.</p>

      <p>“The UCP’s budget will force Albertans to pay more for less while big corporations cash in on a $4.7-billion no-jobs corporate handout. Our students are suffering and teachers are being laid off.”</p>
      <p>A statement released by Alberta Education cited UCP MLAs for Airdrie-East and Airdrie-Cochrane, Angela Pitts and Peter Guthrie respectively, who have told local newspapers the impact of reductions in education budgeting have been exaggerated and can be handled by efficiencies and use of reserves.</p>
      <p>“Despite the NDP’s false claims, education funding has been maintained at $8.223 billion, equal to 2018-19 actuals,” stated spokesman Colin Aitchison.</p>
      <p>“MLAs Pitt and Guthrie both accurately indicated that Rocky View Schools should have little difficulty adjusting their budget, and we encourage the school division to prioritize their students and find efficiencies that do not impact the classroom.”</p>

      <p>Provincial officials have similarly told the Calgary Board of Education it should be able to find efficiencies to cover what the CBE says is a $32 million shortfall due to the UCP budget.</p>
      <p>But CBE trustees say they’ve already found many millions of dollars in efficiencies in recent years, adding that shortfall will grow to $48 million with teachers having to be paid out before the board’s fiscal blueprint in January.</p>
      <p>Up to 320 positions, including teachers, support staff and educational assistants could be laid off to balance the budget, with teachers shuffled into larger classrooms, CBE officials have said.</p>
      <p>Not yet revealed by the CBE is how they’ll deal with reductions to transportation grants that have significantly softened the blow to families whose children are bused to school.</p>
      <p>Nearly 1,200 Albertans through the advocacy group Support Our Students have sent a letter to their MLAs condemning the UCP budget’s impact on education.</p>
