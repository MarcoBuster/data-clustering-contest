      <p>With his slicked back blonde hair and wide, cheesy grin, Michael Sheen looks a dead ringer for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire host Chris Tarrant.</p>
      <p>The actor, 50, has swapped his trademark black curls and beard to transform into the TV presenter for new drama series Quiz.</p>
      <p>The ITV three-parter will re-tell the extraordinary story of how Charles and Diana Ingram attempted an “audacious heist” to con producers and channel chiefs out of the top prize money.</p>
      <p>In 2001 Major Ingram, his wife Diana and an accomplice, Tecwen Whittock -who was sitting in the audience - were accused of cheating their way to a million pounds by coughing.</p>

      <p>Sheen, 50, is best known for his film portrayals of former Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> .</p>
      <p>To capture Tarrant’s look he shaved off all facial hair before donning a “bald cap” and then a blonde wig.</p>
      <p>In the drama, directed by A Very English Scandal’s Stephen Frears, viewers will see him emulate the moment Tarrant arrived to give evidence at the Ingram trial at Southwark Crown Court in March 2003.</p>

      <p>Quiz was adapted by James Graham who had already developed the sensational story into a play which moved to the West End.</p>
      <p>“I was gripped by this story over 15 years ago, and I’m still gripped now,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very English heist. Putting it onto stage was such a lot of fun, and with a new team we now get to re-imagine the whole story afresh for television.”</p>

      <p>In the TV version, which hits screens next year, Matthew Macfadyen stars alongside Sheen as Major Charles Ingram, Sian Clifford is Diana Ingram, Mark Bonnar is Celador Television Chairman, Paul Smith and Helen McCrory plays Sonia Woodley QC.</p>
      <p>They are supported by Michael Jibson as Tecwen Whittock and Aisling Bea as ITV Entertainment Commissioner, Claudia Rosencrantz.</p>

      <p>The Ingrams were found guilty of “procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception” in 2003 and given two years suspended sentences, as well as being asked to pay a total of £115,000, including legal fees.</p>
      <p>The prosecution suggested that Diana and Whittock conspired to cough to indicate the correct answer on the show, aiding Charles Ingram on his path to £1m.</p>
