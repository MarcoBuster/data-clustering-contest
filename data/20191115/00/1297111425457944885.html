      <h1>Anti-poverty groups say province's new income support program inadequate</h1>
      <h2>"There's fundamental flaws with (SIS), and really the major fundamental flaw is its lack of adequacy."</h2>

      <p>Several anti-poverty groups in Regina are calling on the provincial government to redesign its recently introduced Saskatchewan Income Support (SIS) program, saying it is a downgrade from the previous program and is inadequate to meet the needs of people in poverty.</p>
      <p>SIS was implemented in July as a replacement for the former Saskatchewan Assistance Program (SAP), but on Thursday morning the anti-poverty groups gathered to say the new program has only brought more challenges.</p>
      <p>“There’s fundamental flaws with (SIS), and really the major fundamental flaw is its lack of adequacy,” said Peter Gilmer, an advocate with the Anti-Poverty Ministry.</p>
      <p>Through the SAP program, people received a shelter benefit and had their utilities covered under a separate benefit. Now utilities have been rolled into a single shelter benefit. Although the amount of the shelter benefit has increased some with this change, Gilmer said it did not increase enough to accommodate the cost of utilities, leaving residents further behind than before.</p>
      <p>In a written statement, the Ministry of Social Services said Saskatchewan is following suit with nearly every other jurisdiction in Canada by providing a lump sum amount for all shelter needs. It also said ministry staff “work alongside clients to make positive financial decisions, manage their benefits and budget for their household expenses including rent and utilities” through a new approach called Motivational Interviewing.</p>
      <p>Nairn MacKay, a member of End Poverty Regina, took issue with the Motivational Interviewing approach, saying it equated to trying to counsel someone out of poverty. While financial literacy may be a challenge for some, MacKay said many others are doing everything right but still can’t make ends meet.</p>
      <p>Gilmer agreed. “Even if you’re the best budgeter in the world … you’re still not in a position to meet your most basic needs, including food, shelter, clothing (and) utilities,” he said.</p>
      <p>Communication between people in need of income assistance and the Ministry of Social Services has also taken a turn for the worse with the new program, said Gilmer. People spending hours on the phone trying to reach a real person to talk to, calls not being returned and long wait times between applying for the SIS program and receiving any benefits have become all too common, he said.</p>
      <p>He noted that through SAP, each person had a specific case worker who they could contact if there was ever a concern or their needs changed, but that the SIS program is run more like a call centre.</p>
      <p>“The communication between people who are in need of income assistance and the system itself, that’s seen a major breakdown over the course of the last few months,” Gilmer said.</p>
      <p>“Many people over the course of the summer have no clue who their social worker is anymore.”</p>
      <p>In its written statement, the Ministry of Social Services said its staff work to “respond to client issues in a timely manner.”</p>
      <p>Carmichael Outreach and Poverty Free Saskatchewan were also present alongside Gilmer and MacKay on Thursday at the Anti-Poverty Ministry’s office based out of Knox Metropolitan United Church. They shared the same concerns over utility benefits and communication with the ministry.</p>
      <p>But overarching these issues was a greater concern shared by all the organizations that the Government of Saskatchewan has not taken the problem of income assistance inadequacy seriously.</p>
      <p>“1981 was the last time that income assistance benefits had any correlation to actual cost of living factors …” Gilmer said. “People get stuck on the same benefits decade after decade. This is a problem and at some point it has to be taken seriously.”</p>
      <p>In response to this concern, the ministry said in its statement that it has increased the amount of money clients can make before benefits are reduced.</p>
