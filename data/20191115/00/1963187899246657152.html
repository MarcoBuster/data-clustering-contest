      <p>CAIRO – 15 November 2019: Mostafa Mohamed established himself as the biggest star of Egypt U-23 team during the ongoing 2019 Africa U-23 Cup of Nations. <br/><br/>The striker showed character during Egypt’s three games at the group stage and led the team to secure a spot at the semi-finals after finishing on top of the group. <br/><br/>On Thursday night, Mohamed scored twice for the hosts to lead them to achieve their third straight victory at the coopetition and take his tournament’s goal tally to four which makes him the main contender for the tournament’s goal scoring award. <br/><br/>The striker’s performance against Cameroon earned him the Man-of-the-Match award for the second time as he earned the award after scoring the winning goal against Mali at the opening game. <br/><br/>“Individual titles mean nothing to me. My focus is the team and what’s important is to reach next year’s Tokyo Olympics.” The striker said after the game. <br/><br/>Mohamed was a very good surprise for the Egyptian fans who put much hopes on his shoulders to take the team to the Olympic Games in Tokyo next summer. <br/><br/>Egypt needs one victory from the two remaining games to secure one of the tickets to the Olympics. <br/><br/>Egypt, Group A leaders, will face the runner-up of Group B on Tuesday at Cairo International Stadium.</p>
