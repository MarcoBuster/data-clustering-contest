      <p>This month’s featured list, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/china-billionaires/#7ec3c02ae431">China Rich List</a>, has some lessons for all of us. Despite the turbulence of the U.S.-China trade war, wealth continues to be created in China at a remarkable pace. To be sure, China’s growth rate is slowing, but as Forbes Asia Chief Economics Commentator Yuwa Hendrick-Wong notes in his essay in this issue, that slowdown might have occurred in any event. As any economy matures, it cannot maintain the growth rates of its “emerging” phase. Plenty of opportunities remain for entrepreneurs in China to find new ways to build businesses and create wealth inside this ever-larger economy.</p>
      <p>The U.S. remains among the best places in the world to become a billionaire. Yet the playing field is being leveled. If one uses the last five years of data from Forbes’ ranking of global billionaires as a proxy for general wealth creation, the Asia-Pacific region is outstripping the U.S. From 2014 to 2019, the number of U.S. billionaires rose 13% to 607, and are collectively worth 19% more, at $3.1 trillion. In the Asia-Pacific, the number of billionaires rose 36% to 767, and their collective worth is up 47% to $2.5 trillion. Even more telling, the average worth of a U.S. billionaire is little changed in the last five years, up 4% to $5 billion. Meanwhile the figure for their Asia-Pacific counterparts is up 10% to $3.3 billion.</p>
      <p>While the average U.S. billionaire is still wealthier than their peer in this region, the gap is narrowing as the Asia-Pacific’s rate of wealth creation is more than double that of the U.S.—whether measured by number of billionaires, total net worth or average net worth. It almost goes without saying that China, as the largest economy in the region, is the driving force behind much of this dynamic shift in fortunes.</p>
      <p>At this year’s Forbes Global CEO Conference, held last month in Singapore, much of the talk was about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on the global economy. A consensus of sorts emerged that while much of the world may suffer collateral damage from this unfortunate episode, Asia-Pacific’s prospects remain relatively brighter.</p>
      <p>As an example of this trend, the U.S. economy will be hurt by the trade war in ways that aren’t immediately obvious (for how, read Hendrick-Wong’s “Economics Matters” column in this issue). In Asia, the losses for China may be offset by gains elsewhere. Vietnam is one winner, for example, as trade shifts from China to there. Philippine port operator ICTSI is benefitting too from changing trade flows. In these ways, the trade war’s impact may be cushioned on a regional basis, helping underpin Asia-Pacific’s ability to transcend global turbulence, and generate wealth creation and more growth.
