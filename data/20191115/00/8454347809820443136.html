      <p>Nickelodeon deal with Netflix induces a wave of nostalgia. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_boys_2019"><i>The Boys</i></a> celebrates wrap of filming on season 2 by releasing a short on social media.

      <p>TOP STORY</p>
      <h3>COMING SOON TO NETFLIX: NEW NICKELODEON SHOWS, MORE EDDIE MURPHY</h3>

      <p>In an effort to make sure Disney+ doesn’t take away its kiddie viewership, Netflix has signed a multi-year deal with Nickelodeon that will find the companies partnering on new animated movies and series featuring characters from the Nickelodeon universe.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/spongebob_squarepants"><i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i></a> spin-off? A <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/rugrats"><i>Rugrats</i></a> revival? A return to Retroville with Jimmy Neutron? Netflix nor Nickelodeon are offering up any specifics about which Nick characters will be featured in the new projects, though in a statement, Nick’s VP of original animation, Melissa Cobb, said, “Nickelodeon has generated scores of characters that kids love, and we look forward to telling wholly original stories that re-imagine and expand on the worlds they inhabit.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Meanwhile, big-screen sequels haven’t done so well in theaters recently – <i>Terminator</i>: <i>Dark Fate</i>, <i>Shaft</i>, <i>Men in Black: International</i>, for examples – so Paramount’s taking another route with its upcoming <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beverly_hills_cop"><i>Beverly Hills Cop</i></a> sequel: the studio has licensed the rights to make a follow-up film to Netflix.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/eddie_murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> will return to play Alex Foley, the Detroit cop who took his baddie-thwarting skills to the tony California city in two very successful (and one flop, <i>Beverly Hills Cop 3</i>) action-comedy films. The 1984 movie that kicked off the franchise was that year’s highest-grossing film, earned Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, and cemented Murphy as an international movie star.</p>
      <p>The new movie also boosts Murphy’s presence on Netflix, where his current project, the biopic <i>My Name Is Dolemite</i>, has earned great reviews for his portrayal of filmmaker-actor-singer-comedian Rudy Ray Moore, and where he’s making a comeback to stand-up comedy in a 2020 special that will be followed by a comedy tour.</p>

      <h3>A DOUBLE DOSE OF GELLAR</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/buffy-the-vampire-slayer"><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> star <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sarah_michelle_gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> has a good chance of ending up on the Fox network: the actress has not one, but two book adaptation series in development at Fox, including one produced by <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ellen_degeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Sometimes I Lie</i>, a thriller based on the Alice Feeney novel, is about a woman named Amber (Gellar) who’s in a coma. She’s trapped in her body with no memory of how she got there, but she knows it probably has something to do with the people closest to her: a husband who doesn’t love her, a sister with big secrets, and an ex who still wants to be in her life. The series time jumps between Amber’s present, recent past, and her childhood, as she tries to figure out how she ended up in the coma. The actress will produce the series with Robin Swicord, the screenwriter of <i>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</i>, who will also write the <i>Sometimes I Lie </i>script, and DeGeneres’ A Very Good Production company.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Fox gave a script commitment for <i>Other People’s Houses</i>, a dramedy based on the Abbi Waxman novel of the same name. The show follows a group of people in Los Angeles’ Larchmont Village area, largely through their social media interactions, and is said to have much in common with <i>Big Little Lies</i> and <i>Catastrophe</i>. Gellar would play one of the two women in the group of nine neighbors.

      <h3>FX, INCLUDING SOA, ON HULU</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The streaming wars are only going to get worse … for our wallets. Add another reason to keep up that Hulu subscription, as, come next March, the streamer will add original, and legacy, series from FX to its lineup. That means the complete run of essential bingewatch material like <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_americans"><i>The Americans</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/sons_of_anarchy"><i>Sons of Anarchy</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/justified"><i>Justified</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_shield"><i>The Shield</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/archer"><i>Archer</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fargo"><i>Fargo</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/it_s_always_sunny_in_philadelphia"><i>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/american_crime_story"><i>American Crime Story</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/american_horror_story"><i>American Horror Story</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/atlanta"><i>Atlanta</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/rescue-me"><i>Rescue Me</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Current FX series will also stream on Hulu after their FX airings, and new FX series that will debut on Hulu (known officially as “FX on Hulu”) in 2020 include the tech thriller <i>Devs</i>, created by Oscar-nominated <i>Ex Machina</i> screenwriter Alex Garland; the limited series <i>Mrs. America</i>, about the movement to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, with an all-star cast that includes Cate Blanchett, Sarah Paulson, Margo Martindale, Uzo Aduba, Rose Byrne, Elizabeth Banks, and Tracey Ullman; <i>A Teacher</i>, a limited series about the relationship between a female high school teacher (Kate Mara) and her underage student; and <i>The Old Man</i>, a drama starring Jeff Bridges as a retired CIA officer who’s pulled back into the spy game when someone tries to assassinate him.</p>

      <h3>THE BIG BANG THEORY DVDS: A POP-UP BOOK</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/15143615/TBBT-700x380.jpg"/>

      <p>With nearly every bit of video content ever created soon to be hosted on a streaming service – at least, it feels that way – those grand DVD box sets that used to be a fixture of the holiday gift-giving season are much fewer and farther between. But occasionally there’s still a gem to be found, like with the new <i>The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Series</i> on Blu-ray, which is housed inside a colorful book with a pop-up center.</p>
      <p>All 12 seasons of the Emmy-winning CBS comedy, which aired its season finale in May, are included on 25 discs, with almost 12 hours of bonus material, a whole disc of new featurettes, interviews with the cast and producers, and scoop on the show’s many guest stars, the evolution of the characters (Penny was originally a much more disturbed character named Katie), and a 24-minute reel of the gang’s funniest moments from every season. There’s also a 32-page book, full of behind-the-scenes photos, and the whole collection is enclosed in a hardcover red book that opens into a piece of pop-up artwork of all seven main <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_big_bang_theory"><i>Big Bang Theory</i></a> characters.  It’s worth making a little room for on your media shelf.</p>
      <p><i>TBBT</i>, by the way, will begin streaming next year on HBO Max.</p>

      <h3>DISNEY+ HITS 10 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS — YES, ALREADY</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>(Photo by Disney+)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Disney+ launch didn’t go off without a glitch or thousands, but offering movie and TV fans thousands of hours of content for less than the cost of a movie ticket is working out pretty well for the newest streaming service so far; in just one day, Disney+ signed up 10 million subscribers.</p>
      <p>How many of those got the subscription for free, and how many of the ones who signed up for a free trial will stick around are questions left unanswered, but classic films like <i>Lion King</i> and the Marvel movies and new original series like <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_mandalorian/s01"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/high_school_musical_the_musical_the_series/s01"><i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</i></a> have gotten Disney+ one-sixth of the way to its 2024 goal of 60 million worldwide subscribers.</p>
      <p>The service is also making headlines this week as viewers discover “outdated cultural depictions” warnings for some of the movies, including <i>The Aristocats</i> and <i>Lady and the Tramp</i>, both of which include Siamese cats that talk or sing in stereotypical Asian voices.</p>
