      <p>A housewife, simply known as Linda, has landed in trouble in Lagos after she reportedly passionately pleaded with her husband, Okey, to allow her to<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/11/i-didnt-speak-or-have-sex-with-my-wife-for-37-years-iranian-opposition-fighter/"><u><b> sleep with his friend</b></u></a> in order to get pregnant after over 8 years of marriage without a child.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/"><u><b>Naija News</b></u></a> learnt that the incident happened at Agodo Egbe, Ikotun area of Lagos, where they reside.</p>
      <p>The request has put Linda in serious trouble as the husband ordered her out of their matrimonial home for daring to make such demand.</p>
      <p>Linda, now living with her relations in Ikorodu area of Lagos, had been sending emissaries to her husband begging for forgiveness over the demand but he refused.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the husband, Okey, is an international business man, who deals on different wares which he imports for distribution. He is also said to have many choice properties both in Lagos and southeast but the major challenge had been inability to bear a child.</p>
      <p>The couple got married several years ago after their traditional marriage and wedding but since then, they have been childless.</p>
      <p>They were said to have tried both medical and spiritual solutions yet Linda was not able to get pregnant. The doctors had stated that her husband had low sperm count and he was treated to no avail.</p>
