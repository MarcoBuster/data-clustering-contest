      <p><b>the construction of a supportive <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/residential-architecture-interiors/">housing</a> complex for the homeless in <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/architecture-in-los-angeles/">los angeles</a> is underway.</b> named isla intersections, the neighborhood will be made up of <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/shipping-container-architecture/">shipping containers</a> made from recycled steel and welded together to form single 480 square foot units.</p>
      <p><b>designed by <a href="http://loharchitects.com/">lorcan o’herlihy architects</a>, the 35,000 square foot, 54-unit housing unit and adjacent paseo is organized along the spine of broadway street as a series of sixteen staggered boxes.</b> it is situated on a 19,814 square-foot triangular site uniting a traffic island and a former railroad right of way.</p>

      <p><b>each unit is compact and efficient, with an open plan and an ADA kitchen, bathroom, and the living room doubling as a bedroom with a curtain that can be drawn for privacy.</b> the units are stacked and arranged into towers that are connected by a series of walkways to create a single unified building.</p>
      <p><b>to eliminate interruption from the surrounding traffic, a wall of trees and landscape breaks down pollution from freeways whilst providing the necessary green space for the neighborhood.</b> meanwhile, a shared street serves as a space for community events such as fairs and pop-up markets.</p>
      <p><b>one complete, the building will feature 53 apartment for people who have experienced homelessness.</b> the complex will also feature on-site social services provided by <a href="https://afhusa.org/">american family housing</a>, one the project’s co-developers along with <a href="http://cbhousing.org/">clifford beers housing</a>.</p>

      <p><b>in order to reduce the cost and construction time, the architects used a modular container construction that allows concurrent work on and off-site.</b> this condensed construction time to two years instead of four.</p>
      <p><i>‘our aim was to create something that was compartmental but solid, strong enough to withstand the demands of the project’s location but porous enough to engage the residents on a human scale with outdoor activities and places to work and socialize,’</i> <b>explains lorcan o’herlihy architects.</b></p>

        <i>‘therefore, northward along broadway, we shifted heights, stepping down from five stories to two as we approached the single family neighborhood and the adjacent west-facing paseo along more pedestrian-friendly athens way.’</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>‘this reduced roofline strengthens the connection between the building and the annenberg paseo, that runs between the project and a stretch of freeway interchange, creating a ‘slow space’ that preferences pedestrians and bikers along the west side of the site.’</i>

        <i>‘while the project is predominantly residential and green space, the ground level along the paseo will provide a number of storefront spaces for retail, incubation and job training and support services, as well as administrative offices.’</i>
