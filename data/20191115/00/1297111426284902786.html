      <p>The site of the Valley View Centre is up for sale, as part of 200 acres of land haunted by obscure rumours of an ancient burial ground.</p>
      <p>The provincial government is offering the land, which is inside Moose Jaw city limits along the Wakamow Valley, through a request for proposals that closes on Dec. 11. It’s a deadline the Opposition NDP called “rushed” given the archeological potential of the property.</p>
      <p>The sprawling Valley View Centre was built to house as many as 1,500 people with special needs, notably intellectual disabilities. The government announced plans to shut it down in 2012. It began relocating residents to homes across the province, with the process expected to finish next month.</p>
      <p>Twenty-three buildings make up the sprawling centre. Most are about 65 years old. All are included in the land offer, though they only occupy two of the five parcels up for sale.</p>
      <p>Cathy Sproule, an NDP MLA representing Saskatoon Nutana, criticized the pace of the sale in question period on Thursday. She said more consultation and deliberation is required.</p>
      <p>“This land, which skirts the Wakamow River Valley, holds great historical, archeological and ecological significance, with the heritage branch confirming it is a heritage-sensitive site,” she said. “Yet no heritage review has been or will be conducted ahead of the sale.”</p>
      <p>Social Services Minister Paul Merriman took issue with Sproule’s argument. He said there was ample warning and plenty of consultation in advance of the sale, and pledged that the government will do its “due diligence.”</p>
      <p>“We’re not rushing anything; this has been going on for a while,” Merriman said.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Central Services, which manages the government’s property, pointed out that the government sent letters to interested parties, including the City of Moose Jaw and the Wakamow Valley Authority, before holding a public open house on Oct. 30 that attracted about 30 people.</p>
      <p>The ministry said the roughly one-month RFP period is “in alignment with the duration of other government real estate tenders.”</p>
      <p>Sproule was more specific with her concerns when she spoke with reporters after question period. She said there may be an “ancient burial ground” on the land.</p>
      <p>Tom Richards, senior archeologist with the heritage conservation branch of the Ministry of Parks, Culture and Sport, said there are “vague” and “murky” reports that there may have been a Sioux burial ground somewhere on the edge of the property.</p>
      <p>But he said that has never been confirmed and it’s possible the site may have been previously exhumed. But even that isn’t clear.</p>
      <p>He confirmed that the site has been deemed sensitive in terms of archeological heritage. Buried occupation sites have been found nearby that are thousands of years old, including artifacts and bison remains.</p>
      <p>Richards said the heritage conservation branch would get a referral if anyone wants to develop the site or change the land use. There would then be an assessment and, if any significant archeological sites are found, efforts to avoid or salvage them in advance of development.</p>
      <p>But none of that is required in advance of a land sale, according to Richards.</p>
