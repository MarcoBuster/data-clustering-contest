      <p>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Freshman Malik Hall hit a layup with 26 seconds to play and scored all 17 of his points in the second half as No. 3 Michigan State overcame a late five-point deficit and beat No. 12 Seton Hall 76-73 Thursday night in a wildly exciting contest worthy of March Madness.</p>
      <p>Cassius Winston added two free throws with 3.4 seconds to play to push the lead to three points, and the Spartans (2-1) played tough defense on drives in the lane by Sandro Mamukelashvili and Myles Powell in the waning seconds. The Pirates eventually saw a desperation half-court heave by Powell bounce off the top of the rim as the final buzzer sounded.</p>
      <p>Winston scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half, playing his second game in less than a week after the death of his brother, Zachary.</p>

      <p>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Freshman Scottie Lewis scored 15 points in his first start, and Florida escaped with a victory over Towson.</p>
      <p>Graduate transfer Kerry Blackshear Jr. had 13 points and 13 rebounds in his third game with his new team as Florida (2-1) bounced back from a dispiriting home loss to Florida State. Andrew Nembhard had 11 points and nine assists for the Gators.</p>
      <p>Allen Bertrand scored 14 points for the Tigers (2-2), and his 3-pointer with 5:46 remaining gave Towson its last lead at 57-55. But the Tigers struggled from there, going 1 for 6 from the field as Florida ended the game with a 6-0 run.</p>
      <p>NO. 18 SAINT MARY’S 81. LONG BEACH STATE 63</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>MORAGA, Calif. (AP) - Tommy Kuhse had a career-high 20 points and eight assists and Saint Mary’s bounced back three days after losing its home opener and beat Long Beach State.</p>

        <p>Saint Mary’s (2-1) shook off a sluggish start and led by 22 after Kuhse’s third 3-pointer of the second half. Kuhse, who had not scored in the Gaels first two games, was 4 of 4 from beyond the arc.</p>
        <p>The blowout comes after coach Randy Bennett’s team won their first two games by two points, including a 61-59 loss to Winthrop on Monday.</p>
        <p>NO. 19 ARIZON 87, SAN JOSE STATE 39</p>

        <p>Arizona (3-0) dominated a third straight opponent to open the season, shutting down the Spartans (1-2) defensively from the opening tip.</p>
        <p>Nnaji continued the efficient shooting to start his college career. He is a combined 25 for 31 through three games, and he also was 10 of 12 on free throws against the Spartans.</p>
        <p>Eduardo Lane led San Jose State with nine points.</p>
