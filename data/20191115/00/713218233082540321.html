      <h1>A statement from Northbank Community Garden Inc</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Janene Carey</a></address>
      <p>In response to the article in the <i>Bellingen Courier-Sun</i> this Wednesday ('<a href="https://www.bellingencourier.com.au/story/6486645/northbank-community-gardens-uncertain-future/?cs=483">Garden's uncertain future</a>') we would like to shed some light on the matter at hand and provide you with some further information about the gardens and the present situation.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately there was no mention how this garden was created and transformed from an empty, mostly privet filled paddock to what it is now, an established food forest and permaculture garden with amenities, work sheds, workshop spaces with solar power and irrigation. This has come about by many hardworking women, men and families who were not mentioned in Wednesday's article. We also have people paying off fines through community work under the Work Development Order and Work For The Dole programs in progress. Also many varied courses that have been held at the gardens, such as TAFE Cert III Horticulture and the wooden bow making workshop held only a couple of weeks ago.</p>
      <p>It was mentioned we had the chance to purchase the land, which is not entirely true as we have been working to get a subdivision through over the last few years, but due to the current NSW planning laws we have not been permitted to subdivide such a small area of land in this current zoning. This has not due been to a lack of effort or resources on our behalf but in fact the NSW planning laws that have stopped us from purchasing the land that was generously offered to us by John Lavis. This has meant that a boundary adjustment to a direct neighbor has been the only option for John to be able to sell his land.</p>
      <p>Nearly everything we have achieved has been generated from volunteer efforts and with support from other community groups and initiatives. We currently have no funding and rely solely on the work of volunteers and donations from the public</p>
      <p>People have stayed at the garden, sometimes homeless people in situations out of their control. Some people can outstay their welcome but we have had to be empathetic to their situations. People staying there is something we do not encourage. Unfortunately a lack of emergency or temporary accommodation in this area has meant there are many more people needing somewhere to stay and we cannot police or control this 24/7.</p>
      <p>We also do not condone irresponsible drinking of alcohol and have had a no consumption of alcohol policy during daytime working hours or during the running of any of our workshops, Tafe courses, work for the dole or any activities of the like. Inappropriate and excessive consumption of alcohol is problem in our greater community as a whole and in no way do we encourage this.</p>
      <p>As for the weeds, there always has been and always will be, but understand this is not broad scale agriculture, we are following permaculture principles. We are providing food for the community, meeting friends, sharing knowledge and ideas, while working together toward a common goal.</p>
      <p>Socialising and networking at the garden has given people the chance to meet new people, build friendships, learn about gardening, learn about plants and get advice from people with experience and knowledge. There are a lot of different varieties of plants growing at the garden, many not so common in Australia and we are fortunate to have been visited regularly for many years now by refugee families living in Coffs Harbour from all over the world. This has been a great opportunity to learn about cooking and gardening techniques from their culture.</p>
      <p>We have also been a tourist destination since our early days for people from all around Australia and, in fact, the world! We have met some wonderful people who have come from everywhere and who have been of great benefit to the Bellingen Shire.</p>
      <p>Many people, locals and travellers alike have given overwhelmingly positive feedback to what has been created and achieved. Not only the garden itself but for the many community projects that have been initiated by Northbank Gardens, such as the Connell Park planting of citrus trees, Bello Food Box, river revegetation programs and The Bellingen Bee Sanctuary.</p>
      <p>The future of the gardens is uncertain at the moment due to the present situation at Northbank Road, but nothing is set in stone. We will endeavor to keep the garden going as this would be truly a shame to see such valuable community asset lost and people no longer having access to the services we provide.</p>
      <p>We will be holding a Public Meeting, but due to the current fire situation we postponed it from Thursday 14th of November to next Wednesday the 20th of November, 5:30pm at the Northbank Community Garden. Please feel free to come along and participate.</p>
