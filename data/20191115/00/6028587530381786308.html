      <p>Human Head Studios, the developer behind the original <i>Prey</i> (2006) and this year’s <i>Rune II</i>, has undergone a death and subsequent resurrection. The new company, staffed by the exact same team, is being called Roundhouse Studios. Located in Madison, Wisconsin, Roundhouse will pivot immediately to working on “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20962923/bethesda-softworks-buys-human-head-prey-rune-roundhouse-studios">unannounced projects at Bethesda</a>.”“<i>Rune II</i> will be the final game for Human Head Studios,” the developer <a href="https://www.humanhead.com/update-human-head-studios/">announced on Wednesday</a>. “After 22 great years of making games as an independent studio, economic realities have forced us to make the decision to wind down the company and close its doors. But while we are closing the book on Human Head, we are not closing the book on the amazing team we have assembled.”</p>
      <p>“We reached out to our friends at Bethesda for help, and they saw that same creativity and passion in our team,” said Chris Rhinehart, creative director at the new studio, in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20962923/bethesda-softworks-buys-human-head-prey-rune-roundhouse-studios">another press release</a>. “With the formation of Roundhouse Studios, Bethesda offered every employee of Human Head a position at the new company. We are excited our team will remain together, pursuing the work we love, as part of a company we already know and admire.”</p>
      <p>This was all news to Ragnarok, the publisher of Human Head’s newly released <i>Rune II</i>. “This is shocking,” Ragnarok said <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/13/human-head-surprise/">in a statement</a>, “as there are several entities working on <i>Rune II</i>—we found out about this news when you did.”</p>
      <p>Due to the closure of Human Head, the team at Roundhouse won’t fulfill its “longstanding agreement” to deliver ongoing support for <i>Rune II</i>; Ragnarok is instead establishing a new team “that will execute the exciting planned future of <i>Rune II</i>’s post-launch content strategy.”</p>
      <p>Despite recent delays, Bethesda Softworks has a lot on its plate: <i>Fallout 76</i>’s <i>Wastelanders</i> expansion, <i>The Elder Scrolls: Blades</i> on Switch and other new platforms, next year’s <i>Doom Eternal</i>, Arkane’s <i>Deathloop</i>, Tango Gameworks’ <i>GhostWire: Tokyo</i>, <i>Starfield</i>, <i>The Elder Scrolls VI</i>, and MachineGames’ next inevitable <i>Wolfenstein</i> sequel.</p>
