      <h1>Eleven easy ways you can save money and the planet at the same time</h1>
      <h2>Not every plan to help save the planet comes with a price tag attached - in fact we've tracked down 11 ways you can not just be a little kinder to the environment but be better off for it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:49:27+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:49</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Cheap doesn't have to be nasty to the environment, in fact money-saving and planet-saving are based on exactly the same principles - making the best use of the resources we have.</p>
      <p>The two areas where saving cash and helping the environment are most closely aligned are waste and energy.</p>
      <p>In almost all cases if you cut down on either you'll end up richer too - but the question is whether it's worth the effort.</p>
      <p>So - with the twin goals of making the planet safer and you richer, here are the 11 easiest changes you can make:</p>
      <h3>1. Coffee cups</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A re-usable coffee cup can save you up to 50p a time on your caffeine fix.</p>
      <p>Costing from about £3 and up, that will see you saving cash in about 6 coffees time - and they now even sell them at the cafes themselves, designed to look like the paper cups we're so familiar with if you're worried about looking out of place.</p>
      <p>For people still buying disposable ones because they are out and about or have forgotten their re-usable one, they even now make collapsible versions that will fit in a jacket pocket or bag so are always with you.</p>
      <h3>2. Driving</h3>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Switching to a hybrid or electric car could pay off in terms of fuel use over a few years, but the expense of doing so can't be ignored.</p>
      <p>But that doesn't mean you can't be kinder to the planet in your existing car.</p>
      <p>Simple steps like keeping tyre pressures at the correct level, removing accessories like roof boxes or bike racks when not in use and clearing out excess or unneeded items from inside can cut fuel used for the same journeys.</p>
      <p>Avoiding unnecessary braking and acceleration can also save fuel, while keeping speed reasonable and shifting to a higher gear early - at around 2,000 RPM - when driving manual vehicles can also reduce emissions.</p>
      <h3>3.  Water bottles</h3>

        <figcaption>Buy a reusable water bottle (Image: Moment RF)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Most of the time a re-usable water bottle can live in your bag, or on your desk at work, be filled up from a tap and mean you don't need to buy bottled water.</p>
      <p>Like coffee cups, there are also <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%2Fref%3Dnb_sb_noss%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Dsports%26field-keywords%3Dfolding%2Bwater%2Bbottles&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">folding bottles</a> to keep with you, or failing that re-fillable pouches you can roll up when not in use.</p>
      <p>Finding somewhere to fill it up is getting easier too with a recent rise in both <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-reveals-location-of-20-new-water-fountains">public water fountains</a> and places that will <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/costa-coffee-premier-inn-become-11909026">let you fill your own bottles</a>. There's even <a href="https://refill.org.uk/get-the-refill-app/">an app that helps you find them on the go</a> while <a href="http://tapwater.org/">tapwater.org</a> also lists places you can fill up.</p>
      <h3>4. Home energy</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>There are some simple steps that can cut your energy use at home and save you cash too.</p>
      <p>Switching off appliances, rather than leaving them on standby, could reduce bills by around £30 a year. Using a bowl to do the washing up - and not leaving the hot tap running - could save £25 a year, while only filling the kettle as much as you need could save £6 a year.</p>
      <p>Foil - which can be specialist brand or simply kitchen foil - placed behind the radiators on external walls helps too. Costing a few pounds, it reflects heat back into your home rather than outside and saves about £10 a year.</p>
      <h3>5. Razors</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Ditch the single-use razors (Image: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB01GOKPP4A%3Fref_%3Dams_ad_dp_ttl&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">about £10</a> you can buy a traditional straight razor you sharpen yourself that will never need to bin another razor or spend more money on them.</p>
      <p>It's how people shaved for centuries, but if that's a little scary, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%2Fref%3Dnb_sb_noss%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Ddrugstore%26field-keywords%3Dsafety%2Brazor&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">a blade for a traditional safety razor</a> costs about 20p and the experience is remarkably similar to using one of the more expensive modern versions.</p>
      <p>Ditching cans of shaving foam and gels is even easier - for less than a fiver you can buy <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%2Fref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Ddrugstore%26field-keywords%3Dshaving%2Bbrush&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">a traditional shaving brush</a> and turn any bar of soap into shaving foam yourself. Brushes don't last forever, but they do last for years even with daily use.</p>
      <h3>6. Food waste</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Don't bin it if you can possibly avoid it</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Cutting food waste means more cash for you and less carbon emitted.</p>
      <p>Research from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fao.com%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fhow-moving-things-your-fridge-14031836">AO.com</a> estimates we bin about £5.10 worth of food a week (that's £265.20 a year) while a separate study from <a href="http://www.vouchercodes.co.uk/">VoucherCodes.co.uk</a> puts the figure higher at £6.84 a week or £355.68 a year.</p>
      <p>That's food that's been grown, transported, prepared, stored in the shop and then taken home to feed the bin, not you or your family.</p>
      <p>The first thing to do to stop it is get on top of the real use by dates on fresh mean and veg - which can last <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/whats-use-by-date-new-11608519">a lot longer than you think</a>.</p>
      <p>The second thing to do is find a way to eat the odds and ends left over - there are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/brits-waste-250m-food-week-20584529">some tips from Jamie Oliver here</a>.</p>
      <p>The third is to plan better, ideally thinking about what you'll cook before going shopping, but at very least you knowing what's closest to going off so you can eat it before it does.</p>
      <h3>7. Cleaning products</h3>

      <p>Bleach, washing up liquid, surface spray and more come in plastic bottles that you use then bin and replace.</p>
      <p>But advocates of a zero-waste lifestyle think this is pure waste. In fact, they're pretty convinced you can do the lot with vinegar, bicarbonate of soda and maybe half a lemon if you're feeling fancy.</p>
      <p>You can pick it up in bulk with cleaning vinegar costing <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FNatural-White-Vinegar-5l-Pack%2Fdp%2FB074QQQMFF%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3_a_it%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1538050870%26sr%3D8-3%26keywords%3Dcleaning%2Bvinegar&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">about £10 for 2 litres</a> and bi-carb costing <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%2Fref%3Dnb_sb_noss_2%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Dkitchen%26field-keywords%3DBicarbonate%2Bof%2BSoda&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">about £6.50 for 2kg</a> -  and with a little lemon or orange rind thrown in it even smells nice too.</p>
      <h3>8. Washing machine capsules</h3>

        <figcaption>Switching from tabs to powder will let you save a bit of cash (Image: GETTY)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Washing machine capsules come in plastic tubs you throw away - and are far from cheap.</p>
      <p>Switching to powder will let you save a bit of cash and cut down on plastic, but there are products that have a far bigger impact.</p>
      <p>Meet the EcoEgg - a re-usable product that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FEcoegg-Laundry-Egg-720-Washes%2Fdp%2FB0079GAM7E%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">promises 720 washes for £19.99</a> with refills (promising 210 washes) costing £8.99 - that's about a third the price of the best-value capsules we could find.</p>
      <p>Then there are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/soap-nuts-bread-shaving-cream-8421901">soap nuts</a> - natural, organic, sustainable and biodegradable - a kilo <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FEcozone-Soap-nuts-replaces-detergents%2Fdp%2FB00DI7J8AK%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">costs a tenner from Amazon</a> and they reckon it will last you 330 washes.</p>
      <h3>9. Coffee pods and teabags</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Loose-leaf tea is actually cheaper than the bagged variety (Image: Andrés Nieto Porras/Flickr/CC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Micro-plastics in teabags hit the news <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/you-definitely-should-stop-using-9522739">a couple of years ago</a>, but teabags in general are a waste product you really don't need.</p>
      <p>Loose-leaf tea is actually cheaper than the bagged variety, and if you don't fancy making a pot and straining, for a few pounds you can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%2Fref%3Dnb_sb_noss_2%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26field-keywords%3Dtea%2Binfuser%26rh%3Di%253Aaps%252Ck%253Atea%2Binfuser&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">buy a one-cup infuser</a> instead.</p>
      <p>As for coffee pods - well, the first thing to realise is that using a bit of tinfoil means you can <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Refill-Used-Nespresso-Capsules-The-Right-Way/">re-fill them yourself</a> , or if that seems like too much effort - just buy <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%2F%3Fie%3DUTF8%26keywords%3Dre%2Busable%2Bcoffee%2Bpods&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fwaste-not-want-not--13319888">a set of re-usable ones</a>.</p>
      <h3>10. Water waste</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Cutting water waste can save you serious cash (Image: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Using less hot water saves monet and carbon heating it, while using less water overall also help ease the pressure on the environment - as well as save cash if you're on a water meter.</p>
      <p>There are simple steps you can take to reduce your water use that shouldn't affect your life too much.</p>
      <p>First, make sure your taps aren't dripping – fitting washers can save as much as 75 litres a day, each tap. And while we're talking taps, don't leave them running – you can save more than £25 a year turning them off when brushing teeth, shaving, or washing your face.</p>
      <p>Next, only run your washing machine or dishwasher when they're full, while a quick shower will use a lot less water than a bath and you can save even more water with a water-saving shower head.</p>
      <h3>11. Share more</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>If you don't use it more than once a week, could you simply share? (Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Almost everyone has items in their home they need, but rarely use - and that's before we get to the car we make on our own.</p>
      <p>But how often do you actually use your drill, lawnmower or even car?</p>
      <p>A lot of local communities now have <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> groups, where people can ask to borrow for specific items, or lend out their own.</p>
      <p>Then there are the more commercial sites like <a href="https://fatllama.com/">FatLlama</a> that let you rent out your stuff or borrow other people's.</p>
      <p>When it comes to driving, sites like Liftshare (<a href="https://liftshare.com/uk">liftshare.com</a>) and Bla Bla Car (<a href="https://www.blablacar.co.uk/">blablacar.com</a>) let people fill up otherwise empty seats in cars.</p>
