        <b>Jamaican reggae sensation Koffee has been booked by international rock artiste Harry Styles to open three of his shows in Mexico next year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Koffee, with a catalogue of just five songs, has spent the year travelling and performing for fans in all corners of the globe.</p>
      <p>On September 29, she will take the stage to open for the One Direction alum in Mexico at Arena Monterry in Monterrey.</p>
      <p>She will move on to Guadalajara, Mexico on October 1 to perform at the  Arena VFG, then finally on October 3 at Foro Sol in Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Styles made the announcements via his personal social media accounts, exciting fans with extensive upcoming tour dates.</p>
      <p>Other special guests invited to perform with the pop-turned-rock entertainer are Jenny Lewis for North American dates and King Princess for European dates.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Koffee was also invited as an opening act for R&amp;B singer, Daniel Caesar.</p>
      <p>Still, the 19-year-old remains a headliner of her own merit. </p>
      <p>Next month, Koffee jets off to Dubai for an appearance at Sole DXB, a lifestyle and cultural festival, where she will share the stage with colleagues Sevana and Lila Ike. </p>
