      <h1>'Jail illegal fox hunters', says animal welfare poll in general election run-up</h1>
      <h2>The survey by the League Against Cruel Sports will pile pressure on parties to toughen-up sentences</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:01:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Three-quarters of voters want prison sentences for illegal fox hunting, a poll reveals today.</p>
      <p>Those convicted of breaking the 2004 Hunting Act should be locked up, according to the survey for the League Against Cruel Sports.</p>
      <p>The charity claims legal loopholes have allowed hunts to get away with killing foxes and want political parties should commit to toughening the law.</p>
      <p>Campaigns director Chris Luffingham said: “Fox hunting is a barbaric activity which has no place in a modern, compassionate society of animal lovers and yet it is still taking place.</p>

      <p>“Tougher legislation, coupled with the introduction of prison sentences for illegal hunting will help to end the brutal killing of our wildlife.”</p>
      <p>Courts can only fine offenders convicted of hunting offences.</p>
      <p>An online YouGov poll of 1,639 adults on October 29-30 found 74% of those who expressed a view backed prison sentences.</p>
      <p>But there were wide splits in support for beefed-up laws among supporters of different parties.</p>
      <p>Custodial sentences for illegal hunting were backed by 84% of people intending to vote <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> .</p>
      <p>But that fell to 75% of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party supporters, 71% planning to vote Lib Dem, and just 67% of Conservative supporters.</p>

      <p>Labour's Animal Welfare Manifesto published earlier this year pledged a review of punishments for hunting “to ensure it is an effective deterrent, including consulting on the introduction of custodial sentences, bringing it in line with the penalties for other wildlife crimes”.</p>
      <p>The study also showed 79% who expressed a view thought the Hunting Act should be amended to ensure foxes are not killed by hunts, including accidentally, when they claim to be trail hunting.</p>

      <p>Strengthening the Hunting Act to prevent the killing of foxes had the backing of 89% of those intending to vote Labour, 82% of Lib Dem supporters, 71% of Brexit Party supporters, and 68% of Tory voters.</p>
      <p>Hitting back, the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance pointed to its own polling from July showing fewer than one in six adults believed animal welfare was an important rural issue, when asked which three issues they wanted parties to tackle.</p>
      <p>Hospitals and healthcare topped the survey at 49%, followed by local transport links at 37%; affordable housing at 35%; the impacts of Brexit and climate change tied on 27%; 23% for crime; and 20% for internet access and mobile phone coverage.</p>
      <p>Education, immigration and animal welfare were tied on 15%.</p>

      <p>Chief executive Tim Bonner said: “It is quite extraordinary that anyone can think that obsessing over people wearing red jackets, riding horses and taking part in legal activity is a priority at this of all times.</p>
      <p>“Hunts operate legally, prosecutions are incredibly rare and the countryside faces any number of huge challenges from Brexit, to climate change, to flooding.</p>
      <p>“LACS (League Against Cruel Sports) really needs to grow up and focus on real issues that affect rural communities and animal welfare rather than pursuing their petty obsessions.”</p>
