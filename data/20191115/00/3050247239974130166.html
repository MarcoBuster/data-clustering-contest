      <h1>Ingenico Partners with Pundi X to Unlock Android-Based Crypto Payments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:24:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 00:24</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>French payment firm Ingenico has partnered with Singapore-based crypto startup Pundi X to enable its customers to receive payments in crypto using smartphones. </p>
      <p>Pundi X has integrated its point-of-sale payment gateway (XPOS) into Ingenico’s mobile portable POS solution APOS A8, the firm <a href="https://www.ingenico.com/press-and-publications/press-releases/all/2019/11/ingenico-partners-with-fintech-pundi-x.html">announced</a> on Nov. 12. Through this partnership, merchants around the world using Ingenico’s Android-based APOS A8 will now be able to accept a wide number of crypto as payment options.</p>
      <h3>Transactions will be processed directly through Pundi’s XWallet mobile app</h3>
      <p>Specifically, installing the XPOS module on an Ingenico POS terminal will enable payments in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), Binance Coin (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/binance-coin-bnb">BNB</a>), NEM (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/nem-xem">XEM</a>), <a href="https://coin360.com/coin/qtum-qtum">QTUM</a> and other cryptos supported by Pundi X payment ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Transactions with Ingenico’s APOS A8 solution and Pundi’s XPOS module will be processed directly through Pundi’s XWallet mobile app or physical multi-currency crypto card, XPASS, Ingenico said. The firm also noted that POS devices will automatically provide conversion rates between fiat and cryptocurrencies at retail outlets.</p>
      <h3>Pundi X drives adoption in crypto and blockchain industry</h3>
      <p>Marcus Low, senior VP at Asia Pacific of Ingenico Group, claimed that the new partnership is a great way to introduce cryptocurrency as a reliable global payment option.</p>
      <p>Zac Cheah, co-founder and CEO of Pundi X, said that launching crypto payments in Ingenico’s APOS A8 devices will undoubtedly trigger more adoption to crypto and blockchain technology.</p>
      <p>Pundi X has been actively integrating its XPOS solution to global payment tools worldwide. In August, Pundi X <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pundi-x-expands-crypto-payments-to-venezuelan-department-store-chain?utm_source=Telegram&amp;utm_medium=social">partnered</a> with major Venezuelan chain Traki to implement its blockchain-based POS for crypto payments. Previously, the firm announced that its POS gateway will be soon launched in Panama, with blockchain development firm Chainzilla joining the project as a local distributor.</p>
