      <p>Lower Nazareth Township will allow fireworks to be set off at a house of worship as part of a religious celebration.</p>
      <p>Township supervisors Wednesday granted a waiver from its fireworks ordinance restrictions to allow for the Guru Nanak Sikh Society of the Lehigh Valley, 648 Daniels Road, to hold a festival in celebration of Guru Nanak Gurpurab, the marking of the birth of the first Sikh guru and among their most sacred holidays.</p>
      <p>The celebration includes two days of prayer from Nov. 15-17, and is highlighted by a festival to be held from 7-9 p.m. Nov. 16, in which low-grade consumer fireworks will be ignited.</p>
      <p>“The same fireworks allowed by anybody on certain days,” said Preet Bajwa, a founder of the society, which was established in 1999.</p>
      <p>He called Guru Nanak Gurpurab “one of the most important celebrations” of the Sikh community.</p>
      <p>The two-hour celebration will employ standard consumer fireworks, township Solicitor Gary Asteak said as part of his review of the waiver conditions.</p>
      <p>They include the provision that no fireworks be ignited within 150 feet of an occupied dwelling or 300 feet from any building or parking lot, and that only individuals 18 or older light them.</p>
