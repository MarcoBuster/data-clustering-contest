      <h1>Why We Need Female Moderators at Presidential Debates</h1>
      <h2>And why we need more moderators who are women of color.</h2>

      <p>White male journalists continue to report <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/timesupnow/pages/610/attachments/original/1559835784/TIME'S_UP_REPORT_-_Our_Presidential_Debates_Have_a_Democracy_Problem_%28vF%29.pdf?1559835784">most news,</a> especially prime time evening broadcasts. Research conducted by <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/timesupnow/pages/610/attachments/original/1559835784/TIME'S_UP_REPORT_-_Our_Presidential_Debates_Have_a_Democracy_Problem_%28vF%29.pdf?1559835784">Time’s Up</a>, for instance, found that among 132 primary debates in presidential races from 1996 through 2016, 44% had zero female moderators and only 27% had at least one person of color moderating. The fifth<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/msnbc-announces-four-all-star-all-female-moderators-november-debate-n1071026"> Democratic debate</a> will be broadcast by MSNBC in Georgia on November 20th, and will be co-hosted by journalists Rachel Maddow, Andrea Mitchell, Kristen Welker, and Ashley Parker. The all-women moderators—the majority of whom are white women-- in the upcoming Democratic Debate reflect the upward trend of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a> diversity in moderators, and also the lack of racial equity, as Black or Latinx moderators are <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/timesupnow/pages/610/attachments/original/1559835784/TIME'S_UP_REPORT_-_Our_Presidential_Debates_Have_a_Democracy_Problem_%28vF%29.pdf?1559835784">still in the minority</a>.</p>
      <p>Representation matters, and seeing women in positions of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/leadership">leadership</a>, expressing their authority is an important step in challenging patriarchal norms. And it’s also beyond time that we not only hold our politicians accountable for representing the interests of all or their constituents but that we prioritize the election of politicians that are not beholden to a white male bias. <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/timesupnow/pages/610/attachments/original/1559835784/TIME'S_UP_REPORT_-_Our_Presidential_Debates_Have_a_Democracy_Problem_%28vF%29.pdf?1559835784">Debate moderators hold tremendous power</a>, as they decide which questions to ask, shape the conversation at the debate, and convey what is of interest to voters.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do women voters want?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Women want equality. According to a <a href="https://supermajority.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Supermajority_Breakthrough_Campaigns_Report.pdf">comprehensive stud</a>y that surveyed 2,000 women voters across the United States, conducted by Breakthrough Campaigns along with the Supermajority <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/education">Education</a> Fund, women across all demographics do not feel they are treated equally in the United States. For instance, women report that the economy is not working for them and has become worse under the Trump Administration. This is especially true for women of color, and for women who were already struggling financially. Women do not feel valued at work. They report being sexually harassed, paid less than their male colleagues, held back from promotions, and having experienced <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/pregnancy">pregnancy</a> <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias">discrimination</a>. Women also don’t feel safe. The threat or experience of sexual harassment on the street or other public places, along with the constant threat of sexual assault, are reminders that safety is a privilege for some women but should be a right for all women. Women also report that their bodies are not respected. Their health concerns are not taken as seriously as men’s and women want to have control over their reproduction. Lastly, women want a representative government that reflects the diverse backgrounds, races, and genders of their constituents.</p>
      <p>
        <b>There are no women’s issues</b>
      </p>
      <p>Women are not a “special interest group,” and women’s issues are relevant for everyone. Closing the wage gap and raising the minimum wage helps stabilize a family’s income. <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/reports/guns-intimate-partner-violence/">Gun control policies </a>that restrict domestic abusers' access to guns help keep everyone safe. <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/gender-and-climate-change">Climate change </a>disproportionally affects<a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/how-climate-change-affecting-women"> women's and girl’s health</a>, and also affects families and communities. Most women don’t get pregnant alone. Women’s issues affect everyone, and <a href="https://supermajority.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Supermajority_Breakthrough_Campaigns_Report.pdf">women voters report </a>that categorizing social issues as relating to women tells men that this is not their concern when in fact they are everyone’s concern.</p>
      <p>Currently, the United States Congress is comprised of only 24% of women. In order for women of all demographics to achieve equality, we need more institutional power. That means representation in leadership positions that include the government, media, and law so that we are the ones making the decisions that affect our lives.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What questions should the moderators ask?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The questions that the moderators ask should reflect the concerns and priorities of voters. In the upcoming debate, moderators should ensure at the very least the following questions related to gender equality should be answered by each candidate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is your plan to ensure that the economy works for everyone, particularly low-income women of color? Will your plan include raising the minimum wage, and provide quality, affordable childcare? Does your plan also include mandatory paid family and medical leave?</li>
        <li>What solutions do you propose to protect women from sexual harassment?</li>
        <li>What policies would you implement to close the wage and opportunity gap, particularly for lesbian, bisexual, trans, and women of color?</li>
        <li>If you are elected president, how will you protect women’s reproductive rights and high rates of maternal mortality, especially for black women?</li>
        <li>What specifically will you do to address the epidemic of sexual violence against women and girls?</li>
        <li>Now that the deadline has been lifted, what is your plan to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's time that the priorities and concerns of women take center stage in the debates, and who's asking the questions and shaping the conversation matters.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Frank on November 15, 2019 - 1:42pm</p>
      <p>Back in 1995, Congressional Democrats created the Office of Women's Health, but ignored men's health, both at that time and ever since - despite the 6 year shorter average male life expectancy, and the fact that men die at younger ages and in greater numbers from every major cause of death in the USA.</p>
      <p>Despite decades of research that has found that women batter men as often as the converse, Congressional Democrats only passed the Violence Against Women Act, which ignores female-om-male violence, and the fact that men are twice more often victims of violent crime.</p>
      <p>The research that found that women batter men as often as the converse goes back to the mid-1970s. At that time, feminist thugs didn't want that information to get out, so they made death threats against the researchers, Drs. Suzanne Steinmetz, Murray Straus and Richard Gelles.</p>
      <p>Reproductive tights? Women have them, men do not. The last time a feminist acknowledged that issue was when Karen DeCrow represented Frank Serpico in court, after his girlfriend got pregnant after having stopped taking her birth control pills without informing him. She argiued that if women have sole reproductive decision making, they should bear sole parental responsibility if the man decides he doesn't want to be a father. Serpico won initially, but lost on appeal.</p>
      <p>Paternity fraud is also common: a gay physicist in Texas tried to renew his driver license, but was denied that as he found out that there was an unpaid child support order against him. It turned out that a welfare mother wanted a high-income man to pay her child support, so she got his name from Facebook, and fraudulently named him as the father.</p>
      <p>If there was the equality that feminists speak of. women would be required to register for the military draft, and be subject to conscription, as men are.</p>
      <p>Men are routinely destroyed in divorce court. Augustine Kposawa found that the post-divorce suicide risk increases EIGHT times for men, but remains unchanged for women. As a result, the marriage rate continues to fall, and more men are going MGTOW and avoiding interactions with women entirely.</p>
      <p>I could go on all day, but this is a good start.</p>

      <p>Submitted by Frank on November 15, 2019 - 1:57pm</p>
      <p>International Women's Day was on March 8.</p>
      <p>International Men's Day is November 19.<br/>It's curious that feminists that speak of equality make no mention of a comparable day for men.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by eric prince on November 15, 2019 - 4:42pm</p>
      <p>In this article you talk about having too many males and not enough females as moderators in presidential debates. How can it be wrong to only have men when you seem quite happy to have only women? Equality would demand some of each but I guess that is lost on a feminist version of equality of women only.</p>

      <p>Thank you, Eric. Having a women-only moderator panel is the feminist definition of equality.</p>
      <p>If feminism was really about equality, they would march down to every Selective Service System office in the country, and demand that women have the same obligation that men have to register for the military draft,</p>
