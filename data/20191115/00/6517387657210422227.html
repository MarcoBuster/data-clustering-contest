      <h1>Find out which song and artist your John Lewis Christmas advert would be</h1>
      <h2>Which current artist is singing a classic for your John Lewis Christmas advert?</h2>

      <p>This year's John Lewis Christmas advert has been unveiled, and with it the trailer's soundtrack - a cover of REO Speedwagon's 1984 hit Can't Fight This Feeling by Bastille. </p>
      <p>The theme song for the highly anticipated advert usually sees a current artist covering a classic. For their 2012 festive trailer, Gabrielle Aplin released a haunting take on Frankie Goes To Hollywood's 1984 chart-topper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNpeK7sDLzE">The Power Of Love, </a>while the 2010 advert was soundtracked by a cover of Elton John's 1970 hit Your Song by Ellie Goulding.</p>
      <p>Spotting the trend, a Twitter user asked people what their John Lewis Christmas advert soundtrack would be, by taking the song that was Number 1 on your eighth birthday and adding it to the artist who was Number 1 on your birthday in 2017. </p>

      <p>Make sense? We're not entirely sure either, but you can't <i>not</i> test the theory, right? The post on Twitter has already had over 3,500 replies and turned out some brilliant results. </p>
