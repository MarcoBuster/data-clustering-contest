      <p>BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi medical and security officials say one protester was killed and over 40 were wounded in renewed clashes overnight in central Baghdad.</p>
      <p>Protesters have called for large protests to take place on Friday as Iraqi authorities continue to clamp down on the anti-government demonstrations.</p>
      <p>The officials say the clashes happened in the Khilani area, not far from the epicenter of the protest movement in Tahrir Square, hours after demonstrators celebrated Iraq’s 2-1 World Cup qualifier win over Iran.</p>
      <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International has said that security forces in Baghdad have fired tear gas grenades directly into the crowd. But Defense Minister Najah al-Shammari said Thursday an investigation has confirmed the tear gas cannisters responsible for protester deaths were not purchased by the government.</p>
