      <p>Ohio State made headlines this week as the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackjones/2019/11/12/ohio-state-vs-rutgers-sees-historic-betting-spread-largest-dog-in-modern-football-history/#7727874a5cb0">biggest favorite</a> in Big Ten history when they play at Rutgers as a 52.5 point favorite. At William Hill sportsbooks across the country, 94% of the money is on the Buckeye’s laying more than 50 points. Ohio State still plays No. 9 Penn State and No. 15 Michigan before a potential Big Ten championship game. A win at Rutgers followed by a home win over Penn State would secure a spot for Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game regardless of the result at rival Michigan. However, the Buckeye’s are playing for more than just a Big Ten title as one of the favorites to reach the college football playoff.</p>
      <p>No. 3 Clemson is a 34-point favorite at home this week against Wake Forest. The Tigers have a bye next week before the regular season finale at state-rival South Carolina. The ACC championship game follows against Virginia.</p>
      <p>The biggest game this Saturday is No. 4 Georgia at No. 12 Auburn, and Georgia is a 2.5-point favorite with 63% of the spread bets and 71% of the money on Georgia (-2.5) at <a href="https://www.williamhill.com/us/">William Hill sportsbooks</a>. A win by Georgia this week or next week at Texas A&amp;M secures the Bulldogs spot in the SEC championship game. Auburn and Alabama still have their huge rivalry game Nov. 30 at Auburn.</p>

      <p>The Minnesota Golden Gophers upset Penn State 31-26 for the programs biggest win in decades. That was another big result in favor of the sportsbooks, as a majority of the bets and money was on Penn State (-6.5). The victory moved undefeated Minnesota (9-0) to No. 8 in the CFP poll and the Gophers made the biggest move after ranking No. 17 in the the opening<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayginsbach/2019/11/09/big-game-betting-lsu-at-alabama-headlines-initial-college-football-playoff-rankings/#4d54e95b7c7c"> college football playoff poll</a> last week.</p>
      <p>The Gophers are still a big longshot to make the college football playoff, but a trip to the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1962 is well within reach for Minnesota. The Gophers are a 3-point underdog this week at Iowa, where they have not won since 1999. But a victory over the Hawkeye’s and next week at Northwestern would secure the Big Ten West title and put the Gophers into the Big Ten championship game. Regardless of wins or losses the next two weeks, a victory over No. 14 Wisconsin in the season finale Nov. 30 would also put Minnesota into the Big Ten championship game where even a loss likely sends the Gophers to the Rose Bowl against the Pac-12 champion.</p>
      <p>No. 6 Oregon and No. 7 Utah are on a collision course to play in the Pac-12 championship game as long as Utah wins their final three games as favorite or USC loses once. Utah is a 21.5-point favorite over UCLA this Saturday while Oregon is a 27-point favorite over Arizona with both teams playing at home.</p>
      <p>The Pac-12 conference currently sends the winner of the Pac-12 championship game to the Rose Bowl or College Football playoffs. The Alamo Bowl has the second pick of teams after the Rose Bowl and/or New Year's Six games are decided.</p>
      <h4>When is the 2019 College Football Playoff semifinals?</h4>
      <p>The CFP semifinals are set for Dec. 28, 2019. One semifinal is the Peach Bowl from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The other semifinal is the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona.</p>
