      <h1>Taylor Swift Asks Fans For Help After Being Denied The Right To Perform Her Old Songs At The AMAs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Mench</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a>’s business <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-on-scooter-braun-acquiring-her-back-catalog-this-is-my-worst-case-scenario">drama with Scooter Braun and Big Machine Records</a> continues to snowball, and she’s asking fans for help. In a lengthy note posted to her social media on Thursday night, Swift revealed that Braun and Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta have denied her the right to perform any of her old songs at the upcoming American Music Awards, where she will be <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-will-be-named-artist-of-the-decade-at-the-2019-american-music-awards">honored as the Artist of the Decade</a> and was set to perform a medley of her old hits.</p>
      <p>She further stated that she likely won’t be able to perform any of her pre-<i>Lover</i> material at any recorded event until her contract expires next November. Even a planned Netflix documentary, which she revealed in the note, will be put on hold because Braun and Borchetta have allegedly denied her request to use her old music and video footage:</p>

      <p>Swift ends the note by urging fans to encourage other artists that Braun manages to take up her cause. Braun works closely with superstars like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Demi-lovato">Demi Lovato</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/J-balvin">J Balvin</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Carly-rae-jepsen">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Swift <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-on-scooter-braun-acquiring-her-back-catalog-this-is-my-worst-case-scenario">went public with the fact that Braun had purchased Big Machine Records</a>, and with it, the rights to the master recordings of her vast and lucrative back catalog of music. She has feuded with Braun for years and expressed how upset she was that he controlled her life’s work. Swift recently claimed that she <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-plans-to-re-record-her-old-songs-to-combat-scooter-braun-deal">plans to re-record her old music</a> once she is contractually allowed to do so in November 2020. <i>Lover</i> was her first album released outside Big Machine Records, and the first to which she controls her own masters.</p>
