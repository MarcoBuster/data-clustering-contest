      <p>The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage has deemed Sydney’s air quality “poor”, as smoke from bushfires on the mid-north coast is pushed south. The smoke is set to hang around until a southerly change pushes it away tonight.</p>
      <p>NSW Health has issued a statement to remind people to take care of their health as Sydneysiders <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/city-file/article/sydneys-air-quality-hazardous-today">choke through another day</a> of smoky weather, a consequence of the tragic, ongoing bushfires up north. The department says that smoke contains fine particles that can affect health and can cause sore eyes, noses and throats.</p>
      <p>Those with lung and heart conditions are advised to avoid physical activity. People with asthma should keep their medication with them at all times.</p>
      <p>“The best way to reduce exposure to smoke is to stay indoors with the doors and windows shut,” NSW Health’s director of environmental health Doctor Richard Broome said in a statement. “Air conditioning can also help to filter particles from indoor air.”</p>
      <p>While the fire danger for Greater Sydney isn’t <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/city-file/article/fires-sydney-region-expected-much-worse-leading-radio-sirens-hour-every-hour-dozens-schools-close">as bad as it was on Tuesday</a> – when it was <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/city-file/article/state-emergency-declared-nsw-65-bushfires-blaze-across-state">rated “catastrophic” for the first time in history</a> – there’s still a “severe” fire weather warning and a statewide fire ban. There are currently 61 bush and grass fires burning across the state; 32 of those are uncontained. The closest out-of-control fire is at Gospers Mountain in the Hawkesbury area.</p>
