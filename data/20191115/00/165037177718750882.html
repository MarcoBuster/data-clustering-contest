      <h1>Haaland is compared to Odegaard: "The 'hype' is the same"</h1>

        <b>Alf Ingve Berntsen was Haaland's coach in the youth categories and has compared the hype surrounding the striker with the mediatic storm Odegaard generated when he signed for Real Madrid.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an interview for 'Goal', Alf Ingve Berntsen has analysed Haaland's current situation and has made it clear that this is <b>not the time for him to play for some big club in Europe.</b></p>
      <p>"The <b>tactical requirements at Bayern and Liverpool are too high for now.</b> After all, he has only played in Norway and Austria, and for a short time," he said.</p>
      <p>The coach has been following his progress since he trained for the youth leagues, and he already felt he had the ability to do great things in European football, <b>but all in good time.</b></p>

      <p><b>"To sign for Bayern now would be difficult for him.</b> He is far from Lewandowski's level and getting to Bayern wouldn't make sense. What many forget is that Haaland didn't play regularly at Salzburg until very recently. He's generated a lot of hype," he continued.</p>
      <p>In fact, Alf Ingve Berntsen compared it with the media storm Odegaard raised in his day: "It's a 'hype' similar to the one Odegaard had. People are taken aback with Haaland by Odegaard, but there are hopes that both of them will lead a new and successful era. <b>Erling is being better protected than Odegaard." </b></p>
