      <p>The Star Trek actor made the pointed remarks during a night in which his contributions to the world of TV and film was celebrated at the Irish Post Awards</p>
      <p>Meaney received the coveted Lifetime Achievement Award for a career spanning more than four decades.</p>
      <p>“I feel very honoured,” he told the Irish Post. “It was a bit of a surprise but a very welcome one”.</p>
      <p>“The Irish Post does a great job,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“I’m old enough, unfortunately, to remember when it started. It’s grown into a really comprehensive international newspaper and it is really impressive.</p>
      <p>“I think especially nowadays it does an excellent job of explaining Ireland to the British, which is quite a task.”</p>
      <p>With 127 acting credits to his name, according to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000538/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"><i><b>IMDB</b></i></a>, Meaney has plenty of highlights to look back on.</p>
      <p>“I got a Golden Globe nomination for The Snapper. That was great. Doing those three Roddy Doyle films was tremendous.</p>
      <p>"Getting to play the same character three times, was wonderful.”</p>
      <p>However, some of his favourite work has come in films that largely went under the radar.</p>
      <p>“Surprisingly, it’s not the ones that people think,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There are other films that maybe didn’t get as big an audience – <i>How Harry Became A Tree</i> is one that I loved."</p>

      <p>The drama, set in rural Ireland, saw Meaney star as Harry Maloney, a farmer who sets out to ruin George O’Flaherty, the local publican and matchmaker, played by <i>Line of Duty</i> star Adrian Dunbar.</p>
      <p>Things are complicated further when Harry’s son Gus (Cillian Murphy) falls for George’s daughter Eileen (Kerry Condon).</p>
      <p>Haunted by the death of his eldest son and a strange dream in which he quite literally turns into a tree, Harry’s scheme soon begins to take shape in this occasional surreal and strikingly unique film.</p>
      <p>It’s a project that holds a special place in Meaney’s memory.</p>
      <p>“The director, Goran Paskaljević is a superb,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, it didn’t find an audience. It screened at Venice film festival in 2001 and then 9/11 happened and everything went crazy.”</p>
      <p>No interview with Meaney would be complete without a mention of <i>Star Trek</i>.</p>
      <p>With much of his work taking him to the US, the Irishman admits he is still occasionally approached by fans of the show.</p>
      <p>It’s hardly a surprise – he appeared in 225 episodes, which is the second highest of any actor in the franchise’s history. He has no regrets about doing the show though.</p>
      <p>“I enjoyed Star Trek,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I did it for seven years. Seven years in a space suit was enough but it was very enjoyable. <i>Star Trek</i> fans still speak to me in the street.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes it’s like I’m two different actors with two different careers,” Meaney adds, “the <i>Star Trek</i> career and the other career “.</p>
