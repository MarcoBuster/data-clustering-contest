      <p>FC Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde explained on Friday his reason for picking Ousmane Dembele over Ansu Fati against Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>"It was a game for both players," Valverde said in a news conference ahead of the weekend's La Liga game against Celta Vigo at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>"Dembele started, but it was very tight and that made it difficult to run. In the second half, it was better, but I opted to change it."</p>
      <p>As for Ansu Fati, he commented that "I'm seeing him better coming on off the bench with the game already going than from the start."</p>

      <h3>"HE DOEs amaZINg THIngS"</h3>
      <p>Sticking with Dembele, who Barça played 105 million for in 2017, Valverde added that "he does amazing things and we want him to do them all the time."</p>
      <p>He continued: "He has to toughen up when he receives the ball, especially when he receives it with his back to the opponent. We have a great player (in Dembele), he gives us a lot and we hope for more."</p>
