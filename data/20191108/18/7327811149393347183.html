      <p>EAST ELMHURST, Queens (WABC) -- A man was fatally stabbed during an argument outside a family shelter in Queens Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>It happened at the Landing Family Shelter on Ditmars Boulevard next to LaGuardia Airport in East Elmhurst.</p>
      <p>The building is called the Landing Hotel, but it is actually a homeless shelter for families.</p>
      <p>Investigators arrived at the scene shortly before 10 p.m. to find a 38-year-old man unconscious and unresponsive outside the shelter with a stab wound to his torso.</p>
      <p>The victim, Abdul Silas, was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Police say he lived at the shelter for about a year.</p>
      <p>Back in 2015, some neighbors complained that the city converted the hotel to a shelter without enough notice or input.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> Police announced the arrest of 34-year-old Ricardo Henry in connection with this case. They say Henry was evicted from the homeless shelter last month and stabbed Silas as part of an ongoing dispute.</p>
