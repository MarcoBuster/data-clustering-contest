      <p>HUNTS POINT, Bronx (WABC) -- If it feels like the sky has been falling for the MTA, that is because in a way it has.</p>
      <p>Eight times this year alone, <a href="https://7ny.tv/2pXtGVo">debris has fallen from elevated subway tracks</a>.</p>
      <p>And some of these incidents have been very scary. In some cases, people came just inches from very serious injury.</p>
      <p>So on Friday MTA officials unveiled how they have chosen to deal with the falling debris.</p>
      <p>The plan centers on the wire baskets under elevated subway tracks, which are supposed to catch and hold loose debris. They have not.</p>
      <p>So the transit agency deployed new management to focus on this issue.</p>
      <p>MTA Chief Track Officer Terri Rumph unveiled new designs for the baskets and new designs for fastenings that have been now been installed over 60 miles of elevated track.</p>
      <p>That Herculean task took place over the last eight days and is now complete.</p>
      <p>The MTA says it can't guarantee there won't be more falling debris.</p>
      <p>But MTA President Andrew Byford said the agency CAN guarantee this:</p>
      <p>"We are doing are our damnedest to stop these incidents from happening. This is not a new phenomenon. These elevated structures have been up a long time, and it has been a challenge for decades to stop debris from falling from elevated structures. We're basically fighting gravity."</p>
      <p>Byford added that the rate of falling debris has not increased, but the recent incidents have been especially high-profile.</p>
      <p>He said there IS money in the budget to net the entire system if need be.</p>
