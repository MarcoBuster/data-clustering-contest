      <h1>Nayoa Inoue's latest victory again proves brilliance of World Boxing Super Series</h1>
      <h2>Inoue saw off Nonito Donaire in Japan in a sensational bantamweight unification scrap that was the latest example of the Super Series' brilliance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:52:18+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author">Barry McGuigan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/barry-mcguigan/</a></address>
      <p>The World Boxing Super Series has proved yet again what a sensational concept it is.</p>
      <p>Too often in the past the myriad boxing organisations and broadcast interests would get in the way of each other and the best would not fight the best as often as they should.</p>
      <p>Money has a way of cutting through that and by paying boxers generously the WBSS has found a way to get around all the politics to give us amazing fights.</p>
      <p>Nayoa Inoue’s sensational bantamweight unification showdown with Nonito Donaire in Japan on Thursday was just the latest example.</p>
      <p>Donaire has been fighting two divisioins higher than his ideal weight. Coming back down to bantam has shown him at his formidable best.</p>

      <p>It took a right hand to the head and left to the body in the 11th to finish him, shots of the highest class.</p>
      <p>Inoue is the standard bearer in the lighter weights and finished like a train, but up until the penultimate round Donaire was bang in the fight.</p>
      <p>I can’t tell you how exciting it has been to be persoinally invovled in the WBSS franchise. And through it Josh Taylor has made his reputation.</p>
      <p>Sixteen fights into his career he is enjoying his rest as a two belt world champion, Ring Magazine champion and holder of the Muhammad Ali Trophy.</p>
      <p>Without the WBSS Taylor and Regis Prograis, arguably fight of the year, would not have been matched so early.</p>
      <p>The same with Oleksandr Usyk and Murat Gassiev, who produced a classic in the cruiserweight final before stepping up to heavyweight.</p>

      <p>Of course there are some great fighters that have not taken part, but absence did not diminish the tournament nor discredit the concept.</p>
      <p>There are many problems facing the old game as recent fatalities have demonstrated, and the challenge faced by growth or rival contact sports has shown</p>
      <p>But what boxing has proved in this series is that if you get it right it surpasses every other sport on the planet for seat-of-the-pants drama and excitement.</p>
      <p>We have to get the medical side sorted out, no doubt. But there is so much the sport has to offer.</p>
      <p>Two fight-of-the-year contenders in the past two weeks proves that. My congratulations to Inoue and Donaire, and the WBSS for making it happen.</p>
