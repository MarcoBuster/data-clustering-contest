      <h1>Alexa Gets a Voice-Activated Crossword Puzzle for Her Birthday</h1>

      <p>It was Alexa's birthday this week, so if you didn't get her anything, she's probably livid. She got something for you - a new skill.</p>
      <p>As long as you have an Alexa-enabled device with a screen, you can play daily crossword puzzles with up to 10 clues for free, with a new one each day. And if you get a kick out of that little taster, you can upgrade to a Puzzler Premium subscription, which gets you beefier crosswords of up to 20 clues, and up to 84 of them per month.</p>
      <p>“We believe in the power of voice to create more interactive experiences for people and to deliver greater engagement for brands. Puzzler Media has a history of evolving their content in a fast-moving market and we are proud to partner with them to create this voice-activated experience, bringing an exciting new dimension to the world of crosswords and puzzles," said Richard Matthews, CEO and Founder of Vocala, who developed the skill along with Puzzler Media.</p>
      <p>If you give it a whirl and decide you'd like to shell out for the premium subscription, there's a free seven day trial, and after that, it'll cost you £2.99 per month.</p>
