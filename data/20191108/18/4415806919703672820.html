      <p>Sir Michael Caine is joined by Rita Ora, Lena Headey and Raff Law in the first picture from a new film version of Oliver Twist.</p>
      <p>The forthcoming Sky Cinema film, called Twist, is a modern take on Charles Dickens’ classic novel.</p>
      <p>The titular character, played by Law, has been reinvented as a “streetwise artist” who lives on the streets of modern-day London.</p>

      <p>It is the acting debut for 23-year-old Law, the son of Jude Law and Sadie Frost.</p>
      <p>Two-time Oscar-winner Sir Michael plays master thief Fagin, while singer Ora portrays Dodge, a charismatic character based on the Artful Dodger.</p>
      <p>Game Of Thrones star Headey is Fagin’s psychopathic business partner Sikes.</p>
      <p>This new interpretation of the much-loved Dickens novel will see Twist have a chance encounter with a gang of grifters led by Dodge.</p>
      <p>Twist is caught up in a high-stakes heist to steal a priceless painting for Fagin and Sikes.</p>
      <p>The cast also includes David Walliams, Legends Of Tomorrow star Franz Drameh and Daybreak actress Sophie Simnett.</p>
      <p>Walliams plays Losberne, Drameh is Batesey and Simnett plays Red.</p>
      <p>Twist, which is currently being filmed in London, will be available on Sky Cinema the same day as its theatrical release.</p>
