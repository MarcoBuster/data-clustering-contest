      <h1>Kilwinning Rangers ace Carlo Monti reveals mindset behind side's top of the table surge</h1>
      <h2>Monti reckons dressing room inquest held in the wake of shock Junior cup exit was a real watershed moment for team.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:10:16+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:10</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>Carlo Monti has revealed how a ‘sink or swim’ mindset is behind Kilwinning Rangers’ surge to the West Premiership summit.</p>
      <p>The Buffs moved four points clear at the top of the table thanks to a 1-0 victory at championship contenders Pollok on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Monti’s stunning free-kick was the difference as Chris Strain’s men made it four league wins on the bounce.</p>
      <p>The strong run of form has been built on the back of last month’s shock Scottish Junior Cup exit at the hands of Bridge of Don Thistle.</p>
      <p>And Monti reckons the dressing room inquest held in the wake of that defeat was a real watershed moment for the team.</p>
      <p>He said: “We had a meeting amongst ourselves after we got put out the Scottish. We knew ourselves it wasn’t good enough and that standards had dropped.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The reaction was sink or swim and, to be fair, we’ve not moped about with the petted lip.</p>
      <p>“We’ve pulled our socks up and got on with it and the last few weeks have been good.</p>
      <p>“Nothing’s won just now but it puts us in a good position in the table.”</p>
      <p>Modest Monti played down his moment of magic against Lok, insisting a solid team performance earned a priceless three points.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “We came with the mentality and game plan that we weren’t going to be messed about the way we were at home in the reverse fixture.</p>
      <p>“We had the bit between our teeth with the carrot dangled in front of us to go points clear with a game in hand.</p>
      <p>“It was a physical game but you can’t play pretty football every week – and I’ll tell you what, we got what we needed out of the game. It was that good a team performance.”</p>
      <p>Buffs are on first round West of Scotland Cup duty this weekend with a home tie against League One leaders Shettleston.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Monti added: “We can take stock with the cup game and it gives us a chance to regroup and evaluate where we are.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we can keep the momentum going through November and into the Christmas period, pick up <br/>points and see where we are.”</p>
