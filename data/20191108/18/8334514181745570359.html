      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. national-security adviser told lawmakers leading an impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump there was “no ambiguity” that a U.S. ambassador told Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, according to testimony released on Friday.</p>
      <p>“There was no ambiguity, I guess, in my mind. He was calling for something, calling for an investigation that didn’t exist into the Bidens,” Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman said, referring to Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.</p>
      <p>Vindman, who serves on the White House National Security Council, said the U.S.-Ukraine relationship “is damaged” and “will continue to be damaged and undercut.”</p>
