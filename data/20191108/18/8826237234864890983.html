      <h1>Colorado Synagogue Bomb Suspect to Remain in Jail</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:36:35+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>(DENVER) â€” A man arrested on suspicion of plotting to bomb a historic Colorado synagogue will remain in jail for now.</p>
      <p>Richard Holzer appeared briefly Friday in federal court in Denver and waived his right to have the evidence against him reviewed.</p>
      <p>His attorney, Mary Butterton, told the judge magistrate that Holzer would not fight his jail detention at this time but may do so later.</p>
      <p>Holzer, who was shackled and wearing a yellow jumpsuit, watched the brief proceedings from the jury box in the courtroom.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was arrested Nov. 1 after the FBI said he accepted what turned out to be phony explosives to bomb Temple Emanuel in Pueblo.</p>
      <p>After the hearing, Butterton declined to comment on the allegations against Holzer.</p>
