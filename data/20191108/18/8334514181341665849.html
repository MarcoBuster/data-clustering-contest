      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - A man who tried to rob Arsenal players Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac at knifepoint in a failed North London carjacking last July was sentenced to 10 years in jail on Friday.</p>
      <p>The BBC reported that Ashley Smith, 30, was sentenced at Harrow Crown Court after admitting trying to steal watches worth 200,000 pounds ($255,440.00) from the Premier League players.</p>
      <p>An accomplice, 26-year-old Jordan Northover, had also admitted involvement in the attack and was awaiting sentencing.</p>
      <p>Judge Ian Bourne described Smith as a “career criminal” who was well known to police.</p>
      <p>Former Germany midfielder Ozil was driving his black Mercedes in North London when the car was boxed in by motorbike riders wearing helmets on July 25.</p>
      <p>Video images showed Bosnian defender Kolasinac, who was a passenger, getting out of the vehicle and confronting the attackers.</p>
      <p>Both players were then left out of Arsenal’s team for the season-opening game.</p>
