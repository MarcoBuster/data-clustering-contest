      <p>Amazon is <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounting</a> the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6, putting it on sale for just $549. That's $100 off of its regular price. But that's not it.</p>
      <p>There is also a free offer that you can add when you purchase the Galaxy Tab S6, that will get you a free $50 gift card, with your purchase. Making it an even sweeter deal.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Tab S6 is the latest and greatest tablet from Samsung. It sports a 10.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display, powered by the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Luckily, Samsung did not ditch the micro SD card slot, so you can still expand the storage, should you need a bit more space on the Galaxy Tab S6. Which is definitely a really nice feature to have.</p>

      <p>With the Galaxy Tab S6 you are also getting quad speakers, which are tuned by AKG. Basically, making this an entertainment powerhouse. Giving you a great sounding tablet, and that OLED display, it'll change how you watch movies and videos on your tablet. There's also Dolby Atmos support here, for some really great sounding audio.</p>
      <p>Samsung has bundled the S Pen with the new Galaxy Tab S6, so you can do some drawing, take notes and much more. It attaches to the back of the tablet, so that you'll never lose it â€“ and so it can charge wirelessly. Much like the S Pen on the Galaxy Note 9 and Note 10, it also needs to be charged since it can do some unique stuff with Bluetooth.</p>
      <p>This is perhaps the best Android tablet on the market right now, and at just $549, it's definitely worth picking up. Just make sure to add that $50 gift card to your cart too!</p>
