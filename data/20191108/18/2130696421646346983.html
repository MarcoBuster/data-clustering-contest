      <p>MAINBOARD-LISTED CapitaLand has sold a serviced residence in Hong Kong for HK$581.8 million (S$101 million) to an unnamed third party, according to a bourse filing on Friday.</p>
      <p>The blue-chip developer said that it has divested fully from a unit that owns Citadines Mercer Hong Kong in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong, in line with a strategy to rejig the property portfolio.</p>
      <p>CapitaLand added that the price tag - which was reached on a willing buyer, willing seller basis - took into account the net asset value of the property owner, as well as the agreed value of Citadines Mercer Hong Kong, which was pegged at HK$740.8 million as at Oct 31.</p>
      <p>CapitaLand’s wholly owned serviced residence unit, The Ascott, had bought the property - now deemed to be at “the optimal stage of its life cycle” - for HK$545 million, back in 2014.</p>
      <p>The divestment is not expected to have any material impact on the net tangible assets or earnings per share of the group for the year to Dec 31, CapitaLand said.</p>
