      <p>Hugo Ortega's name is well-known in Houston. He's the executive chef and co-owner at four top local restaurants - Hugo's, Backstreet Caf√©, Xochi and Caracol. <br/><br/>Last year, he won Best Chef of the Southwest at the prestigious James Beard Awards. But he never forgets his roots. <br/><br/><br/>Growing up in rural Mexico, he herded 300 goats and learned to grind corn for masa.
