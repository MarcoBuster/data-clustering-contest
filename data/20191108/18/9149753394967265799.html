      <p>Gaming laptops are typically more expensive than their desktop counterparts, but today you can grab this <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Laptop-Omen-Headset-NVIDIA-HP-RAM-GTX-Intel-i7-9750H-16GB-1660Ti-Core-15-dc1088wm-6GB-Included-15-6-SSD-100-Value-Mouse-256GB-Gaming/992363585">HP Omen laptop bundle from Walmart for just $999.99 ($400 off)</a>. This bundle will score you an HP Omen branded optical mouse and headset, which only serves to sweeten this already excellent deal.</p>
      <p>This 15-inch laptop sports a 1080p display with a 144Hz refresh rate to take full advantage of its beefy hardware. This particular model boasts an Intel Core i7-9750H paired with an Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti, which should deliver great performance at 1080p. This model also has 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which is rather stingy on the storage, though that could easily be expanded through an external HDD if necessary.</p>
      <p>The low-profile RGB keyboard is an awesome choice for gaming anywhere, but a pair of USB-A ports along the side of the frame of the laptop gives you the option to use your own peripherals if you want.</p>
      <p>The specs on this laptop make it perfect for gaming at lower resolutions, and can certainly keep pace with some of our picks for the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">best gaming laptops</a>. If you're jonesin' to pick up a solid gaming laptop before the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">best Black Friday deals</a> hit us later this month, this HP Omen bundle is a good option.Â </p>
