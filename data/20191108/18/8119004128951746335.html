        <b>Inclement weather under the influence of Cyclone Bulbul has left more than 1,000 tourists stranded at Saint Martin's Island in Cox's Bazar.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has halted the vessel movement on the Teknaf-Saint Martin's waterway route since Friday morning, trapping people who had gone to visit the popular tourist spot, according to Teknaf Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Mohammad Saiful Islam.</p>
      <p>“More than 1,000 tourists who went there before and after Thursday have been stranded.”</p>
      <p>The Met Office has asked the maritime ports to raise dangers signals due to the storm in the Bay of Bengal.</p>
      <p>The cyclonic storm under the influence of seasonal weather intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal, said Assistant Meteorologist Abdur Rahman of the Cox's Bazar Regional Office.</p>
      <p>It was centred between around 500 and 600 kilometres from the ports and is likely to cross Bangladesh coastline on Saturday night, said meteorologist Abdur Rahman.</p>
      <p>Maximum wind speed is likely to rise up to 140 kph in gusts and squalls during the storm, according to the Met Office.</p>
      <p>At present, four tourist vessels are operating on the Teknaf-Saint Martin's waterway route, according to the UNO.</p>
      <p>The local administration has been directed to take steps to ensure that the trapped tourists do not face any difficulties and misery, he added.</p>
      <p>“Arrangements will be made to bring back the stranded tourists if the weather improves,” said Saiful.</p>
      <p>The residential hotels and restaurants have been advised to take steps for ensuring the safety of the tourists, said Nur Ahmad, chairman of Saint Martin's Union Council.</p>
      <p>The hotel authorities have also been instructed to charge tourists half the price in room rent. Similar instructions have also been given to the hotels and restaurants, said the chairman.</p>
