      <h1>70% of Tories, 80% of Brexit Party Supporters Back a Leave Alliance</h1>
      <h2>A poll has revealed that a significant majority of both Conservative and Brexit Party voters back a Leave alliance.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:35:52+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author">Victoria Friedman</a></address>
      <p>A poll by YouGov <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/07/most-conservative-and-brexit-party-voters-support-">released</a> on Thursday revealed that 70 per cent of Conservative voters and 81 per cent of those who back Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party support the two parties agreeing on a pact for the December 12th election. Just eight and six per cent respectively are opposed.</p>
      <p>Such a pact would involve each party standing down and endorsing the other in specific seats in order to avoid splitting the Breit vote and handing constituencies to Remain-backing candidates.</p>

      <p>The poll was conducted after Mr Farage said that he would <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/01/farage-targets-leave-voting-labour-heartlands-makes-final-offer-boris-johnson-election-pact/">contest</a> every seat in Great Britain unless Prime Minister Boris Johnson dropped his withdrawal treaty with the EU, which the Brexit Party leader says “is not Brexit”.</p>
      <p>The YouGov survey found that in the event of a pact, a Brexit Party candidate running unopposed and endorsed by the Conservatives could receive 62 per cent of the votes from people would who otherwise vote Tory.</p>
      <p>In the opposite circumstances, 72 per cent of Farage voters would back an unopposed Conservative if endorsed by the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>In the case of a post-election coalition — should there be a hung parliament without one party having an overall majority — Tories were most happy with the prospect of partnering in government with the Brexit Party (69 per cent), followed by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) at 30 per cent.</p>

      <p>Campaigning in south Wales on Friday, Mr Farage <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50335842">said</a> he would try “for a few more days” to agree on a pact with Johnson’s Conservatives.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to go on trying for a few more days and make the point that in Torfaen, and other constituencies here in south Wales, the Conservatives haven’t won for a hundred years,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And they’re not going to win here on 12 December; there is no chance of them winning.</p>
      <p>“So I would make this urgent plea to Boris Johnson and others — don’t split the Brexit Party vote here in south Wales.</p>
      <p>“We are the challengers here in south Wales, and if you’re not in the field, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/06/farage-vows-hurt-labour-most-extraordinary-way/">we will beat Labour in many of these constituencies</a>.”</p>
      <p>“If that Leave alliance was put to the country it would win a very big majority,” he added.</p>

      <p>Mr Farage has offered an alliance with the Tories. Still, Number 10 brutally rebuffed him in September, with a spokesman <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/09/11/embattled-boris-slaps-down-farages-offer-of-help-not-fit-and-proper-persons/">calling</a> the veteran Leave campaigner not a “fit and proper” person to be allowed near government — although he has insisted he is not seeking a government office, and in fact is not even standing for Parliament himself.</p>
      <p>Despite the intransigence of the Tory leadership, however, Farage is <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/07/farage-talks-stand-down-candidates-tory-brexiteer-seats-report/">reportedly</a> in talks with Tory MPs to agree to individual pacts.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader has <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/07/farage-talks-stand-down-candidates-tory-brexiteer-seats-report/">warned</a> that “Boris’s ‘Great New Deal’ is 95 per cent the same as Mrs May’s ‘Bad Old Treaty,’” and has challenged Mr Johnson to an election debate.</p>
      <p>“If you really believe that this is a great new deal, or as you said in the last couple of days a fantastic deal, if you are really trying to tell the British public this gets Brexit done, let’s have a civilised head-to-head debate on what this EU treaty means and I’d be only too happy to stand with Boris to talk this through,” Mr Farage said on Friday.</p>
