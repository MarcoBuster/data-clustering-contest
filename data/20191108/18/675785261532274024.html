      <h1>Killer whales circle and chase great white sharks in incredible footage</h1>
      <h2>The clip was filmed in South Africa’s Seal Island off the coast of Mossel Bay and one person can be heard saying “that shark is scared”</h2>

      <p>Footage has captured the moment great white sharks try and desperately swim away from killer whales.</p>
      <p>The clip, filmed by Elton Polly in South Africa, shows the huge animals make a beeline for the sharks.</p>
      <p>“That shark is scared,” someone can be heard saying in the background.</p>
      <p>Dorsal fins can also be seen breaking the surface as the chase gets underway, reports the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/great-white-sharks-chased-killer-20841292">Daily Star.</a></p>
      <p>One of the sharks, a smaller dark shape under the surface of the water, is just seconds ahead of a giant killer whale which can be seen clearly when it breaks through the waves.</p>
      <p>A second killer whale circles around the outside and prevents the sharks from changing course.</p>

      <p>In the video, it almost appears as if the orcas are using teamwork to herd the sharks — but it not clear if it is merely a fun game or dinner for the predators.</p>
      <p>South Africa’s Seal Island off the coast of Mossel Bay – where the video was taken – is a favourite hunting ground of the great white shark.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OceansResearch/">Oceans Research</a>  shared the footage on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> and confirmed that killer whales were chasing the sharks in the video caption.</p>
      <p>The group wrote: “Orcas were spotted chasing a white shark, and a few other white sharks were in the vicinity at the time.</p>

      <p>“One white shark appears to be unnerved by the presence of the orcas, but another shark didn't seem too perturbed.</p>
      <p>“We'll monitor the orca and white shark activity over the next few days, to see if there are any behavioural changes.”</p>
      <p>Conservationist Richard Peirce previously told Daily Star Online that great white sharks are being hunted and killed by killer whales, also known as orcas, who feast on their livers.</p>

      <p>The first documented sighting of killer whales eating great white sharks was back in 1997 off the Farallon Islands, near San Francisco.</p>
      <p>Startled whale-watching tourists watched a pair of orcas kill a great white before consuming its liver.</p>
      <p>Two killer whales, nicknamed Port and Starboard, have since been observed to rip out shark livers with surgical precision.</p>
