      <h2>As lawsuits fly, Township claims the deck was built in secret with no inspections</h2>

      <p>The deck that collapses, injuring dozens of people and sparking lawsuits, was built illegally, according to Langley Township filings in the ongoing court cases.</p>
      <p>Almost 40 victims – from age 15 to 83 – were hurt when a deck collapsed during a wedding celebration in the 5800-block of 268th Street in Aldergrove on April 19.</p>
      <p>Since September, lawsuits have begun flying, naming the home’s builders, the owners, a company that rented the home for a wedding celebration, and the Township of Langley. So far, 21 lawsuits appear to have been filed.</p>
      <p>Now Langley Township has filed its response, saying the local government isn’t responsible because the deck was both illegal and deficient.</p>

      <p>Jatinder Kaur Grewal was one of the party-goers who has filed a lawsuit, listing an extensive list of injuries including a broken femur, multiple foot fractures, a broken tooth that required extraction, injuries to her right knee, scarring and soft tissue injuries, and PTSD, anxiety, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue, among others.</p>

      <p>Grewal’s lawsuit names the owners, including the corporation Amaroo Estate, for building a deck that didn’t comply with building codes or local bylaws, and for failing to have it inspected by an engineer or designed by a qualified architect.</p>
      <p>Grewal alleges the Township was negligent for failing to have a reasonable system of inspection or maintenance in place.</p>
      <p>None of the allegations have been tested in court.</p>
      <p>The Township’s response details some of the alleged construction issues with the deck, which the Township says was built illegally.</p>
      <p>The house where the collapse took place was built in the early 1990s and is a 12,350 square foot home with 11 bedrooms and nine bathrooms.</p>
      <p>The original architectural drawings for the home showed a single deck as part of the home, supported by four vertical columns.</p>
      <p>Sometime after the home was finished and inspected by the Township, another deck – the one that collapsed – was built. It’s unknown which owner – the home has had three sets of owners, with Amaroo buying the property in 2016 – built the new deck.</p>
      <p>“The illegal deck was constructed without any building permit from the Township,” said the Township’s legal response.</p>
      <p>No one ever applied for permits or submitted drawings of the deck, the Township claims.</p>
      <p>“Construction of the deck was thus carried out surreptitiously and entirely unbeknownst to the Township and, as a result, its construction was never subject to the Township’s inspection.”</p>
      <p>The deck’s flaws are then listed.</p>
      <p>It was apparently held up by two columns, with the deck only connected to the house’s fascia boards with nails and screws, not extending into or under the house for stability.</p>
      <p>There was a gap in the waterproofing at the edge of the deck, which allowed in water and led to rot, the response says.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Township now claims that Amaroo Estate was “in the business of providing executive-style furnished accommodations” and that this included renting the property for the April pre-wedding party.</p>
      <p>The Township says this was an illegal rental business, run without a business license.</p>
      <p>The municipality didn’t become aware of the business until after the deck collapse, says the claim.</p>
      <p>The Township denied any responsibility for Grewal’s injuries, or even that she was present on the deck at all.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time the building has drawn the attention of the Township. In 2011, a member of the public complained about illegal suites, allegedly being built by unqualified trades workers.</p>
      <p>A Township inspection found at least three residential suites as well as a main dwelling unit, with four kitchens and four laundry rooms, and all the work had been done without building permits.</p>
      <p>Warning letters and tickets were issued until the suites were removed.</p>
      <p>A single legal secondary suite was built in 2014.</p>
