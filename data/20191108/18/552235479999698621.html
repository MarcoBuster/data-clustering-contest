      <h1>Leeann Dempster defends Hibs summer recruitment and hits out at 'unnecessary criticism'</h1>
      <h2>The Hibs chief executive defended the club's transfer work in the summer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:17:01+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Hibs chief executive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Leeann Dempster</a> has hit out against claims the club's transfer policy has resulted in the sacking of Paul Heckingbottom.</p>
      <p>The Yorkshireman was sacked after a 5-2 semi-final defeat by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> at Hampden topped a poor run of Premiership form.</p>
      <p>He made an excellent start to life in Edinburgh and managed to orchestrate a revival that saw the club claim an unlikely top six finish.</p>
      <p>But his nine summer signings, many from England's lower reaches, have made little impact and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> sit a solitary point from bottom.</p>
      <p>The narrative has taken hold that the manager, undoubtedly a talented coach, underestimated our game and signed a raft of stars unable to cope with top level demands.</p>

      <p>Dempster bristles at such suggestions and has backed the players to show their worth in the season ahead.</p>
      <p>She said: "I don't think anything went wrong with it to be honest.</p>
      <p>"We have a strong group of players here. We need to make some tweaks around the edges.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"We have had good recruitment at this cub over a number of years and I think some of the players have had some unnecessary criticism so I'm going to stand behind the players.</p>
      <p>"It's important to say that we know there are some gaps, we maybe need to add a bit of depth but I don't think anything went wrong.</p>
      <p>"I know people have opinions but if you want to live your life in hindsight then we'd be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> winners at the moment so we don't do that here. We make choices and decisions at the time. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't."</p>
