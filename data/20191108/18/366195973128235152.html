      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/andersonpaak/profile">Anderson .Paak</a>â€™s most talented band, The Free Nationals, have been steadily dropping off a few singles here and there in anticipation for their upcoming self-titled tape that's set to arrive December 13th. We've already been blessed with the posthumous <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/MacMiller/profile">Mac Miller</a> assisted single "Time" as well as other releases such as "On Sight" and "Eternal Light."</p>
      <p>Today the group has come through with a new release with the likes of Syd where her smooth vocals accompany the band's production perfectly. The full album has a stacked features list with acts like J.I.D., Daniel Caesar, .Paak, Mac Miller, Kali Uchis, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ti/profile">T.I.</a>, Conway Westside, Gunn and more doing their thing throughout the 13-track offering.</p>
      <p>Stream the new-new and let us know what you think.</p>
