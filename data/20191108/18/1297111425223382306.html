      <p>Cody Fajardo remains steadfast in his intention of playing in the CFL’s West Division final on Nov. 17.</p>
      <p>“At this point, it’s the playoffs and I will be on the field for the West final no matter how painful it is,” the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ quarterback vowed Thursday after it was announced that he’s the West Division nominee for the league’s most outstanding player award.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-eyeing-the-bye-with-or-without-cody-fajardo">The Riders’ No. 1 quarterback is dealing with an oblique muscle that he injured during practice on Oct. 30</a>. The injury sidelined him for Saturday’s 23-13 win over the visiting Edmonton Eskimos. Rookie Isaac Harker stepped in for Fajardo, leading the Riders to a victory that clinched first place in the West (13-5 record) and a bye to the final.</p>
      <p>“These ones are the toughest because it’s time,” Fajardo said of the injury. “There isn’t anything you can do that helps the healing process go any quicker. It’s frustrating because you want to be hands-on and you want to do as much as you can. Sometimes, less is better. If you do too much, then you can overwork it or cause more problems.</p>
      <p>“I have been really thankful about having this week off.”</p>
      <p>The Riders are to practice on Friday — at the AffinityPlex indoor soccer facility — for the first time since Saturday’s win over the Eskimos. It’s unlikely that Fajardo will participate in the session.</p>
      <p>“Don’t panic Rider Nation,” Fajardo said. “I probably won’t be out there. If I am, then I am. Don’t panic because things are getting better.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo threw a football-shaped whiffle ball on Thursday, which he termed “positive news.” He still expects some discomfort when he throws an actual football.</p>
      <p>“There will definitely be some pain in the game and some limitations,” Fajardo said. “At the end of the day, the adrenaline will take over and I’m excited for that to happen. The best drug that you can be on is adrenaline.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo was on the field with his teammates Friday and while he took a few snaps, he wasn’t seen throwing a football.</p>

        <b>RIDERS EARN THREE WEST DIVISION AWARDS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fajardo, linebacker Cameron Judge (most outstanding Canadian) and head coach Craig Dickenson (coach of the year) are all West Division award winners and finalists for individual league honours.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old Fajardo has come a long way since signing with the Riders as a backup. He’s now nominated for one of the league’s most prestigious awards.</p>
      <p>“At the beginning of the year, if you had told me that I would be the West nominee for MOP, I would have laughed at you …,” said Fajardo, who was a backup with the Toronto Argonauts (2016-17) and B.C. Lions (2018) before signing with the Riders as a free agent during the off-season. “This year (in Saskatchewan) and where it has been in my career has meant a lot for me personally.</p>
      <p>“It’s always funny when you talk about individual awards in a team sport. Without the offensive line I have, the receivers that I have or without the defence getting the ball back, there is no quarterback or the stats that I have. It’s great when you go out there and play well, but this is more about the team than it is about me.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo led the CFL in passing yards (4,302) while completing 18 touchdown passes against eight interceptions and rushing for 10 majors. On Wednesday, he was among eight Riders named West Division all-stars.</p>
      <p>Receiver/returner Brandon Banks of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats is the East Division’s MOP nominee. Banks led the CFL in receptions (111), receiving yards (1,550), receiving touchdowns (13) and yards after the catch (657).</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-stresses-team-first-approach">Dickenson earned coach-of-the-year recognition in his first season as a head coach after guiding the Riders to first place in the West Division for the first time since 2009.</a> Orlondo Steinhauer, head coach of the 15-3 Tiger-Cats, is the East Division’s nominee.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/cameron-judge-finds-new-home-in-saskatchewan-roughriders-linebacker-corps">Judge, the second-overall selection in the 2017 CFL draft, recorded 61 defensive tackles, five sacks, a forced fumble and two interceptions.</a> He returned his second pick for a touchdown that iced the win over Edmonton. Montreal Alouettes middle linebacker Henoc Muamba, a former Rider, was nominated out of the East Division.</p>
      <p>The player awards are to be presented Nov. 21 in advance of the 107th Grey Cup game on Nov. 24 in Calgary.</p>
