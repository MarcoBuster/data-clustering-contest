      <p>That being said, Pirates received a boost in motivation ahead of their crunch tie against Kaizer Chiefs this weekend when the Bokke rocked up with the world-famous Webb Ellis Cup as well.</p>
      <p>With the likes of Happy Jele spotted having a warm embrace with Bok captain Siya Kolisi, a few of the rugby stars even showed their support for Pirates by doing the famous crossbones pose!</p>
