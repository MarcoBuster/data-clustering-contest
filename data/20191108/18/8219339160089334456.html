      <p>Want to bump up your email management efficiency on iPhone or iPad? Read along for how to quickly select, move, mark, and delete multiple emails in the Mail app with a two-finger tap and drag on iPhone and iPad.</p>
      <p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/ios-13/">iOS 13</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/ipados-13/">iPadOS 13</a> bring a myriad of changes including UI updates across the built-in iOS apps. With the latest software, accessing edit options in Mail is more difficult than in iOS 12 and earlier releases, but fortunately, there’s a handy two-finger shortcut.</p>
      <p>Below, we’ll look at how to quickly select, move, delete, and mark multiple emails on <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">iPhone and iPad</a>. And the same two-finger tap and drag <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/24/edit-messages-iphone-ipad-two-finger-tap/">works for other apps like Messages</a>, Notes, and more.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open the default Mail app and the inbox you’d like to manage</li>
        <li>Give a two-finger tap on any of your emails to enter edit mode</li>
        <li>Use a two-finger drag to select multiple messages</li>
        <li>At the bottom of your iPhone or iPad, tap <i><b>Mark</b></i><i>,</i> <b><i>Move</i></b>, or <b><i>Trash</i></b></li>
