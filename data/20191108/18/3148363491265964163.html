      <p>Jeannine Ruck and her husband, Jack, of Fort Thomas, legally <a href="https://www.wlwt.com/article/3-siblings-adopted-by-northern-kentucky-family/29729901">adopted</a> Will, 7; his brother, Eli, 6; and their sister, Anna Mae, 2, during an adoption ceremony at the Campbell County Court on Thursday morning, according to WLWT.</p>
      <p>Jeannine said that although the three-and-a-half-year process from foster to adoption was long and hard, it was worth every minute to finally have a daughter of their own.</p>
      <p>“We’ve always wanted a daughter, and now we have one — and she’s sassy just like me. Even though I didn’t have her, but she acts just like me. I’m raising her to be a strong, independent woman,” the mom said.</p>
      <p>She urged others to consider adopting children because there are lots of kids who need families.</p>
      <p>“There are so many children out there that need loving homes,” she said. “The holidays are coming up. They just need someone to love them unconditionally. Like I said, there’s so many kids that are waiting to be adopted.”</p>
      <p>The U.S. Departement of Health and Human Services Child Welfare website <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/siblingissues.pdf">stated</a> that siblings who are kept together through the foster care and adoption process experience more stability.</p>
      <p>The site read:</p>
      <blockquote>Having a brother or sister provides children with a peer partner with whom they can explore their environments, navigate social and cognitive challenges, and learn skills. Sibling relationships can provide a source of continuity throughout a child’s lifetime and can be the longest relationships that people experience.</blockquote>
      <p>“Maintaining and strengthening sibling bonds is a key component to child well-being and permanency outcomes,” the agency concluded.</p>
      <p>In October, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/local/2019/10/18/single-dad-adopts-five-siblings-at-once-to-keep-them-together/">reported</a> that a single dad in Buffalo, New York, who has fostered 30 children, recently adopted five siblings all under the age of six to keep them together.</p>
      <p>“I fought for close to two and a half years just to be able to get them together, and we won, we got it,” said 48-year-old Lamont Thomas once the adoption was made final.</p>
      <p>“I want to be the difference; make a difference by being a difference for these youths,” he concluded.</p>
      <p>Thomas’s son, Michael, whom he began fostering in 2001 and eventually adopted, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/health/2019/11/03/adopted-son-praises-dad-adopting-five-siblings-under-age-six/">praised</a> Thomas for opening his home to the young children.</p>
      <p>“It really was a shocker. I didn’t expect for him to restart and to do it all over again. It’s just amazing,” he said, adding, “I don’t believe that I would be the person that I am today without the morals that he instilled in me, the extended family that I have now.”</p>
