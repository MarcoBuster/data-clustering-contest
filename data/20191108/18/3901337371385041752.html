      <p>Eniola Aluko, a women's footballer who currently plays for Italian giants Juventus, seemingly feels there is too much hype over what Guardiola has achieved in his career so far.</p>
      <p>The former England international has now suggested that the Spaniard needs to win Europe's biggest club competition without the help of Messi to be considered among the best, pointing out that Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp has won it with Divock Origi.</p>

      <p>"Guardiola has never got to a European final without Lionel Messi, whereas Klopp has won one with Divock Origi," she wrote in a column for <i>The Guardian</i>.</p>
      <p>"Guardiola's Barcelona side won the treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League in 2008/09, something no other manager had done, but Luis Enrique repeated the feat in 2014/15 and nobody has him down as one of the all-time greats.</p>
      <p>"Jose Mourinho won the Champions League with Porto and Inter Milan, and eight league titles in four countries, yet he seems to be disregarded as an oldâ€‘school manager with outdated ideas."</p>

      <p>Guardiola and Klopp were recently involved in what can somewhat be seen as a war of words ahead of their Premier League encounter on Sunday, one that both teams will be desperate to win.</p>
