      <p>Wisconsin couple Brandon Tidd, 34, and wife Elizabeth, 23, met Shannon, 30, from Ohio, through their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harry-potter">Harry Potter</a> role play website.</p>
      <p>The trio initially became friends and Shannon moved in with the couple after she moved out of her parents home to look for her place.</p>

      <p>Brandon, who met his wife in 2014 through the military, also began falling for Shannon, and the trio decided to start a polyamorous relationship.</p>
      <p>Last year, Brandon and Elizabeth 'proposed' to Shannon in a latter about their feelings for her and took her to a paper lantern festival.</p>
      <p>They were 'married' in October, and by March, Elizabeth fell pregnant to her husband.</p>
      <p>The trio are planning to raise the baby due in December together.</p>
      <p>They explained how they met over their Harry Potter role play website, where writers are able to create new characters and stories together.</p>

      <p>Brandon explained how his character had started to fall in love with another character, so he messaged the writer - Shannon.</p>
      <p>As the friendship grew, he and his wife began chatting about Shannon regularly and Elizabeth began messaging her too.</p>
      <p>They decided to help her get on her feet and move out of her parents' home.</p>
      <p>The couple travelled from Wisconsin to meet Elizabeth in Ohio and they all got along so well she immediately decided to move in with them.</p>
      <p>Brandon sad: 'One day, after a little bit to drink; a game of Truth or Dare turned interestingly fun and it had them kissing. Elizabeth was raised extremely Lutheran, so she had never done that before with a girl and was surprised she enjoyed it.</p>

      <p>"The next day, it happened again, but it went much further. That was the beginning of Elizabeth falling for Shannon and it grew from there. Friendship combining attraction."</p>
      <p>Brendan said while there was some jealousy at the beginning, they have built trust and all love one another.</p>
      <p>He said they overcame jealousy by communicating, and maintaining equality- even using each other as "referees" to maintain order if two of the trio are engaged in a fight.</p>
      <p>Brandon claimed including Shannon in the relationship had strengthened his relationship with Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>"This life means that we communicate more than a normal couple. If one of us is off, we have two people to lean on. If two of us are fighting, we always have a referee. We remain equal and we all have a say," he said.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"We make sure jealousy is not allowed in and if there is an issue we stop and do a throuple 'check in'. Usually led by me unless I am really upset.</p>
      <p>"We would ask each person how they are doing on a scale of one to ten, what is upsetting them, what is making them happy and we say three positive things about each person.</p>
      <p>"We just happen to all be people that fell in love with two people instead of just one. None of us were looking to be in a 'throuple' it kind of just developed that way naturally like with any couple.</p>

      <p>"I would say overall, including Shannon in our relationship has strengthened it; it takes a lot of trust between the two of us to fully love each other and fully love another person and like any couple the three of us have our arguments but I feel very strong in the relationship.</p>
      <p>"It's funny because people think living with two girls must be harder because of all the emotions, but with the way our dynamic works, all the of us haven't fought about anything.</p>
      <p>He said the 'throuple' are looking forward to moving to Oregon with their dogs, and welcoming their baby girl shortly before the new year.</p>
      <p>He said she will be raised with "two mummies and a daddy."</p>
