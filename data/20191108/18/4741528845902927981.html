      <p>As the <b>Nigerian Senate</b> prepares to begin legislative processes on the bill to amend various tax laws in the country, President Muhammadu Buhari has proposed sweeping changes to Nigeria’s tax system.</p>
      <p><b>In a bid to drive revenue</b>, President Buhari presented the <a href="https://pwcnigeria.typepad.com/tax_matters_nigeria/2019/11/2019-finance-bill-sweeping-changes-to-nigerias-tax-laws-underway-.html?utm_campaign=5a78693e94a32673ae004919&amp;utm_content=5dc43b0efef30000019d004c&amp;utm_medium=smarpshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">2019 Finance Bill,</a> which seeks to introduce major changes in major tax laws, to the Legislature along with the 2019 Budget.</p>
      <p><b>As earlier reported on <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/10/08/buharis-budget-speech/">Nairametrics</a></b>, the Finance Bill has five strategic objectives, in terms of achieving incremental but necessary changes to our fiscal laws. These objectives are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>promoting fiscal equity by mitigating instances of regressive taxation;</li>
        <li>reforming domestic tax laws to align with global best practices;</li>
        <li>introducing tax incentives for investments in infrastructure and capital markets; and</li>
        <li>supporting Micro, Small and Medium-sized businesses in line with our Ease of Doing Business Reforms.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>While presenting the budget earlier</b>, President Buhari disclosed that the Finance Bill proposes an increase in the VAT rate from 5% to 7.5%. As such, the 2020 Appropriation Bill is based on this new VAT rate. The President also noted that the additional revenues would be used to fund health, education and infrastructure programmes.<i> “As the States and Local Governments are allocated 85% of all VAT revenues, we expect to see greater quality and efficiency in their spending in these areas as well.”</i></p>

        <li>Commencement and cessation rules modified to eliminate overlaps and gaps to avoid double taxation and complication during commencement.</li>
