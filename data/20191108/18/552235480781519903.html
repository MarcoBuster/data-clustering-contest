      <p>A spokesperson from IRN-BRU <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/funfair-organisers-could-consult-dumbarton-18804120">Carnival</a> said: "During these sessions, the main hall lights will be on, music will be turned off or very low and the rides will be slower where possible, although the ride lights will still be on.</p>
      <p>"For the first hour of each session, there will be no access for the general public, meaning that visitors with autism and sensory processing disorders will have time to enjoy the rides with no queues or crowds and to get used to their environment.</p>
      <p>"After the first hour, the Carnival will open to the general public, but the other measures, reduced music and lights, will remain in place for a further two hours.</p>
      <p>"After this time, gradually, the main hall lights will be dimmed, and the volume of music will increase, and rides will return to their regular speed.</p>
      <p>"During the autism sessions there will also be quiet areas available, and sensory packs for guests.</p>
      <p>"We hope that these measures help as many people as possible to enjoy the IRN-BRU Carnival."</p>
