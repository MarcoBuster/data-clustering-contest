      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that the government would not engage in any politics over the health or medical treatment of former premier Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>The prime minister said that the name of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief was included in the Exit Control List (ECL) on the recommendation of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB’s) and would be removed only on its request.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan made these remarks while chairing a meeting of government spokespersons which reviewed the political and economic situation of the country.</p>
      <p>Commenting on Nawaz’s possible medical treatment abroad, the premier said that he had been saying since day one to keep politics away from human health.</p>
      <p>“We will not engage in any politics on Nawaz’s health or his medical treatment. We believe in the autonomy of state institutions,” he remarked.</p>
      <p>Commenting on Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F’s) protest in Islamabad, the premier termed the demand of his resignation unconstitutional and called for serious negotiations with the opposition.</p>
      <p>He said that the negotiation committee of the government was dealing with all the affairs of ‘Azadi march’ and trying to resolve the issue with mutual understanding.</p>
      <p>“The government spokespersons should desist from making harsh statements during negotiations,” the prime minister said, adding that “the country’s economy was seeing stability and the government was heading towards implementing its manifesto.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, the prime minister held separate meetings with government’s negotiating committee led by Defence Minister Pervez Khattak and Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi.</p>
      <p>Federal Interior Minister Ejaz Shah and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Babar Awan were also in attendance in the negotiating committee meeting. The interior minister briefed the prime minister about the government’s strategy and arrangements for ‘Azadi march’.</p>
      <p>The committee told the premier that protest was a constitutional right of the opposition and posed no risk to the government. It further said that the demonstrators would not have been allowed in Islamabad if there was any threat.</p>
      <p>According to sources, PM’s negotiating committee had been directed to continue deliberations with the opposition.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Chaudhry Pervez Elahi briefed the prime minister about his meetings with Maulana Fazlur Rehman and the demands and recommendations that were put forward.</p>
