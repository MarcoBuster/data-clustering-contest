      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A Madison woman suffered a broken bone and spinal injury when an impaired driver struck her head-on on Madison's east side Thursday afternoon, police said. </p>
      <p>Madison police said 34-year-old Kenneth A. Lutomski, of Cudahy, was driving a large white rental truck on Williamson Street at about 1:30 p.m. </p>
      <p>Witnesses told police the rental truck was over the road, driving recklessly and slowing down for no reason as it went from John Nolen Drive onto Williamson Street.</p>
      <p>A 53-year-old woman was driving a compact car in the 1000 block of Williamson Street when she saw Lutomski's truck coming at her head-on. Police said Lutomski swerved from his lane of traffic into the oncoming lane and the vehicles collided. </p>
      <p>At the hospital, the woman told police, "There was nowhere to go ... he came straight at me." She suffered a broken ankle and a spinal fracture, police said. </p>
      <p>According to the report, a 27-year-old Madison woman told police that before the head-on crash, the truck swerved at her car, sideswiping it and causing damage. Other drivers reported near misses.</p>
      <p>Police said the truck's driver appeared drowsy with pinpoint pupils and droopy eyelids. He admitted to being a heroin user, but denied using the drug Thursday. Following field sobriety tests, he was arrested on suspicion of causing injury by intoxicated use of a vehicle and was cited on suspicion of deviating from the designated lane.</p>
