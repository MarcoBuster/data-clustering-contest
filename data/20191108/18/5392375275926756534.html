      <p>Huawei Mate X Cannot Be Bent at -5° C and Below This Temperature<br/>3.6 (72.63%) 38 votes</p>
      <p>Huawei’s first smartphone with a folding screen will hit the market as soon as on November 15. Huawei Mate X 5G costs 16,999 yuan ($2430). Agree, it’s overpriced. And though at the moment, there are only two-three handsets with such a form factor, the Huawei’s model is the most expensive. Not only that, this handset also brings some inconveniences during the use. Honestly, many think such a smartphone has no future. But at the moment, we have what we have.</p>

      <p>According to Huawei Mate X official website introduction page, the phone can’t be bent at -5 ° C and below this temperature. In other words, this folding screen smartphone is more fragile than you think.</p>

      <p>In addition, the official also reminded that the Huawei Mate X contains precision components. To extend the service life, the company is asking to avoid foreign matter such as liquid and dust entering the inside of the phone (including hinges). ‘During the use, please avoid the phone being hit or dropped to the ground to avoid sharp objects. From the factory, it comes with a specially-designed protective film. Please, do not remove or add a protective film. If you need to replace it, please, contact the customer service hotline to make an appointment. Please, do not replace it yourself. Also, do not use a third-party protective film.’</p>
      <p>It’s been quite interesting what it reveals says for such cases. Unfortunately, we didn’t find anything similar to this on Samsung’s official website. Either this means there is no similar issue with the Galaxy Fold or the company doesn’t want to talk about it.</p>
