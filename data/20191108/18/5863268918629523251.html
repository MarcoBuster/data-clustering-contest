      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – The party lawyers have decided to file a miscellaneous application in the Lahore High Court (LHC) to retrieve the passport of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz.</p>
      <p>After the decision to remove Maryam Nawaz’s from the Exit Control List (ECL), the lawyers are trying to regain her passport from the Lahore High Court. </p>
      <p>Maryam Nawaz submitted her passport on the court’s order after she was granted bail in the Chaudhry Sugar Mills case. Lawyers will use the legal procedure to withdraw her passport from the court.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Maryam Nawaz also said during the accountability court hearing that Nawaz Sharif s condition was invalid and he needed to go abroad for treatment and at that time he was most needed. In case of returning the passport, Maryam can travel to the country with her father.</p>
      <p>Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz has on Friday said that her father, erstwhile premier and party supremo, Nawaz Sharif must go anywhere around the world where his treatment is possible.</p>
      <p>Maryam Nawaz talked to media outside an accountability court (AC) in Lahore and maintained that it is another debate whether Nawaz Sharif is willing for treatment abroad.</p>
      <p>She told that the PML-N supreme leader’s health is still very critical as his platelets count is not getting stable despite medication. Nawaz Sharif’s platelets dropped yesterday as well and doctors are not able to identify his disease, Maryam said.</p>
      <p>The PML-N vice president added that politics will continue but we get our parents only once, and it was very tough to appear before the court today owing to Nawaz Sharif’s serious health.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the accountability court extended the judicial remand of Maryam Nawaz and her cousin, Yousaf Abbas, till November 22 in Chaudhry Sugar Mills case as AC Judge Amir Mohammad Khan conducted the hearing.</p>
      <p>The court inquired about Maryam Nawaz’s surety bonds from her counsel. Advocate Amjad Pervez told that the bonds have been submitted and the original copy is presented in the court.</p>
      <p>The AC asked the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor regarding Chaudhry Sugar Mills case reference and the official lawyer told that it will soon be filed. The court inquired from Maryam Nawaz about her appearance following the bail, to which she assured to act in accordance with the court’s command.</p>
      <p>Judge Amir Mohammad Khan gave exemption to both Maryam Nawaz and Nawaz Sharif from appearing before the court till the reference is filed. The hearing was adjourned till November 22. </p>
