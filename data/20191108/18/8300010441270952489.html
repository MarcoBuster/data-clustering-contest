      <p>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (KABC) -- Hundreds showed up Thursday night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, where one year ago, a gunman walked in, opened fire and left 12 people dead.<br/><br/>Savannah Horvath drove in from Las Vegas to be here.<br/><br/>"There was no way I could miss this. This is my home. And I lost three friends, and there's no way that I couldn't be in the presence of my angels tonight," Horvath said.<br/><br/>Those angels saw an amazing sight: a massive, spontaneous line dance broke out under the Borderline oak tree.<br/><br/>Hundreds of dancers were in the spot where thousands of flowers and candles were placed in the days after the shooting last year. <br/><br/><i>To see more stories about the rebirth and healing in the community, <a href="https://abc7.com/rebirth-healing-continues-1-year-after-borderline-shooting-woolsey-fire/5663120/">click here</a>.</i></p>
