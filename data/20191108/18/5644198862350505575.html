      <p>MELBOURNE: A pigeon has been pinching poppies from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Australia's national war memorial in Canberra and using them to build a colorful nest in the lead-up to Remembrance Day commemorations.</p>
      <p>The pigeon has created the nest with the red flowers under the soft light of a stained glass window at The Australian War Memorial, the West Australian newspaper reported.</p>

      <p>The poppy is a symbol used by Commonwealth countries to recognise the sacrifice made by armed forces members who have died in the line of duty.</p>
      <p>"The wounded soldier symbolises the defining quality of endurance, and the nest of poppies nearby is a poignant reminder of the powerful bond between man and beast on the battlefield," a War Memorial spokesperson told the West Australian.</p>
      <p>Remembrance Day is commemorated on NovÂ 11 each year.</p>
