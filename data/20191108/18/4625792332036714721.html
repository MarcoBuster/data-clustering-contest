      <h1>GOP's Jim Jordan moved to intelligence panel for public impeachment hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:13:12+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author">Susan Ferrechio</a></address>
      <p>The GOP’s top lawmaker on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-republicans-may-shuffle-intelligence-panel-roster-ahead-of-impeachment-hearings">temporarily take a spot on the intelligence panel</a> while it holds public impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>Republican leaders decided Friday to move Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio to the House Intelligence Committee, where he will serve a key role cross-examining witnesses selected by Democrats, who control the majority. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas is temporarily stepping aside to make room for Jordan on the intelligence panel.</p>
      <p>"Jim Jordan has been on the front lines in the fight for fairness and truth," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said in a statement. "His addition will ensure more accountability and transparency in this sham process.”</p>

      <p>Jordan has defended President Trump against charges he misused his office to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Jordan has also been critical of the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/gop-lawmakers-storm-closed-impeachment-proceeding-and-demand-access">closed-door impeachment proceedings</a> and limitations on GOP participation in the process.</p>
      <p>Democrats have scheduled hearings to begin on Wednesday with the testimony of acting Ukraine Ambassador William Taylor, who told lawmakers in a closed-door deposition that he believed Trump was holding back security aid in an effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.</p>
