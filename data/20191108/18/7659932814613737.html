      <p>Fresh clashes between Iraqi security forces and anti-government protesters broke out in Baghdad on Friday despite a call for calm by the country's top Shiite cleric, Ali al-Sistani.<br/><br/>Security forces fired tear gas and threw stun grenades into crowds of protesters wearing helmets and makeshift body armor on a main road in the middle of the Iraqi capital, sending demonstrators scattering, some wounded, Reuters reporters said.<br/><br/>Sistani held security forces accountable for any violent escalation and urged the government to respond as quickly as possible to demonstrators' demands.<br/><br/>"The biggest responsibility is on the security forces," a representative of Sistani said in a sermon after Friday prayers in Kerbala. "They must avoid using excessive force with peaceful protesters."<br/><br/>The demonstrators, mostly unemployed youths, demand an overhaul of the political system and a corrupt ruling class.<br/><br/>More than 260 people have been killed since the protests began in Baghdad on Oct. 1 and quickly spread to southern provinces, according to police and medics.<br/><br/>Police, the military and paramilitary groups have used live gunfire against mostly unarmed protesters since the beginning of the unrest.<br/><br/>The violent response from authorities has fueled public anger. Snipers from Iran-backed militias that have participated in the crackdown were deployed last month, Reuters reported.<br/><br/>Live fire is still being used and even tear gas canisters, fired directly at protesters' bodies instead of being lobbed into crowds, have killed at least 16 people, New York-based Human Rights Watch said on Friday.<br/><br/>Doctors at hospitals have shown Reuters scans of tear gas canisters embedded in the skulls of dead protesters.<br/><br/>Sistani warned against the exploitation of the unrest by "internal and external" forces which he said sought to destabilize Iraq for their own goals.<br/><br/>He said those in power must come up with a meaningful response to the demonstrations.</p>
