      <h1>Former Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera hits outs at club owners after PSG switch</h1>
      <h2>‘There were times when I felt that football was not considered the most important thing’</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ander-herrera">Ander Herrera</a> has claimed that football was “not considered the most important thing” at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited">Manchester United</a> during his time at the club.</p>
      <p>Herrera called time on a five-year stay at Old Trafford this summer and joined Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer when his United contract expired.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard accused United of moving too late on a new deal, which led him to believe that he would not play an important part in the club’s future if he stayed.</p>
      <p>In an interview with French football magazine So Foot, Herrera has said that he was also unconvinced that the club’s culture was fully focused on football.</p>
      <p>“I was happy at that incredible club,” the 30-year-old said. “I am very grateful to the supporters.</p>
      <p>“Frankly, I was immensely happy in Manchester, but at the club, there were times when I felt that football was not considered the most important thing.”</p>
      <p>Herrera refused to clarify what he felt “the most important thing” was at United. “I do not want to compare, all I know is that here [at PSG], I feel like I’m breathing football on all sides. And I like it.</p>
      <p>“I cannot talk about what was happening in previous seasons because I was not there, but since I’m here, what I see is that I’m in a club that think only and exclusively about football.”</p>
      <p>Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, told investors in a September conference call that the club is and always has been fully committed to achieving success on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“We remain focused on our plan of rebuilding the team and continuing to strengthen our youth system, in line with the philosophy of the club and the manager,” Woodward said.</p>
      <p>“Everyone at Manchester United is committed to delivering on our primary objective of winning trophies.”</p>
