      <h2>The Italian striker was racially abused during Brescia's clash with Verona on Sunday but his current club have criticised him and defended their opponents' fan base</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:38:09+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mario-balotelli">Mario Balotelli</a> has been branded arrogant by his own Brescia ultras for standing up to racist abuse.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> striker <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/mario-balotelli-boots-ball-crowd-20802483">kicked the ball into the stand</a> against Hellas Verona in protest against monkey noises from the crowd.</p>
      <p>Verona's Poltrone Est stand will be closed for one game as punishment while the head of the Verona ultras has been banned for claiming Balotelli was “never completely Italian”.</p>
      <p>But now Brescia fans have criticised the Italy striker for not ignoring the opposition fans in a crunch Serie A fixture – and defended Verona.</p>
      <p>“If Balotelli was not ready psychologically to face the Verona fanbase, then he should’ve said so and left his place to someone less,” said a statement from Brescia ultras.</p>

      <p>“None of us would’ve been upset if he had, quite the contrary.</p>
      <p>“We have absolutely no doubts that Balotelli is to all intents Italian, and even a Bresciano, but the arrogance that he continually gives off is unjustifiable.”</p>
      <p>Balotelli attempted to storm off the pitch during the class last Sunday, before the game was halted by the referee as part of the anti-racism protocol, while teammates tried to calm the striker down.</p>
      <p>He continued to play when the game eventually resumed, and scored, before leaving the pitch at full-time visibly upset and covering his face.</p>

      <p>After the game, Verona boss Ivan Juric claimed not to have heard any abuse.</p>
      <p>“You can ask him [Balotelli], there was nothing there. I am disgusted by racist abuse and I will be the first to condemn it when it happens, but this was not it," he said.</p>
      <p>“They provoked him with jeers and sarcastic chants, but they were not racist. Anything else is a lie."</p>
      <p>Brescia's ultras added in their post that Balotelli's attitude is the main problem, citing his middle finger salute to the Inter Milan fans last month.</p>
      <p>They also claimed a number of fans had turned their backs on the striker not because of his race, but for his 'childlike and unsavoury attitude'.</p>
      <p>Balotelli could next be in action for Bresica on Saturday in the home clash with Torino.</p>
