      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | The Colombian is in a rich vein of form for Rangers and could be in-demand when the window re-opens in 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:45:31+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers fans have given their verdict after <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> boss Dean Smith name checked Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p>The Gers striker has been extensively linked with a switch to B6, with Smith in the market for more goal scoring reinforcements.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is in blistering form for Steven Gerrard's side and added to his collection with a strike from distance in their Europa League win over Porto.</p>

      <p>The Villa boss was asked about a move for Morelos and refused to be drawn on the speculation: "I certainly saw his goal last night," he siad.</p>
      <p>"It was a very good finish.</p>
      <p>"He's a player who is contracted to another football club and we aren't a club that talks about them."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Although he remained coy on links with Morelos he did all but confirm they would look to sign a striker in the January window.</p>
      <p>"Possibly, simply because Keinan Davis has a hamstring injury at the moment so he's one who is out," Smith added.</p>
      <p>"We've got young Wesley who is playing his first Premier League campaign, like a few others are, so we will just have to wait and see until January."</p>
      <p>Here's how Rangers fans on social media reacted to Smith's non-committal response to the Morelos links:</p>

      <p><b>@thelionbrand:</b> 35 million or don’t even make the call English market prices means that’s not even a big number really!!!</p>
      <p><b>@MiamiTam1872:</b> He will be worth the same amount in summer maybe more, you're giving me the fear. Please stop</p>
      <p><b>@RT_415:</b> Should be holding out for higher than villa. Although money talks I suppose.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@NorseSon:</b> I think Alfredo will be aiming a bit higher than Villa when he moves on.</p>
      <p><b>@j1mbow:</b> Morelos, when he moves, deserves a bigger club than Aston Villla.</p>
      <p><b>@StyoorT:</b> He’ll go to the highest bidder who offers him the most. Outside the top 6 it could be anyone tbh.</p>
      <p><b>@19thompson64:</b> it would be easier to count the people who didn't see his goal last night.</p>
