      <h2>Fellow Strictly Come Dancing professional Gorka Marquez described the dance as one of the most moving routines they had ever danced</h2>

      <p>Anton Du Beke was in tears over this year's emotional <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> Remembrance Day tribute.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the professionals will take part in a group number inspired by World War II heroes and their families.</p>
      <p>This year, the dance will take place at a train station, with loved ones saying goodbye to one another - not knowing whether they will see one another again.</p>
      <p>Anton, in particular, found the scenes tough to perform as he thought about his own children.</p>
      <p>The professional, 53, became a dad for the first time in March 2017 as he and wife Hannah Summers welcomed twins George and Henrietta.</p>

      <p>Speaking at rehearsals, Anton said: "I'm playing a father. It's a bit emotional because I can't imagine leaving my children and not coming back."</p>
      <p>Anton's eyes were red and seemed to have been crying as he spoke about his character.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Dianne Buswell said: "Characterisation is as important as the steps this week as we really wanted to make the audience feel special."</p>
      <p>"When a loved one has to leave it's really devastating for the one at home," Karen Hauer said.</p>

      <p>Gorka Marquez added: "For me, it's one of the most touching numbers we're doing on the series."</p>
      <p>Every year, Strictly marks the date with an emotional pro dance and last year's beautiful routine was highly praised by viewers.</p>
      <p>Last year, the poignant dance focused on the wives waiting at home as their husbands fought in the war.</p>
