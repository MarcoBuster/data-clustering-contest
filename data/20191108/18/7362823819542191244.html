      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/buyer-saves-1000-mph-car-project-from-bankruptcy">Bloodhound LSR</a> was driven by land speed record holder Andy Green, who piloted the ThrustSSC to 763.035 mph in 1997 to become the first person to break the sound barrier in a car.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/buyer-saves-1000-mph-car-project-from-bankruptcy">Bloodhound LSR</a> only used its Rolls-Royce jet engine during the test, which was meant to collect data to help further develop its aerodynamics and safety systems.</p>

      <p>The British team is next aiming for 550 mph, but has been delayed by a faulty sensor that keeps setting off a fire alarm. It hopes to have the issue fixed and the car ready to go again in a few days.</p>

      <p>If all goes well this season, the team could return as soon as next year to try to break Green’s record before going for the 1,000 mph mark.</p>
      <p>It’s an amazing progression for the 11-year-old effort, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/buyer-saves-1000-mph-car-project-from-bankruptcy">which went bankrupt last year before being purchased and funded by auto parts entrepreneur Ian Wathurst</a>.</p>
