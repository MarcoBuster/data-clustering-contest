      <p>(Reuters) - Austria’s overnight leader Matthias Schwab shot a five-under par 67 to maintain a one-stroke lead over four other golfers at the halfway stage at the Turkish Airlines Open in Antalya on Friday.</p>
      <p>Schwab sank an eagle on the par-five first hole and had four birdies on the back nine, offset by a bogey on the fifth, to go 12-under overall on a relatively low-scoring day at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal golf course.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t really hitting them great at all, especially early on but kept it together,” said Schwab, who is yet to win his first European Tour title.</p>
      <p>“The long game wasn’t on but I managed to make a few good pars. On the back nine I found my swing a little bit and made a few good birdies coming home.”</p>
      <p>Sweden’s Alex Noren, Belgium’s Thomas Detry and England’s Ross Fisher and Danny Willett were in a four-way tie for second at 11-under overall.</p>
      <p>England’s Tom Lewis, who shared the overnight lead with Schwab, slipped to 11th after signing for a two-under par 70.</p>
      <p>Defending champion Justin Rose of England, who is looking to accomplish the three-peat after winning the event in 2017 and 2018, was tied for sixth with four others — two strokes behind Schwab.</p>
      <p>“I put myself in position. The dream is alive, no doubt,” Rose said. “Last year I was in way worse shape after two rounds and just got it going on the weekend. If I can build from here, obviously that would be a great place to be.”</p>
