      <h1>The PNY Elite-X 64GB microSD card is on sale for $13 (57% off) on Amazon, 32GB for $9</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:56:12+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/hagop-kavafian/" target="_blank">Hagop Kavafian</a></address>
      <p>Most current phones come with a decent amount of onboard storage. However, media files and apps are also increasingly heavier, meaning you can quickly run out of space on your device. Thankfully, a wide range of handsets and tablets have a microSD slot to accommodate for extra storage. If you're looking for one, you're in luck, as PNY's 32GB and 64GB microSDXC cards are discounted on Amazon, selling for $9 and $13, respectively.</p>

      <p>These products are built to withstand harsh conditions, as they are water-, shock-, and X-ray proof. They're also designed with velocity in mind, as they can achieve reads speeds as high as 90MB/s, and feature Class 10 and U3 ratings, which offers great performance when shooting photos in burst mode or recording 4K and full HD videos.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in getting one, use the links below to purchase yours on Amazon. I'd recommend going for the 64GB version, as it's only $4 more expensive and is double the size of the cheapest version.</p>
      <p><b>Buy: <br/></b>Amazon (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PNY-Elite-X-64GB-microSDXC-Adapter/dp/B01G26R13Y?tag=androidpolice-20">32GB</a>), <br/>(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PNY-Elite-X-64GB-microSDXC-Adapter/dp/B01G26R652?tag=androidpolice-20">64GB</a>)</p>
