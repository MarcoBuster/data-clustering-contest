      <p>The fight started over the allocation of duties after the house elected their new captain since Aarti Singh’s tenure had come to an end. Himanshi Khurana and Shefali Jariwala were tied with the same number of votes. The last week’s captain Aarti was then asked to select the new captain between the two.</p>
      <p>Siddharth took objection to Rashami bringing his family into the verbal fight. When Rashami’s friend Arhaan Khan came to her defence, Siddharth decided to have a go at him too. He did not even spare Paras Chhabra after the latter was seen siding with Rashami.</p>
      <p>The show also saw a brief argument between Siddharth and Tehseen Poonawalla. Siddharth was later seen poking fun at Tehseen questioning his ability to become a successful politician with such an attitude. He was seen questioning his ability secure a single vote with such an attitude.</p>

      <p>Early on in the show, Hindustani Bhau lectured Shehnaaz Gill about her selfish approach in the competition and how she had used Siddharth Shukla despite the latter always being on her side. Hindustani Bhau warned her to not take her fame for granted adding that today ‘you may be famous, but you can in a dustbin tomorrow.’</p>
      <p>According to Bhau, Shehnaaz Gill had acted in a selfish manner by deserting Siddharth even though the latter stood firmly behind her when the chips were down with the contestant from Punjab.</p>
      <p>Salman Khan will be seen admonishing Shehnaaz on Saturday saying that he was disappointed with her.</p>
