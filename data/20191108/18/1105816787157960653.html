      <h1>UN experts call Morsi's death in Egypt 'arbitrary killing'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:10:06+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>GENEVA: </b>An independent panel of United Nations experts said on Friday the death of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi in June could amount to “a state-sanctioned arbitrary killing”.</p>
      <p>“Morsi was held in conditions that can only be described as brutal, particularly during his five-year detention in the Tora prison complex,” a statement said.</p>
      <p>His death “after enduring those conditions could amount to a state-sanctioned arbitrary killing”, the experts added.</p>
      <p>Egypt’s first democratically elected civilian president Morsi died in June after collapsing in a Cairo courtroom while on trial.</p>
      <p>President Abdel Fattah-al Sisi led the military ouster of the leader in 2013 when he was head of the army.</p>
      <p>Morsi, who belonged to the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was overthrown after a tumultuous year in power.</p>
      <p>He spent nearly six years in solitary confinement where the panel said he “was denied life-saving and ongoing care for his diabetes and high blood pressure”.</p>
      <p>The experts noted on Friday that “authorities were warned repeatedly” about his deteriorating health to the “point of killing him”.</p>
      <p>“There is no evidence they (authorities) acted to address these concerns, even though the consequences were foreseeable,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>Led by special rapporteur Agnes Callamard and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, they explicitly called out Sisi’s government for human rights violations in jails describing them as “intentional”.</p>
      <p>Since ascending to the presidency in 2014, Sisi’s government has waged a wide-scale crackdown jailing thousands of activists, bloggers and even comedians.</p>
      <p>The independent panel of UN experts also warned that thousands of prisoners are faced with severe health risks due to medical negligence in jail.</p>
      <p>They listed documented reports of overcrowding, inadequate food, poor ventilation, no access to sunlight, denial of family visits as well as failure to receive medical care.</p>
      <p>Calling Morsi’s death “unlawful”, the panel recommended publishing an impartial investigation of all prisoners who have died in state custody since 2012.</p>
      <p>Amr Darrag, former international cooperation minister under Morsi and a senior Brotherhood official, welcomed the experts’ findings.</p>
      <p>“This investigation is a significant step forward in holding such regimes accountable for their actions,” he said.</p>
