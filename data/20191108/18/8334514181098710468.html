      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three major U.S. stock indexes posted record closing highs and the S&amp;P 500 registered a fifth straight week of gains on Friday as investors brushed aside worries over the progress of U.S.-China trade talks and as Walt Disney shares rose.</p>

      <p>Doubts about trade progress resurfaced earlier in the day when President Donald Trump, in remarks to reporters at the White House, said he has not agreed to a rollback of U.S. tariffs sought by China.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, officials from both countries said that the United States and China had agreed to such a deal.</p>
      <p>Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, said that while the market was initially volatile because of Trump’s remarks, it climbed right back.</p>
      <p>“The feeling now is that before the end of the year we’re going to see some type of deal,” Ghriskey said, even if it is a partial one.</p>
      <p>The Cboe volatility index .VIX posted its lowest closing level since July 24.</p>
      <p>Helping to boost the S&amp;P 500, Walt Disney Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/DIS.N">DIS.N</a>) gained 3.8% a day after it reported quarterly results that showed it spent less than it had projected on its online streaming service, Disney+. Disney’s popular theme parks and a remake of “The Lion King” lifted earnings.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.DJI">.DJI</a> rose 6.44 points, or 0.02%, to 27,681.24, the S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.SPX">.SPX</a> gained 7.9 points, or 0.26%, to 3,093.08 and the Nasdaq Composite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.IXIC">.IXIC</a> added 40.80 points, or 0.48%, to 8,475.31.</p>
      <p>For the week, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.8%, posting a fifth straight week of gains, while the Nasdaq gained 1.1%, closing out its sixth straight week of gains. The Dow was up 1.2% for the week.</p>
      <p>Increasing optimism on the trade front and mostly better-than-expected earnings have driven the recent record run in stocks. Of the 446 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far, roughly three-quarters have beaten profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The numbers, to some extent, reflect significantly lowered analysts’ forecasts.</p>
      <p>Technology shares also supported the market, including Microsoft (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O">MSFT.O</a>), which rose 1.2%.</p>
      <p>Among decliners on Friday, shares of Gap Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GPS.N">GPS.N</a>) fell 7.6% after the apparel retailer said Chief Executive Officer Art Peck would leave the company, a surprise exit in the middle of a restructuring. Gap also slashed its full-year earnings forecast.</p>

      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.07-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 87 new lows.</p>
      <p>Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.59 billion shares, compared with the 6.79 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.</p>
