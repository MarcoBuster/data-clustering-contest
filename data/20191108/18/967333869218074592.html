        <b>The details of the phone call are not known other than reports that Argentina's president-elect, Alberto Fernandez, told Jeremy Corbyn that the upcoming administration would "always claim" sovereignty over the Falkland islands.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Latin American news agencies are reporting that the newly elected Argentine president spoke to UK's main opposition leader about Latin American country's claim to the Falkland islands, currently occupied by UK residents.</p>
      <p>“If Labour wins and Mr. Corbyn becomes the next British prime minister, he can be sure I will call him to claim the Malvinas because they are an integral part of Argentina”, Fernandez <a href="https://en.mercopress.com/2019/11/07/alberto-fernandez-and-jeremy-corbyn-talked-about-the-falklands-malvinas-claim?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=rss">reportedly told</a> journalists who recently accompanied him to Mexico.</p>
      <p>According to The Merco Press South Atlantic News Agency, president-elect Fernandez <a href="https://en.mercopress.com/2019/11/07/alberto-fernandez-and-jeremy-corbyn-talked-about-the-falklands-malvinas-claim?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=rss">also told</a> reporters:</p>
      <blockquote>“The Malvinas Islands are part of Latin-America, it is a territory which was taken from us. It's true that many years ago we lost a war, but that does not end Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas”</blockquote>
      <p>The Falkland islands, known as the Malvnas to the Argentines, were claimed by Argentina in the early 1800s but were <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Falkland-Islands-War">annexed by the British empire</a> in 1833. The UK and Argentina <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/opinion/2012-06-13/analysis-the-falklands-syndrome-the-30-year-legacy-of-iron-britannia">fought a war over the islands</a> in 1982, which the UK ultimately won.</p>
