      <p>Seems like it would also wash away the considerable ill will Morrissey has accrued over the last few years, but really, this party that he’s a part of only ever gets talked about in reference to Nigel Farrage calling them Nazis. That’s literally the only thing I read about them. I went to their site and it just seemed like some bullshit that a bunch of incels joined and that fits Morrissey kind of to a T so I really dgaf about the politics. I love Morrissey and I’m tired of hearing about celebs’ dumb politics. Nobody would have heard of his stupid party if the entire music world didn’t collectively get diarrhea when they heard about it and published it everywhere like it was gonna do anything but get that party more exposure.</p>

      <p>Behold, the 2010s unlicensed Stereogum artist power rankings™. Kanye seemed to have the best decade, with the most amount of features in the list and a relatively good average rank, but Kendrick actually had better rankings for his four spots, on average. Honorable mention to Lorde, whose two songs selected are both below 25.</p>
