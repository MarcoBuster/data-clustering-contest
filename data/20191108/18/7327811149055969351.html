      <p>UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS, Bronx (WABC) -- The search is on for the man behind a brutal and unprovoked attack in the Bronx.</p>
      <p>Pablo Vargas, 81, was standing on Jerome Avenue and reading a newspaper Thursday morning when surveillance video shows the suspect approach him from behind and kick him in the back.</p>
      <p>After knocking the victim to the ground, the attacker just walked away.</p>
      <p>Vargas said that he thought he had been punched until Eyewitness News showed him the video of the kick.</p>
      <p>He said the attack came without warning.</p>
      <p>"No, I've never seen him," Vargas said. "I was walking alone. We hadn't said anything to each other."</p>
      <p>The suspect can be seen in the video shouting or talking to himself as he walked away.</p>
      <p>Vargas was treated in the hospital for a dislocated shoulder, and the elbow he landed on is bruised and swollen and in a sling.</p>
      <p>Still, he considers himself lucky.</p>
      <p>"If he would have hit me in the back of the head, they'd be burying me today," he said.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).</p>
