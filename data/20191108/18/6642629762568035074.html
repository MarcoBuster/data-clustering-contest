      <p>Demands of employers in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> for staff grew in October at the slowest rate in almost eight years, a survey showed on Friday, underlining suspicions at the Bank of England (BoE) that the labour market may be losing its strength.</p>
      <p>A monthly index of job vacancies from the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation and global accountancy KPMG fell to 51.7 from 52.6 in September, its lowest level since January 2012.</p>

      </p>
      <p>On Thursday, two of the BoE's nine interest-rate setters <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/british-pound-dips-downward-bank-england-vote-split-191107185236108.html">unexpectedly</a> voted to cut interest rates, citing signs that the labour market - the bright spot of the UK's economy since the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> vote - may now be on the turn.</p>
      <p>Friday's REC report - which is monitored by the BoE - showed permanent job placements fell for the eighth month running and at a faster rate than in September. This chimed with official data that showed job creation waning ahead of the aborted October Brexit deadline.</p>
      <p>James Stewart, a vice chair at KPMG UK, said uncertainty around Brexit and a national election scheduled for December 12 had dampened companies' hiring plans.</p>
      <p>"It's not just businesses that are being cautious, however, and over October, we've seen job seekers become increasingly nervous about making a career change," said Stewart.</p>
      <p>The survey showed starting salaries for permanent staff rose at a solid pace in October, albeit more slowly than in September.</p>
      <p>In a new set of forecasts for the economy published on Thursday, the BoE said it thought pay growth in the UK - which recently hit a more than 10-year high - was likely to cool off a little in the coming year.</p>
