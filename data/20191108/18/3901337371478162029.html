      <p>Kaizer Chiefs’ current form and fighting spirit is a reflection of their combustible and robust coach Ernst Middendorp, attacker Khama Billiat has said. </p>
      <p>He said Amakhosi were a mirror of the German with how they now commit to challenges and with their never-say-die attitude of late. </p>

      <p>Chiefs go into tomorrow’s Soweto Derby against rivals Orlando Pirates sitting pretty at the top of the Absa Premiership table with seven points clear. </p>
      <p>“I think the coach has installed something great – work rate, energy and it’s amazing when we play how much we want to win those 50/50 challenges,” he said.</p>
      <p>Billiat himself said he has had to even help out in defence because that is simply what Middendorp demands – defensive minded players also have the license to attack.</p>
      <p>“We fight so hard and it just rubs off, we seem to be moving in the right direction. That’s a very big part of our success right now. It took long for us to get into his ways, but eventually we made progress. He is that kind of a guy – he does it everywhere, even at training. He wants the best and wants to get things done. That works for us and everyone wants to fight,” Billiat revealed ahead of the Soweto Derby.</p>
