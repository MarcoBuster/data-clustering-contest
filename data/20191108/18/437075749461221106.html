      <p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) and e.tv, South Africa’s largest independent free-to-air television channel, today announced a multiyear partnership that makes e.tv the official free-to-air broadcast partner of the NBA in South Africa.</p>
      <p>As part of the agreement, e.tv will broadcast more than 65 games throughout the 2019-20 NBA season across the channel and its Openview platform, South Africa’s first free-to-air satellite television service. Coverage will include one Christmas Day game, NBA All-Star, the NBA Conference Finals, The Finals, and weekly magazine show NBA Action.</p>
      <p>The partnership will tip off live on e.tv this Saturday night with the five-time NBA Champions San Antonio Spurs hosting the 17-time NBA Champions Boston Celtics at midnight CAT, with a rebroadcast on Sunday 5pm on Openview’s e.tv news and sport channel 120. Throughout the season, fans will be able to watch two games per week, including one live game as part of the league’s NBA Saturdays initiative and one delayed game per week.</p>
      <p>“We have always strived to make the game of basketball more accessible to our fans through participation in our sport and exposure, and we are thrilled to partner with e.tv in South Africa,” said NBA Africa managing director and Basketball Africa league president, Amadou Gallo Fall.</p>
      <p>“As we continue our efforts to expand our footprint and build on the success of three sold-out NBA Africa Games, we have seen growing interest and look forward to reaching more fans in South Africa through live games and additional programming.”</p>
      <p>“South Africa has an insatiable sporting appetite and our partnership with the NBA will most certainly appeal to that,” said e.tv managing director, Marlon Davids.</p>
      <p>“Over the past few years, we have been implementing strategic growth plans that will ensure that our sports content offering across our platforms is worthwhile for our viewers. We are ecstatic about this announcement and we greatly look forward to a fruitful run with the NBA.”</p>
      <p>The NBA has a long history in Africa and opened its African headquarters in Johannesburg in 2010. Opening-night rosters for the 2019-20 season featured 13 African-born players.</p>
