      <h1>Steve Bruce responds to Granit Xhaka transfer link as Arsenal look to sell midfielder</h1>
      <h2>Speculation suggests Newcastle are targeting the Swiss international, whose future at Arsenal looks in jeopardy after being stripped of the captaincy earlier this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T18:41:15+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Steve Bruce would not comment on reports linking <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> with a move for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/granit-xhaka">Granit Xhaka</a> , but has conceded the midfielder is "a very good player".</p>
      <p>The Swiss international has had a difficult week which saw him <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-granit-xhaka-stripped-arsenal-20819160">stripped of the Arsenal captaincy</a> by boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Xhaka's future at the club looks uncertain following his outburst at Gunners fans when leaving the field in the match with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>He faces a potential backlash from supporters the next time he pulls on an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> shirt, with the club now thought to be looking to offload him to appease the situation.</p>
      <p>Newcastle are one of the club's rumoured to be considering acquiring his services, but it seems their interest is news to manager <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> .</p>

      <p>When <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-boss-steve-bruce-17225926">asked about the Gunners ace</a> , Bruce said: "Granit Xhaka?"</p>
      <p>"Look, I was only in the job two weeks and I was linked with 42 players. So I am not going to comment on anybody else's players.</p>
      <p>"He is a very good player."</p>
      <p>Arsenal are fearful they may have to sell Xhaka in January for less than his market value, due to his tarnished relationship with the supporters.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old swore at fans as he walked off the pitch in the draw with Palace last month, as the home crowd inside the Emirates led a chorus of boos.</p>
      <p>Emery's decision to remove Xhaka from his 'captain's group' has been backed by former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>Xhaka was signed by Wenger for £30 million, although was appointed as skipper by Emery this season.</p>
      <p>Wenger said: "As a manager you have to face these kind of decisions.</p>

      <p>"We always face the unexpected as a manager, you have to make quick decisions.</p>
      <p>"I think Arsenal Football Club is respected all over the world because it’s built on values and everyone has to respect these values and the manager has to get them to be respected.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal, for me, had always had a touch of class, for me football today in the modern era has a huge responsibility on the way we behave, the way were are examples.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal are part of the big clubs in the world and we have to show that."</p>
      <p>Xhaka has since missed all of Arsenal's last three matches, and will not be included in the squad for Saturday's trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>When announcing Xhaka's sacking on Tuesday, Emery said: "I think we need time because he is one of our players and we want to protect him."</p>
