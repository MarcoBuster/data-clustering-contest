        <b>The Japanese band supported Sheeran on recent tour dates</b>

      <p>Despite<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ed-sheeran-announces-18-month-break-concluding-mammoth-world-tour-2542675"> announcing an eighteen month hiatus</a> from live gigs at the end of his ‘Divide’ tour in summer, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> made a surprise return to the stage alongside Japanese band ONE OK ROCK during their Tokyo gig earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The band supported Sheeran on a number of Asian dates on the ‘Divide’ tour, and the British megastar returned the favour at the Yokohoma Arena.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/8543057/ed-sheeran-surprise-japan-one-ok-rock-tokyo-concert"><i>Billboard</i></a>, ONE OK ROCK’s frontman Taka brough Sheeran out on stage, who then played guitar on the band’s track ‘Wherever You Are’.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, they collaborated on a hit of Sheeran’s own, taking on 2017 smash hit ‘Shape Of You’ before Sheeran departed the stage.</p>
      <p>It’s not the only time Sheeran has broken his self-imposed hiatus. In September <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-ed-sheeran-make-surprise-appearance-at-khalids-o2-arena-show-2549153">he appeared on stage</a> at <a href="http://nme.com/artists/khalid">Khalid</a>‘s O2 Arena show to sing his verse from the pair’s collaboration ‘Beautiful People’.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sheeran’s manager Stuart Camp has said that the singer, ‘who’s been <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ed-sheeran-is-the-uks-richest-celebrity-under-30-after-doubling-fortune-to-170-million-2562128">named as the UK’s richest celebrity under 30</a>, is conscious of ‘overkill’.</p>
      <p>“I never want anyone to be bored of him. But I guess if he’s top of the charts then they’re possibly not,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ed-sheeran-is-conscious-of-overkill-says-his-manager-2562749">he said</a>.<i>“</i>You just want to make sure that’s a fair representation.</p>
      <p>“We’re very conscious of not doing overkill. Bizarrely, we’ve been doing it for 10 years where we really have overkilled, but no one seems to be sick of it.”</p>
      <p>He added: “We are very conscious of too much Ed Sheeran.”</p>
