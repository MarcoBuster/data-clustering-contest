        <i>Messages sent to British Hindus signed off with name of Tory-linked businessman Kapil Dudakia</i>
      </p>
      <p>British Hindus are being targeted by WhatsApp messages urging them to vote against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> in the general election, accusing the party of being “anti-India” and “anti-Hindu”.</p>
      <p>The messages have also included videos by far-right anti-Muslim activists and have raised fears they are attempting to exploit tensions between British Pakistanis and Indians, as well as different religious groups.</p>
      <p>One message said: “The Labour party is now the mouth-piece of the Pakistani government … It is anti-India, anti-Hindu and anti-[Indian prime minister Narendra] Modi. So if there are any Indians who are still voting for Labour, or are still members of the Labour party – then respectfully I say, they are traitors to their ancestral land, to their family and friends in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india">India</a> and to their cultural heritage.”</p>
      <p>At the top of the message it said: “Pass this to every true Indian.” At the foot of the message was the name Kapil Dudakia. The Guardian contacted Dudakia, a businessman, but he declined to say whether he wrote the message.</p>
      <p>In a recent blog on the Hindu Human Rights website, Dudakia wrote that Labour were “a bunch of left-wing nutters indulging in their prejudices”.</p>
      <p>Dudakia also spoke at a Diwali event in the House of Commons hosted by the Tory MP Bob Blackman last month, from which Labour MPs were reportedly banned.</p>
      <p>An attendee told the Guardian that Dudakia shouted at the audience to vote Hindus and not Muslims and said that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a> were the only party for Hindus. Dudakia said he spoke at the event in a personal capacity. The Conservative party has been contacted for a response.</p>
      <p>The attendee who contacted the Guardian said: “I was told numerous times no Labour MPs were invited because they are anti-Hindu. The whole two hours was all about vote Conservative, and nothing to do with the festival of Diwali. It was the most uncomfortable thing I’ve ever been to.”</p>
      <p>Videos sent to Hindu voters via WhatsApp include one in which the rightwing broadcaster Katie Hopkins complains “Islam is taking over my country”, as she criticises a demonstration about Kashmir by British Muslims taking part on Diwali. Others messages include videos by Anne Marie Waters, who leads the far-right For Britain party.</p>
      <p>Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the Labour MP for Slough, said: “I urge my Hindu and Sikh British compatriots: don’t fall for the divisive tactics of religious hardliners, trying to wedge apart our cohesive community, circulating lies on WhatsApp.”</p>
      <p>Details of the messages have emerged after the president of Overseas Friends of BJP UK, Kuldeep Singh Shekhawat, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/bjp-supporters-start-campaign-for-tories-in-uk-general-election/articleshow/71911496.cms">told the Times of India</a>, the group was actively campaigning for the Tories in 48 marginal seats. The BJP is India’s ruling Hindu nationalist party.</p>
      <p>He said: “If the entire Indian community in the UK votes Tory, we will see a swing of around 40 seats to the Tories. This will swing the actual election result.”</p>
      <p>At party conference in September, Labour enraged the BJP when it passed a motion calling for humanitarian and international observers to enter the disputed region of Kashmir. The motion came after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status">Delhi’s decision in August to revoke the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.</a></p>
