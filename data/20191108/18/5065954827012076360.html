      <p>SAITAMA, Japan—Naoya Inoue won a unanimous decision over Nonito Donaire on Thursday in the World Boxing Super Series bantamweight final.</p>
      <p>Inoue, the IBF world bantamweight champion from Japan, sent Donaire to the canvas in the 11th round at Saitama Super Arena with a body blow to the abdomen. Donaire got back up to finish the round and the bout but couldn’t turn things around.</p>
      <p>“This fight showed my real strengths and weaknesses,” Inoue said. “After a year of fights, I’m satisfied to win this championship.”</p>
      <p>The three judges scored the bout 116-111, 117-109, 114-113 in favor of Inoue, who improved to 19-0 with 16 knockouts. Donaire, who is from the Philippines, dropped to 40-6 with 26 KOs.</p>
      <p>Donaire opened a cut above Inoue’s right eye with a left hook in the second round. He was in control until the fifth when Inoue landed a right hook to the jaw, stunning the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Council world bantamweight titleholder and seizing momentum.</p>
      <p>On the undercard, Nordine Oubaali of France (17-0, 12 KOs) defeated Inoue’s younger brother, Takuma Inoue (13-1, three KOs), by unanimous decision to retain his WBC bantamweight title.</p>
