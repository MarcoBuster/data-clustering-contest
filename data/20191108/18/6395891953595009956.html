      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - The planned opening of London's new east-west railway, Crossrail, was delayed again Friday as costs increased by up to 650 million pounds ($832 million).</p>
      <p>The 73-mile (118-kilometer) line, which will be formally known as the Elizabeth Line - after Queen Elizabeth II - is Britain's biggest infrastructure project in decades. But amid program risks and uncertainties, the total price tag could now hit 18.25 billion pounds ($23.4 billion), way ahead of the original budget of 15.9 billion pounds in 2007.</p>
      <p>"We are doing everything we can to complete the Elizabeth Line as quickly as we can but there are no short-cuts to delivering this hugely complex railway," CEO Mark Wild said. "The Elizabeth Line must be completed to the highest safety and quality standards."</p>
      <p>It will provide a new link between Heathrow Airport in the west of London, the capital's traditional center and the Canary Wharf business district in the east of the city. It includes a 13-mile (21-kilometer) underground section through the heart of London.</p>
      <p>When completed, the project should bring some measure of relief to commuters who pack into carriages and often endure insufferable travel during rush hours.</p>
      <p>Caroline Pidgeon, who chairs the London Assembly's Transport Committee, described the announcement the latest development as "appalling news for Londoners."</p>
      <p>"The delay creates huge issues for many businesses that have made investment decisions based on its original opening date of December 2018," she said.</p>
      <p>The project has been plagued by delays. It had been set for completion by December 2018, but that time-frame had already slipped even before Friday's announcement.</p>
      <p>Project managers said they needed the time to test signaling software; complete the installation of equipment and trial-run the trains.</p>
      <p>"Crossrail Ltd will need further time to complete software development for the signaling and train systems and the safety approvals process for the railway," Wild said.</p>
      <p>"The trial running phase will begin at the earliest opportunity in 2020; this will be followed by testing of the operational railway to ensure it is safe and reliable."</p>
